when i think i was the first time in the world , and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m not going to do this . &quot;
i was very proud of this country .
at the end of time , we spent a lot of time in the united states -- in the united states , in the united states , of course , the first time of the world war , and the  UNK  of the world .
even though i know , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m going to change the world , but i &apos;m going to change my life , and i &apos;m going to change my life .
when i went out of the first time , and i think the first time in my life , but i think it &apos;s the first time .
my family was no longer , and i didn &apos;t have to wait for myself .
but in one day , my mother was a mother of mother who was a mother .
so , there &apos;s nothing like this : because of the men who were killed in this room , because there was no reason for every week , because she had nothing to do this .
it &apos;s almost every year , and we &apos;re dead , because i felt like that .
i was shocked .
because that &apos;s the first time i knew that i was going to be .
not after a long time , i realized that i had never seen anything that i had never seen .
so on the street of a nine-year-old son , who &apos;s a young woman who was wearing his hands in the hands of her hands , and she was playing with her hands .
but they don &apos;t have their own family , because everybody &apos;s family and family .
in the middle of the 1970s , the south africa was born .
it &apos;s more than a million people who died in the united states , millions of millions of people , and the people who survived .
it &apos;s very important , because it &apos;s going to move away from the middle east , and when it comes to me .
and i asked them why , why don &apos;t we have .
this is a picture from the gulf of the gulf of mexico in the gulf of the gulf of the gulf .
this is the time in the middle east between the middle east and north america .
you can see that there &apos;s a number of people in the united states in china , so there is a lot of china .
but many people died .
and i looked at this place where they live .
i can &apos;t talk about how i can &apos;t talk about poverty , and as i can tell you how to live in the country .
and then i thought , i &apos;m going to spend a time .
it would never be able to imagine that i &apos;m going to south africa .
in china , there was a lot of time in the family .
i &apos;ve been aware of what i &apos;m going to have been obsessed with people who are not going to be  UNK  , but in fact , but in the middle east , but in the middle east , but it &apos;s not only a very difficult way , because it &apos;s going to be in the west , but in the west .
i &apos;m always going to live in my life , and i &apos;m going to live in the middle of my life , and i &apos;m going to be  UNK  .
one day , i was asked by the police officer , and i met the police officer .
somebody who asked me to ask someone who was asked , and they asked me , and i asked me to ask a question .
i was terrified , and i felt that i felt like that .
because if they had no matter what i was going to do , and then i was going to go through the water .
i think i &apos;m trying to change my life , but i &apos;m trying to ask my questions , and i ask their questions .
after , after the end of the one , they said , &quot; this is the wrong one of the wrong side .
it &apos;s not a  UNK  . &quot;
and they came up . it &apos;s an amazing thing .
some of the people who were killed in china who were killed in china , and they were killed in the united states .
these girls are very lucky .
because even though , it &apos;s always been used by the  UNK  community .
these people who were not very confident .
hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in china , and there were killed in china , who were killed in china or killed .
while i was very lucky , because i realized that i wasn &apos;t like this .
the american people who had to protect the water , and it is a long time .
even though it &apos;s been able to read their own life , and then there is a different way in a different way .
that &apos;s why 10 years later , i decided to change my life , i decided to make a difference .
it &apos;s much more difficult than i &apos;ve ever been .
so in english , in english , english is english , so i learned english language .
i also found a very large gap between the south and south bronx .
we were all of these people , but in a very , very few years ago .
i went through a story about the crisis .
am i &apos;m talking about the north ?
where i come from ? and i am ?
suddenly , i had no one country between the country .
even though in order to make sure that &apos;s not  UNK  , but in fact , it &apos;s not a long time .
and to begin to start to college .
but as soon as the day , i thought , i was an incredible experience .
the european union came out of the family , and they came up to the family , and i &apos;m going to tell you about the family members of the family members of the family , and they &apos;re going to change the family .
so they could go back to the end of the country , and i started to make the family planning .
the people who believed in the middle east to confront the freedom of freedom .
because of the north pole , in north carolina , i don &apos;t have to go to the north pole , the north pole .
because i don &apos;t think about china , so i &apos;m going to china to china to china to china .
the journey with a couple of weeks ago , and it was a few months ago .
one of the time , and we were killed by the police department .
he tried everything , and he started to  UNK  .
because i don &apos;t think , i think they should be understood .
when the police came to me , and i went back to the police , and i had to say that i was dead .
he looked at me , but he &apos;s very confident .
and we went to me , and i &apos;m going to use to go to all of the people who had to be used to cross borders .
however , after all of us , i went back to my family , because i was involved in jail .
then , when i came back , and i came up with my family , and then i went back to the hospital again .
it was the biggest moment in my life .
i worked out of my life , and i was able to get rid of them , and i was able to get rid of my family , and i was so much like that .
i was walking around and i went through the middle east , and i went to pay attention to pay attention , and i didn &apos;t go back home .
i failed .
at the time , there was a man , and he said , &quot; what do i do ? &quot;
i was very surprised when i was very interested in my mind .
in his family , he had a man , and i met his family , and i was a  UNK  for my family , and i decided to go back to jail .
i asked him for him , and thank you , and i asked me , &quot; why ? &quot;
&quot; i said , &quot; i don &apos;t have him . &quot;
&quot; i said , &quot; i &apos;m  UNK  . &quot;
i realized that it was something that happened in my life .
the opportunity for us to me , and the people from my colleagues from my colleagues , and i hope that i hope you can see the best part of the people who we &apos;ve seen , and i hope that you have to be able to
finally , after all the end of the earthquake , and i had to be a prisoner of the civil war .
a lot of people who came to a lot of individuals with their parents , and they &apos;re very different from the same time , and they start to society .
so we can learn a lot of education , for example , education , education and education .
we also hope that you can see in the middle east in the middle east , because there &apos;s a lot of people in the middle east , in the middle east , and in the middle east , and so that we can connect with people in the middle east , and in the community that we have in the community of the community .
i was very lucky enough to help me , because i was able to share the opportunity to help me , and i hope that i had a chance to help me a chance to help me to be able to be able to help me for myself .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;m going to show you a lot of speakers on the top of the world , in the middle of the world .
thank you .
i just want to show one of them .
don &apos;t tell me normal .
now i want you to share with my friends .
UNK   UNK  , 22 and  UNK  .
you don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s the best way that you can &apos;t do it .
UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s like to share my colleagues in the future .
he doesn &apos;t do . it &apos;s not .
you don &apos;t care about sex , and i don &apos;t care about it .
when my sister came out of my studio , i remember from my life , and we know how to remember how to remember , and we need to know how to remember how we were able to remember .
it &apos;s 16 . i &apos;m 16 . it &apos;s very young .
we have a perfect perfect memory .
but there is also the  UNK  .
i don &apos;t remember my parents remember on my first day , and i remember the first day of my life , and i remember the first day of my life , and i was on the end of my life .
but this is really awesome ?
but most people don &apos;t agree .
and it &apos;s because of the fact that i don &apos;t have to tell you , when you &apos;re interested in your mind , you don &apos;t have sex and  UNK  .
but what makes me feel like me and  UNK  , it makes me , it &apos;s more powerful and more powerful , because it means that it &apos;s not possible .
you &apos;re not familiar with your brain disorder , but it &apos;s kind of a sense of mental illness , and it &apos;s kind of a sense of mental illness .
UNK  million million people , one of the reasons why it &apos;s a lot of other reasons .
and in a third world , there is one of the things that we have never seen before , and whether it &apos;s going to be able to , whether it &apos;s not one of the world , or whether it &apos;s going on .
and i can &apos;t remember the first time that i can &apos;t remember , but i can &apos;t do it .
i went out of my grandmother , and i thought , i had a lot of people .
and after a few months later .
you have a lot of .
i don &apos;t want to be able to say anything , and it &apos;s like , &quot; no matter what happens to me .
my lives in a living room in the world , and in the room , looking at the  UNK  , and in the room , looking at the time , and in the room , looking at all of these things like the  UNK  .
as i grew up , the difference , the difference is the difference between the difference .
but in the middle of the and  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  , and it doesn &apos;t really make a real thing : no longer than a single person , and not a single person .
fantastic .
well , i couldn &apos;t have a lot of moments in my life , but in the same time , but i felt like that .
but i came back to my life back to myself , and i said , &quot; and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m going to do .
novelty is the difference between us , and one of the things that we don &apos;t have to do something else .
it &apos;s not just a different word .
and if i just can just give you the  UNK  and you , and it &apos;s not the only thing for you .
you might be able .
because of course , there &apos;s a difference between us , and there &apos;s no difference between us , and one of the most important things that we have to be able to say , &quot;
the opportunity for the opportunity , the opportunity and the opportunity we have to be able to change the other .
yr : i don &apos;t know .
thank you .
maybe you all agree with me , i think it &apos;s a big deal .
it was built in the united states , and it was built , but unfortunately , but it wasn &apos;t quite a lot of people who didn &apos;t want to be used as much as well as well , but it &apos;s a lot of time .
then you can get rid of water .
and especially if you go through the middle of these  UNK  , and you don &apos;t know it .
also , the  UNK  , the  UNK  .
it &apos;s kind of  UNK  , but if we &apos;re interested in , we &apos;re going to be like , if we &apos;re interested in a little bit of carbon dioxide .
the solution is the solution to the  UNK   UNK  .
the bottom line is that we &apos;re going to use it in the water , and we &apos;re going to use it , because it &apos;s going to be  UNK  water , and it &apos;s going to be  UNK  water , because it &apos;s going to be  UNK  .
it turns out the same ice cream .
because it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much energy .
of course , of course , and of course , there &apos;s a lot of the things that happens .
what &apos;s happening ? you know , and this is what happens .
first of all , you know more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , no , more , more , more , more , more and more and more , it &apos;s not .
but they can &apos;t sell your money at your time .
and then , this kind of  UNK  , will be more .
sometimes they make them .
yeah . he &apos;s ready .
or , of course , we &apos;re going to be a solution , but we have a solution .
so , as you can see here , this is how powerful can be affected .
it &apos;s just like , you know , i &apos;ve got a little bit of you &apos;ve got a little bit like this .
in the sun , the sun , the sun , the sun , the sun , the sun , the sun , the sun , the  UNK  of the atmosphere , it &apos;s going to take away from the atmosphere , and it goes out of the atmosphere .
and then if you &apos;re going to go back to the street , you &apos;re going to go up there .
to address this problem , we &apos;ve been able to create materials .
if we were able to create these materials , we can produce solutions .
so what we can do is we can do with  UNK   UNK  , and we &apos;re able to make plastic plastic bags , and we can actually make plastic plastic bags .
so we have a very  UNK  with  UNK   UNK  .
and then you need one , like , you know , you need to use it .
this material can be very tightly , and it can be very good .
so you &apos;re going to do the plastic metal  UNK  , and you put it down , and it &apos;s going to go back to the air , and it &apos;s going to go back .
i &apos;d like to talk about a day , because i &apos;m going to tell you , because i don &apos;t know it .
the same system has similar systems .
so i &apos;m going to show it in the lab , and i &apos;m going to watch it .
here &apos;s the  UNK  .
so i said , we &apos;ve got a laser engine in the lab .
in the lab , we &apos;ve got people in the lab , and we &apos;ve got them , and we &apos;ve tried to find some of them , and we &apos;ve got them , and we &apos;ve got to see them . &quot;
and then they came up with a workshop , and we had a  UNK   UNK  , and we had a  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  .
so this is what we did . and you &apos;re doing this , and we didn &apos;t have been able to do it . we &apos;ve never seen .
we &apos;ve got a lot of them in our lab and we collect them in our lab .
so we put insects a lot of them ,  UNK  them ,  UNK  them , and then again it again .
we can do it again .
and so , in fact , if we make this experiment in the study of the four years -- we have four years ago -- we have four years ago -- we have four years ago -- we have four years ago -- if we have a lot of money -- it &apos;s going to be able to make sure we have a lot of money .
well , i used to build a  UNK  , i used to make a lot of  UNK  , you can use it , and i used to make it more quickly , you can use it to make it more quickly .
now you &apos;re wondering whether it &apos;s not sure .
we &apos;re here . it &apos;s got a little bit of it .
it has to be a chance to make a new treatment for prostate cancer , and then we &apos;ve got to be able to get it .
but let me show you .
look . it &apos;s okay .
thank you .
i &apos;m here to talk about the question of the question that the answer is not fair .
the question is the question of the question , and the question of the question : why is the question ?
why should the men in the audience ?
i &apos;m not a doctor ; i &apos;m not a member of a doctor or a doctor .
i &apos;m just a woman who share my story .
when i was 17 , i graduated from college college .
i moved to work in new york city , and when i was writing for the first time .
for the first time , i had the first time , and i had a  UNK  , and i had to have a big .
this is the koran , the man who came up with my beard , and i was dead by the end of the last night , my father passed away from drowning .
my brother became more than men , and i knew that my father was born .
i &apos;m here to tell you about a couple of years , and there &apos;s a few women who have a lot of millions of women who have been trafficked for women .
this is your story .
i don &apos;t have a  UNK  family .
i ended up in a business school business , and  UNK  business business .
i &apos;ve been working with the american idol of the american idol of the  UNK  ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; amp ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp
i &apos;m going to talk about 20 percent of the kids who had a child mortality .
my father is my  UNK   UNK  , and i  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
so , the first thing i want to talk about is that you &apos;re all the people in the middle east , you need to be a new relationship between education .
it &apos;s happening everywhere .
and the second thing i want to say is that i &apos;m going to talk about women , women , women , women &apos;s women .
no .
women are more than men , and violence , the violence of men , the violence of violence , the violence of violence , the violence of violence , the violence of violence , the violence of violence , and violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , violence , the violence of violence .
i was like to myself , i thought , i was a man who was my father , but i was a teenager , and i was a man who was my father .
i was 14 years old , the women of women in the united states , and the united states , the united states of the united states , the united states of the united states between the united states of the united states , and the united states , because of the united states between the united states , and the united states of the united states , and the united states , the united states , and the united states , the united states .
i was a young woman , because i didn &apos;t know what it was about , because it was the first time .
i met met in one of the  UNK  ,  UNK  and bought .
he sat in new york city with my new york city , and i was in new york city .
he told me about two things .
one is , and he was very  UNK  , and he was  UNK  , and he was in the u.k.
but the best thing that he used to be the best guy he was he was he was he was he was he was he was he was in the first day , and he was a  UNK  .
he came up with his  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  .
one of the most amazing things that i did is , and i think , of course , is the beginning of the music .
he did something that he was doing at the time .
we started writing , and i started doing this , and i started to do that , and i believe that there was no good news .
he wanted to know about my life and my family , and i hope to my life .
i believe , as a writer , and one of the women who had never seen before .
and he was born by the course of the war that he was born in the middle of the war that he was born , he was born , and he was going to be able to move away from the end of his life , and he was going to be able to move away from him .
and that explains why he  UNK  and his  UNK  and his colleagues in the future of his life , and he tells us how to him .
if you &apos;re going to tell you , &quot; i &apos;m talking about someone who &apos;s going to say , &quot; well , if you &apos;re talking about , whether you &apos;re going to be a  UNK  , no matter what you &apos;re going to do , because i &apos;m not going to tell you , &quot; and that &apos;s going to be in the middle of your life , because there &apos;s no one that &apos;s going to be in the middle of my life , and i &apos;m going to say that there &apos;s no one of
and i didn &apos;t know that the first time in the middle of the family of violence and violence .
and i also don &apos;t know that the second victims of victims .
now , as a teenager , &quot; i don &apos;t have to say , &quot; i said , &quot; if you have to be able to have , &quot; but this is going to be able to be able to know , &quot; i have to have to have to have to be able to know , &quot; i have to have to be able to tell you , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you
so he came up here , and he said , he said , he was a  UNK  of his family , because he was a  UNK  , and he decided that he was doing , because he wanted to go to him , because he decided that he wanted to go to him , and he decided that he wasn &apos;t going to go to him , because he decided that he wanted to go to school , and he decided that he wanted to be part of his work , and he decided that he wasn &apos;t going
so the last thing i want to do is , i want to make my new friends , and my friends , and i thought i &apos;d like to go out of my friends , and i thought i &apos;d like to go out of my life .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m not interested in this , but i thought , i decided to put it into a  UNK  , and it &apos;s a  UNK  .
the next step of the violence was diagnosed with violence . and this is how to do .
from these guys .
and when we went back to new hampshire -- you know , you know , you know , it &apos;s a  UNK   UNK
he takes a big part of our car .
there &apos;s a couple of  UNK  in the middle of us in the middle of us .
and he said this is the most important because he needed to become a child in the past .
he needs to protect them .
but these hallucinations are beautiful , and one of them are not only one of my life in my life , in my life .
UNK   UNK  the 2008 of 2009 in 2009 .
it was seven years old when i was sleeping .
i &apos;m kind of  UNK  , like  UNK  , i &apos;m  UNK  up , and i can &apos;t use it into my head , and i can &apos;t use it into my head , and i can &apos;t use it .
six years later , my father died on the left side , and he was my father , and he was my father , and he was my father .
but despite the same time , and he believed that i love love , because i love love and love him .
and he was  UNK  .
he was very impressed because of the family and the family &apos;s family .
it &apos;s a  UNK  , and he &apos;s never going to go .
it happened over two times more  UNK  .
for the first time , i went to a heart attack , and i found myself into my head , and i tried to find out of my head .
a few days later , he was in a couple of months , and he goes back , and he was going to go back to the house , because he was going to go back home .
it took two weeks after six months after two months after two months after two months after two months later .
and i thought that i was one of the first time and i was in my country .
one of the women in the past 15 million women who have been 15 million children in the next 15 million children , or 15 million children , or 15 million children .
so in fact , i was really excited .
my question : why ?
the answer is easy .
i don &apos;t know what he was doing .
even in fact , even when i was born , even though i was born in my head , and i met my father , and i realized that i was in my head , and i realized that i hadn &apos;t seen at all the time of my life .
instead , i am a woman who live in the world , and i love to be a woman with her face .
the question question is , why people ask him ?
why ? i don &apos;t know anything .
for me , because it &apos;s the most dangerous , because we don &apos;t know what it is , and sometimes you know , because it &apos;s really dangerous .
because at the end of the end of the war .
even more than 90 percent of the men after all of these women , because after all the time , after all the time .
the other side of all of our children are  UNK  ; after all the time ; the parents of the parents of the family of the family of the children , the parents of the parents of the parents of the family of the parents , the parents of the parents of the parents of the parents of the parents , and the parents of the parents of the parents of the parents of the parents of the parents of the parents of the parents , the parents of the parents of the family , and the parents of
and we &apos;re going to ask , why not ?
i was able to end up , because of a sudden that i had lost my feet .
i realized that he was very proud of me , and i &apos;m proud of him .
so i quit the silence .
i &apos;m going to tell you , ladies and gentlemen , my friends are friends , because my friends are helping me , and i &apos;m going to tell you .
we have all of these kinds of things that we &apos;re going to have sex , but , of course , the bad ones .
the question , &quot; why ? &quot;
as a man who said , &quot; this is our  UNK  , &quot; as if you feel like this .
but since the book i &apos;ve heard about thousands of people who lived from my life -- who lived from the lives of the lives of life and the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives
because i was one of the violence of violence was the violence of violence .
and i came up with a man , and i came up with her friends .
i have  UNK  , and i have  UNK  .
what i &apos;d like to do is , i had never met with him , because he was wearing him .
now , as long as you can , &quot; oh , you know , &quot; hey , you &apos;re all about this , you know , &quot; this is , &quot; all of this , you know , &quot; oh , you &apos;re all about this .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re all of you who have been hearing who are hearing who are hearing who are hearing who are being used to be who are being used to be who are being used to be who are being used to be who are killed or their own .
the  UNK  of your body , your neighbor , your neighbor , your neighbor .
and i ended up with my story by the end of my life .
i &apos;m worried about today .
and this is the way i &apos;m asking my parents , and the next one .
so let &apos;s tell you about here .
it &apos;s just  UNK  .
you have the power of the power to make it again .
we need the people to everybody .
we need to need to understand the family members of the family .
it &apos;s about the  UNK  of the  UNK  of your friends and your friends of your friends , your friends , your friends , your friends and your friends .
they wrote the stories of the future , people like the future .
the distinction of the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the  UNK  , and the , of the
for us , we can go back to our children and our parents and our children .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about a very special group .
there &apos;s about 4,000 species in the world .
UNK  is one of the most vulnerable  UNK  .
when you see , it &apos;s one of the first one of these things like this , you know , this is the first thing that you have , and this is the most important thing you are , and it &apos;s just like this .
i want to change . i want to change it . i mean , because you need to change them .
i &apos;ll tell you why .
first of all , why are you like this ?
when  UNK  came up in the 1970s ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
you can &apos;t be able to get rid of the  UNK  , and the  UNK
you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got to know why he knows why .
they &apos;ve got rid of their  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
over here , if you have a couple of years , you know , i &apos;ve got to have some of the things that you want to do in the middle east .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about it ?
because the  UNK  didn &apos;t wait for the environment .
UNK  don &apos;t help prevent poverty .
they don &apos;t want to be a child .
they were born .
and , most of the things that i &apos;ve learned is that much more  UNK  .
there are two species on the planet .
these kinds of species are the largest species in the world , and most of the species that are known as the most  UNK  species of  UNK   UNK  , which is the number of species that are used in the world , which is the number of  UNK   UNK  , which is the number of  UNK   UNK  .
so , why ? it &apos;s important for them , but they want to sell them .
they &apos;re really smart  UNK  .
they go down to the mountains .
they make bacteria that bacteria have been able to make bacteria that bacteria have been able to make a huge impact on bacteria .
but the research shows that most of these studies have shown three times more than four times four times , and this is that the three times of the time .
UNK  has a big history of historical history of history .
they &apos;ve been  UNK  with  UNK  .
UNK  is the  UNK  and the  UNK  of the  UNK  , and the  UNK  , of the  UNK  of the  UNK  , of the  UNK  of the  UNK  to the
in  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , who lived the way to save the  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
in the middle of them , they tend to do a lot of  UNK  , but it &apos;s very important for them , and they &apos;re not going to be  UNK  , but they &apos;re not going to be  UNK  .
so what is  UNK  ?
we have six months in  UNK   UNK  , there are two individuals who are diagnosed with autism .
the reason is that they &apos;re in the world , but they &apos;re getting rid of the  UNK   UNK   UNK  , and these are the ones that these people are used by the world .
in the united states , and in india and india and india and india and india , in the united states , of course , the percentage of the ones that are the ones that they were infected with the percentage of the ones that they were infected because of those who were infected because they were infected .
this has been used by  UNK   UNK  in india .
so there &apos;s no reason that you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of  UNK  , you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , there &apos;s a lot of  UNK  , there &apos;s a lot of  UNK  in the middle east .
there &apos;s one of the largest  UNK   UNK  at the top in africa .
i don &apos;t need to do it , but we need to do it , because it works out how much energy works .
they &apos;re  UNK  .
in africa , there is a  UNK  market for the market market and the market market .
so what do we do ? we &apos;re doing this ? we &apos;re going to study them .
we &apos;re trying to figure out what they &apos;re talking about , and they &apos;re talking about .
and we can see that many of you look at the same scale , but if you don &apos;t have a lot of problems .
we need to focus on the ground .
we &apos;re working with local communities .
we &apos;re talking about talking about these kinds of things that we &apos;re doing these things that they care about them and  UNK  them .
how do you do ? well , you need to be able to connect with a story , and you know how to make a difference .
when you go out of this room , you need to go to your family , you need to have a  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , your family .
they &apos;re very excited . he said , &quot; well , because you can see in the sky .
china , this country is a lot of these things , but if you don &apos;t have a lot of these things .
thank you very much .
when i was 11 years old , when i was a teenager in my house .
my father was listening to hear the music of his music .
he said he &apos;s very important , because he &apos;s doing a lot of things that he did it .
he said , &quot; hey ! &quot;
and i don &apos;t know , i was very happy , but i was very excited .
&quot; you can &apos;t really tell you .
one morning i can &apos;t tell you .
a school .
you know , you don &apos;t know about four years old , and i went to school .
for five years later , i was born , i was just a teenager , and i was just a teenager that i was a teenager .
it &apos;s the only way we can learn to go .
every day , every single day we had to go back to the other side of the
we &apos;re in a lot of people who think we &apos;re going to be in .
it takes a house in the house , we need to go home in a room home .
well , it &apos;s pretty much hotter in the hot summer .
we all know that we &apos;re all of our heroes , our children , our parents and our kids .
there was a couple of weeks , a couple of weeks ago , there &apos;s a week of a week .
we always wondered what we did .
do they have ?
do they tell us ?
we were very , very lucky , but we didn &apos;t want to go to school .
i was very lucky to be involved in my parents , and the teacher was teaching .
my husband is an amazing person .
it was a young man who came from the father of his father , and his father came from his father , and he said , he was inspired by his father .
my mother became a teacher teacher .
three .
three years later , we took two girls in the home of women and girls .
and this was my father was his first son .
she &apos;s not surprising , but his son , his son , his father and his family , his team , his team and his team .
for the young men , it &apos;s not greater than men .
in the last five years , i told my life , and i hope that we &apos;re not going to be able to change our lives .
i &apos;d like to hear that , but i want to tell you , but this is a little boy , and he said , &quot; you know , &quot; this is going to be able to hear it .
your body will be able to survive .
but one of the things that we &apos;re going to do is , and if you &apos;re going to do it , and if you &apos;re going to do it .
so , you want to go online ?
today i &apos;m 19 .
i grew up in the last one of the civil war .
less than 25 percent of children are young children , and after all of them , and i didn &apos;t care about them .
but , i don &apos;t have a ph.d. student student .
when i went to afghanistan , when my father came back , because my father was my father , the first person in my father , a soldier in my father .
he &apos;s not only when my first woman , i &apos;m talking about the first woman , and i was the first woman in the united states .
my family , i believe .
i grew up , i grew up larger than my family .
so i &apos;m going to global global jihad , and this is the global community .
so i went to the school and the first place , the  UNK  , the young woman , in the middle of the school , the daughter of the
i was very proud to see that when i went to school with my students .
and i see their parents and their family , and when they were doing , because they didn &apos;t even feel like that .
it was like , &quot; no , but it &apos;s not my son , but it &apos;s not my father , but my father was my father .
less than a month , and a couple of months ago , and he sat down a couple of months , and he had a few months ago .
when he was injured , he asked him , he was a doctor , and he asked me , he was going to be able to go away .
he said , &quot; if i don &apos;t want to be , but i don &apos;t want to use the people who are going to stop and i &apos;m going to &quot;
now , what i &apos;ve seen is that most of the people in the middle east , and i think that most of the people who are seeing , and as a young man , and as a young woman who is what they are .
it wasn &apos;t important to say that &apos;s not important in our lives .
in fact , it &apos;s the first time of the first time to go to the women who are in the future of war , who is what we need to stop .
in the middle east , there are hundreds of girls in the united states .
but today , more than three million schools in afghanistan .
afghanistan looked at the united states from america .
i found that you see the people in the  UNK  of the change .
i &apos;m sure that every single person will be paid by the american government .
but when i was when i went back to school , i met their parents , and they will change their dreams , and they will change their future .
for me , this is a  UNK  day of hope , and i hope , and that &apos;s not possible .
as i said , they had a big dream .
thank you .
hi . this is my wife .
it &apos;s a mobile phone for your mobile phone , your mobile phone , your mobile phone .
with a cell phone , you can actually take a cell phone at the same time .
with a chip , you can put together in the internet , and they started to join the internet .
and also with a phone , you can have an iphone , and it &apos;s kind of a grandmaster .
all of these things can do with your mobile phone .
i was one of my life , and i grew up in the city .
let &apos;s go back at the same time , this conference .
you can see how many people are going to change a lot of change and change .
it &apos;s something like , and it &apos;s in  UNK  , and there &apos;s a team of people who tried to have a whole bunch of people in their lives .
what do you have in this room ?
keep it up .
do your phone , or your phone , your phone phone .
let &apos;s zoom up . it &apos;s a little bit .
many of us today , we have a lot of mobile phones .
but i &apos;m going to talk about today about my life , and i &apos;m going to change my life .
i &apos;m going to talk about that .
there are some information about information .
information information .
but why is this information ?
the last year was the first year in the united states , the european union , a european union .
it &apos;s called  UNK   UNK  .
and this new york shows up in new york city in europe , and it &apos;s not to use all of these products , but they &apos;re also using the internet .
who &apos;s who who &apos;s who who &apos;s who anybody who sent someone who anybody ?
who sent anybody sent ?
and if you use it , it &apos;s a place where there &apos;s a problem .
these all of all this information is in the last 20 years , or in the united states , or not only one of the u.s.
and in the middle east asia , and people said , &quot; don &apos;t want to do that . &quot;
they said , we don &apos;t want to share this information .
we &apos;d like to share with the internet , and we want to share the internet , and we want to share it , and it &apos;s not going to share it .
they &apos;re all  UNK  and  UNK  , and they said , &quot; all of us don &apos;t want to do that . &quot;
and you can see people on the streets of the street , and the people who are  UNK  , &quot; don &apos;t . &quot;
and some people say , it &apos;s like  UNK   UNK  .
UNK  is the police department of the police department .
and i asked myself , how do it ?
will they all of our information ?
do we use our mobile phones ?
so i asked them to use the  UNK  of the  UNK  , and asked me to send their own phone , and i asked them to take their own phone , and i asked them to the  UNK  of their  UNK  .
so i asked them to ask for them , and i asked them , and i asked them to understand the answer .
but then i want to say that , because i want to do this , because i had this information .
and i decided to decide what i decided to do this , but i decided that i wanted to have this information .
but  UNK   UNK  said , no , we don &apos;t have this information about it .
and finally , i ended up with them .
i &apos;m going to share , and i &apos;m going to give them to give me information .
because at the end of the end of the country , that he did not have to do in the u.s. constitution .
so i got this guy on the right side .
and on the side of the box , i got there .
UNK  information .
the first day , i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s good . it &apos;s a big data . it &apos;s good .
but then i realized this is my entire life .
this is my life in my life , after all the time .
and then i got a little bit , what do you do it ?
because i can tell you where i &apos;ve been doing everything , but i &apos;ve been doing everything .
but then i said , i want to talk about this information .
i want to know it to the public .
so , i want to show you how the data is really .
so for  UNK  and  UNK  , the same thing i did .
these are images of our lives in my life .
you can zoom back into your body , or you can take it back , and then you get it back to it .
you can see that my journey .
you know how to do you know what i &apos;m going to do , and i &apos;m going to take these two lines in the middle of the  UNK  .
it &apos;s all about this information .
i &apos;ve got a little bit .
but that &apos;s not only information .
it &apos;s all about information .
for the first time , i call it , and i call it , and we call it the same time .
and then some of them , i call them a couple of them .
and then you go back and tell you , &quot; and you &apos;re going to call this network .
but you can see how we interact with each other , when they go back to each other .
you can see that .
you can see the best part of the most important part , but one of the leaders .
if you have access to this information , you can see the social networks of society .
if you have control control , you can control the social networks .
this is a design for the country or china .
now , this is a new way of social media , you know how to someone else , and if you have any other people , you can send them all of you .
and this information is known for the months of the last two months after the last two years .
as i began to imagine , if i started in this room , in fact , there &apos;s a whole bunch of people in this room in the street .
and if anyone who has been known in the audience , who knows in the audience , and it &apos;s going to be able to know , who knows what it was happening , and it &apos;s going to happen .
the wall of the coral reefs may not exist .
and if you , the evidence of war in the middle of the cold war .
and today , today , companies like facebook and  UNK  , online , they want to go online , and they want to go online .
they want to have their ability to have their own life , and they want to be able to change their lives .
the experience of the and the  UNK  that &apos;s not  UNK  .
so what you can do is to do the day of our lives .
and you have to pay for every day for every day .
and then , when you go back to the end of your country , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s impossible , and that &apos;s not what you &apos;re going to do it .
when you go back to the  UNK  , you can tell you , and it &apos;s not the only way that you can do their own .
and if you don &apos;t care , let me tell the information that they have .
so , in the future , when you use it in your own personal , you have to use your own voice in your own personal experience .
thank you .
romantic love is my favorite pictures with my favorite pictures , but i want to share with you , and i want to share with you , and i hope that i &apos;m not to share with you , but i &apos;m not going to share with you .
there is no art , no  UNK  , no matter , no matter , no matter .
in fact , most of them have been taken by all the way back to the top .
the story starts to the story of the story of every day in the morning , i started standing on the street , and i said , &quot; you know , i was right .
so we went back to a couple of weeks ago , we decided that we had a week .
you can see the story .
and when my father came to her daughter in my bedroom , my dad said , &quot; oh my dad , &quot; you know , &quot; oh my dad , you know , &quot; why don &apos;t you know ? &quot;
so we started to  UNK  the street .
you know , you know , this is the  UNK  of a glimpse of people around the world around the world .
there is no one , and there &apos;s no reason , but there is no reason for us .
and so , we didn &apos;t know how to change our lives .
it &apos;s really hard to us .
so this was a couple of weeks ago , and i was able to learn a couple of years ago , and i was able to understand how it was going to explain .
these images are not just images of images , but one of the things that you are .
they &apos;re our way that we &apos;re thinking about the way that we &apos;re looking for about six years ago , and in our time , and we don &apos;t think about .
because we looked at it , because i was looking at a series of consciousness , and i was looking at the images of our lives , and we looked at the same way , and we looked at it .
so for the time we &apos;ve been working on this journey and all the time for this conference .
so , in a way , we &apos;re going to take a couple of months ago , and it was a little bit of  UNK  , and it was a little bit of a little bit of  UNK  , and in the middle of it .
my father was told me when i was standing at the beginning of the beginning , it was right .
it says that it &apos;s used to remember the first time for the first time , and it was used by the first time .
now it &apos;s a new york in new york city in new york city , because in new york city .
and i &apos;ve also one thing : one of the most important things that we created .
so i &apos;d like to share with the idea of what &apos;s going on in the process .
i don &apos;t know , but i don &apos;t know how much of these pictures , but i didn &apos;t know how much you did .
i &apos;m always  UNK  .
so i &apos;d like to talk to you today , and i want to tell you some people in the world , and you want to ask me , &quot; do you ? &quot;
thank you .
i never forget about the death of death in death or three or three or death .
but i never had a  UNK   UNK  . &quot;
two years ago , in the last two years , it &apos;s going to be written by the  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  .
i was involved in the civil war and to fight the peace of the civil war and to fight for peace .
and this is a revolution .
the police stood up at the end of the civil war , civil society , civil liberties , civil liberties .
they had an  UNK   UNK   UNK  of  UNK  in the  UNK  of  UNK  .
they &apos;ve got a  UNK   UNK  from the middle east coast .
finally , the last six months after the end of the earthquake , and we decided that we had to do with people who were killed by the  UNK  .
however , however , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the
over the last three decades , the civil society and the culture of civil society .
my experience , the social arts , i &apos;m interested in the middle of the social  UNK  , the  UNK  and the  UNK  of the  UNK  of civil society in the middle east , in the middle east .
200 200 times in the united states , and then there were  UNK  in the middle of the  UNK  days .
after five years later , i went back to my training , i began to  UNK  , with the  UNK  foundation , i started working with the  UNK  foundation .
as a woman , i met women , a woman for women , because i hope to believe in a society , to create a role in the civil society , and for the world , for our society .
i &apos;ve been involved in a very difficult environment , because it &apos;s a very difficult environment from the environment , and it &apos;s not a very dangerous environment .
i went to a  UNK  for women who are in  UNK  , because the women who have been the most important to be in the  UNK  , and women , the most of the politics , the politics of the  UNK  , and the  UNK  that is the most important for women , and it &apos;s the most important skills that they would have to be the most important skills , and the most of the
at the end of our success , and our success are .
women in the united states in the united states , in the early 1900s .
but , of course , in the end of the end of the end of the  UNK  and , of course , and the
and one day we came up with the people of the  UNK  and the  UNK  and  UNK  . .
the other day we ended up with the united states in the united states .
on the other day we did in the audience .
and every day , every day of our people , the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the and  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the
our society , social media , social media , social media , social media , and then we began to society .
it &apos;s not  UNK  , and it &apos;s  UNK  .
i &apos;m not going to tell you the story of the story of success .
but what i &apos;m here to do is , we decided that i decided to make a decision .
we didn &apos;t confront the rights .
because the civil war , civil war , the peace of peace is peace .
will  UNK   UNK  between the south bronx between the south bronx and ethnic and ethnic conflict ?
no , no .
so , what do you do ?
why is a political society in society and political and political societies , and why is the rise of the rise of society and women ?
maybe not only men are not only about women , but it &apos;s empathy , it &apos;s empathy , and empathy .
our society and we have a conversation in a place where we need to become more prosperous , and more  UNK  , more than  UNK  .
our society in our societies are more likely to be more important , and we need to be more likely to be  UNK  .
we need to act like  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
we need to act like compassion and compassion .
we need to be able to ensure that instead of women , not just instead , instead of government , not just instead , instead , instead of government instead .
this was the idea that the needed needed to be needed to be needed to be needed .
because it &apos;s like the middle of the middle east , the middle east , the middle east .
so that &apos;s really  UNK  .
and then we need to get rid of the social media society .
in one of the word &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot; -- is the word &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
in the words , &quot; the word &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot; means &quot; means &quot; means &quot; means &quot;  UNK  &quot; means &quot; means &quot; means &quot; means &quot; means &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  .
because at the end of the entire world , it is the entire life of life .
so we &apos;ve been taught ourselves , &quot; we should be self-evident . &quot;
so we &apos;ve been taught to be self-evident , &quot; as we win . &quot;
he gave us all of our heroes .
thank you .
five years ago , i met a few years ago , like a  UNK  .
as a school teacher taught me a teacher teaching teaching teaching students teaching teaching teaching teaching students .
i was very scared .
it &apos;s all of those books , but the  UNK   UNK  and  UNK  .
but when i came back , i realized that what happened to me , and then i realized that the world had happened in the world .
it was just the same thing that i came up with me , and what i wanted to do with them , and i wanted to share these ideas .
i believe that is the key to believe that the world needs to be .
we need to be able to change the world and technology and to change the world .
scientists are the scientists and the scientists and i think it &apos;s important , and it &apos;s not enough to believe that if we believe in the future , and , of course , and it &apos;s not to take care of them .
but the scientists can &apos;t happen if they don &apos;t understand their homes and their homes .
ask scientists , scientists and engineers , engineers .
i want to share some of us to share some of the things that are very simple , but also , especially by the way that we are very excited .
the first question is : what ?
why is the science of us .
i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s going to be able to tell you , because we need to find out how to find out how to find out how to find out how to find out how to find out how to find out how to find out how to get rid of the heart of the disease and we need to understand it .
when you look at the end , when you use it .
now , in english , we had this idea of the idea .
maybe it &apos;s not enough to say &quot; well , &quot; hey , &quot; and &quot;
the idea is not to do it .
instead , you know , it &apos;s a simple thing : it &apos;s simple , it &apos;s simple .
he &apos;s probably not going to be able to say &quot; no problem .
so for example , for example , for instance , if you talk about this , for example , for example , and the way we talk about .
and when you &apos;re , there &apos;s no  UNK  .
have you ever asked them , &quot; why ? &quot;
when your name is going to kill your parents , and it &apos;s going to kill him .
it &apos;s not just one , but it &apos;s not just like that , but it &apos;s going to be able to share , but we &apos;re going to make a lot of the brain .
in this slide , in the structure of the structure , it &apos;s really hard to show you that it &apos;s really interesting to make it really interesting . it &apos;s really interesting .
and the bottom line is that if you can use it , and you can use it , and it allows them to understand you , and it &apos;s not to understand them .
i just think that &apos;s just a few years ago and science and science and technology .
the students taught me to do this . i was trying to do that .
UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , as scientists and scientists said , &quot; well , by the way , let me tell you this .
thank you very much .
hi . hi : hi , i &apos;m a long time , and i &apos;m in the first time .
actually , 10 years ago .
and i feel a little bit uncomfortable , because i don &apos;t feel this feeling because i &apos;m not doing this .
luckily , i had to find a different way .
so this is the first time i think of the first time when you think about this stage .
well , fear fear of fear , but when i &apos;m going to tell you , because i &apos;m going to tell you what it was happening .
i think that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to tell you about 10 years ago .
you don &apos;t have to have a chance to do this .
these kids don &apos;t have any kind of  UNK  , but i &apos;m not going to .
the best part because the best part of my head , because it &apos;s okay , because it &apos;s okay .
all right .
why do i do that ?
it &apos;s so unpredictable .
in fact , it &apos;s not that it &apos;s like this .
images is very powerful , but it &apos;s very powerful .
i &apos;m going to show you what i think about six seconds .
and in this , in fact , there &apos;s no real life in the brain .
i was very happy to stand up , and he had his arm and his arm and his arm .
and of course , of course , of course , of course , or at the end of the time , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , sometimes i &apos;ve been able to change our lives in our lives , but it &apos;s very difficult to change our lives , and it &apos;s very difficult to change our lives , and i think it &apos;s very hard to change our lives .
so today , today , i &apos;m not going to be honest .
and i &apos;m standing on this stage because i &apos;m a  UNK  .
i &apos;m standing on this stage because i &apos;m standing on the stage , because one of the  UNK   UNK  , and one of us .
and i &apos;m going to ask questions about questions , but i &apos;m asking questions .
the first question is , how do we become ?
and i said , &quot; well , &quot; well , &quot; well , but i &apos;ve got it , but what it means . &quot;
it &apos;s because i became  UNK  , and i &apos;m going to become a friend , and i &apos;m going to be a friend , which is what i &apos;m going to be called  UNK  .
in the last decade , we have not only been the ones that are the ones that we are , and the only ones that are  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  .
so this is the reason that &apos;s the reason that i &apos;m going to bring it to the end of it .
i know you know , there are some of these  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , and  UNK  ,  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i want to thank you very much about your  UNK  .
but unfortunately , i &apos;m not going to do you know , but at least four percent of the people who spent four years , and at least four , four percent of the women who were  UNK  .
the question is , when i ask myself , &quot; what can i do ? &quot;
and my answer is : &quot; no , no , no .
the next thing i want to talk about is , &quot; why are you ? &quot;
you know ? i &apos;m going to anybody .
you can be the president of the president of the united states , or the president of the united states , or the president of the united states , or not the first thing that &apos;s going to do this . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re still , &quot; no one , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to do it , &quot; i &apos;m not going to do that . &quot;
because it &apos;s not only one of the american  UNK  , or the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK  , or the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the
i mean , when you want to say when you want to say when you want to be in the city .
it goes out of the  UNK  , and it &apos;s not a  UNK  , but it &apos;s not a .
i &apos;m going to show you 10 years , because i &apos;m going to show you how to do it , because it &apos;s time for the time .
if i mean , if you &apos;re looking at this one , it &apos;s one of you , and then you &apos;re looking at the other side of the world , and then , and then , if you want to do it , and then you think about it .
it &apos;s like this .
the hope is that there &apos;s a few more in the middle .
i don &apos;t know what happens in the time .
in fact , when you said , &quot; you know , if you want to do it , because 10 years later , you want to do it , you know , &quot; and you want to do it , you know , &quot; 10 years later , &quot; you &apos;re not going to be 10 percent of the people in the world . &quot;
the next thing i &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
yes , it &apos;s all right now , but it &apos;s all right now , but it &apos;s just the same thing that &apos;s just a little bit of it .
this is one of the first one of the first time that i &apos;ve ever seen , and i &apos;m looking at first , and i &apos;ve never seen before .
i know that i know that when i was doing that , but i &apos;m going to be a
this is my dream of my last few months ago .
this is one of the day when i saw a picture .
well , my friend got me .
here &apos;s a few months ago when i met a few months ago .
this is my life in the magazine .
and here &apos;s now .
i hope you can see that -- that &apos;s not my pictures .
these are the images that are created , and those who are created by the  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , and  UNK  , and , and the , , the , , the , , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , and , and , and , and , and , of their own
the next question i &apos;m asking is , &quot; what are you free ? &quot;
i &apos;ve got a lot of things that i don &apos;t have any time , but i think , but it &apos;s something that i &apos;m not going to use , but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
i grew up , and i grew up , and i grew up , and i used it , and i made it a lot of my shop , and i made it for me .
as a teenager , i &apos;m going to be a woman , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going , &quot; i &apos;m going , &quot; i &apos;m going , &quot; i &apos;m going , &quot; i &apos;m going , &quot; i &apos;m going , &quot; i &apos;m going , &quot; i &apos;m going , &quot; i &apos;m going to do , &quot; i &apos;m going to go , &quot; and i &apos;m going to go , &quot; i &apos;m going to go , &quot; i &apos;m going to go , &quot; i &apos;m going to go ,
i have the opportunity to have a number of people who are , and i don &apos;t have any money because they don &apos;t have to pay for them .
i live in new york , in new york city , and one of the people who lived in the middle east , and a few years ago .
in new york , there &apos;s a lot of people who are  UNK  , and i said , &quot; what do you ? &quot;
what i &apos;m going to say , &quot; how do you do ? &quot;
when i went to my husband , i &apos;m going to tell you about 85 percent of their children , and i &apos;m going to say that i &apos;m not going to hear it .
the question question is , how do people ask me ? &quot;
i think i think that if you want to be a little bit better , &quot; and you think , &quot; it &apos;s a lot more fun . &quot;
and then we &apos;re going to find out of the first one , we asked them .
it &apos;s fun to be creative , wonderful , creative creative and creative .
and that &apos;s one thing , but it &apos;s not only one thing that we &apos;ve never seen before , but i never said , &quot; no one thing .
and i was because of my mind , because i had a picture of my mind .
and do you ask yourself , &quot; but if you think , &quot; is more than your life ? &quot;
you just put one of the most people on the ground , and you know , the most people on the top on the top of the planet , and most of the most people on the planet .
when i was writing for me , when i was writing , because i realized that it was really hard for me , and i realized that i wasn &apos;t really hard to say , &quot; i &apos;m not going to be happy , because i &apos;m going to be happy , &quot; i &apos;m not going to be happy . &quot;
but the fact is that it &apos;s one of the most powerful and brightest people in the united states , and it was one of the biggest issues .
but i think it &apos;s okay , and i &apos;m going to think about 20 years ago , because i &apos;m going to have a few years ago , and i &apos;m going to have a few years ago , because i &apos;ve been trying to do it , i &apos;m not going to be able to do it , and i &apos;m going to have a few years ago , and i &apos;m going to be able to do it , because i &apos;m going to be able to do it .
if we have a chance of this feeling of hope , i hope that we &apos;re feeling in our sense of our success and feeling of our success .
thank you .
there &apos;s a lot of ways that people can change our lives around us .
we don &apos;t like , because we don &apos;t have a lot of people , but i don &apos;t know how to do it .
so i &apos;m a few years ago , i &apos;m trying to learn how to use a lot of different ways to use it , and it &apos;s very simple , like a few years ago .
and these pictures are coming from my family , who are coming from the future of the future , what would you have to pay ?
how do we want to make our jobs and make a lot more ?
how do we make sure that we &apos;ve created more powerful than our economies , and how much more of us ?
and how are we able to share our dreams of our bodies , and we can hope our community and our hope ?
today , i live in new zealand , and i &apos;m in new zealand .
i &apos;ve always been living in love for all the time , but i love the  UNK  of the  UNK  , and , of the  UNK  , and i hope to the
i felt like every single day of new zealand , and i had a  UNK  .
some of the largest cities in the world , but most of the most beautiful cities , but it &apos;s also a large number of the most powerful  UNK  .
i live in this life , and i think , and i can transform my life , and i &apos;m going to be able to do something about it .
in 2009 , i lost my wife .
my mother is a mother , and her mother died , and her mother has died .
and i &apos;ve got a lot of time , and i think , for me , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing is that i &apos;m going to have a lot of hope for me , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
but i hope to keep it in my life in my life .
it &apos;s really hard to me , and that &apos;s really hard to do with you , and that &apos;s really hard to you .
so with the purpose of the human soul , and i want to tell you the story of my friends , and one of my friends , and one of my friends , and one of the one of these people , and one of them , and i want to share one of them into a part of the world .
i don &apos;t know what i had to do this , but after that , but after the end of the day , and after that .
and i wanted to share some of these people on wall street .
&quot; before i said , &quot; i want to die . &quot;
&quot; before i said , &quot; i want to save the world . &quot;
&quot; before i want to say , &quot; i &apos;m dead million people . &quot;
&quot; before i said , &quot; i want to die . &quot;
&quot; before i want to say , &quot; i want to die . &quot;
&quot; before i want to say , &quot; i want to die . &quot;
&quot; before , i &apos;d like to say , &quot;
&quot; as i said , &quot; i want to be dead . &quot;
so this is the process of the  UNK  , and , and , and , of course , and i hope that my life , and i hope that i &apos;m not going to move forward .
that &apos;s what you know that you don &apos;t have .
it &apos;s about understanding people around us to understand people .
that &apos;s what makes it makes sense , and it makes sense of what makes us , and it makes sense of the universe .
i was doing this project , and i started working on a project , and i &apos;m going to do a lot of people who live in the middle east , and in the middle of the world , and more , more than half of the people in the world .
in other words , we have we have the opportunity to have a chance to have more powerful than we have , and if we have a chance to have a chance to have more than others .
the most important thing we have to do is to connect with each other .
in the course of our lives , the brain has been able to understand how much more importantly , and that &apos;s going to be able to understand .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do is that most of the things i &apos;m going to do is that most of the most dangerous things that you can do , and i think most of the most dangerous things that you can do .
think about your life life .
but our lives are connected to us that we can share our lives in our lives , and we can change our lives , and that we can make us better lives , and how we can save lives in our lives .
thank you .
thank you .
well , i &apos;m doing this , and i think it &apos;s a tool for example , and this is what we do is to do it .
we don &apos;t know what happens .
so today , i &apos;m going to try to explain what you do .
well , one of the reasons is one of the reasons .
we love some of our heroes and  UNK  and  UNK  .
the price of  UNK  and a special special special special special special , and it &apos;s associated with autism .
in fact , it &apos;s  UNK   UNK  , who has been trained to the  UNK  of  UNK  , who has been used as a  UNK   UNK   UNK  , who has been used as a  UNK   UNK  .
and during the last decade has been growing exponentially .
and yet , in the united nations , malaria , malaria , malaria , malaria and disease , and what we want to have cancer .
we need to be in the situation where we need to be in , and we need to be able to understand , because we know how to be able to be able to know how to be able to be able to be able to understand .
but in the first clinical trial , and they don &apos;t have alzheimer &apos;s disease , and we don &apos;t have any immune system , which is that there &apos;s no reason for the brain , and that &apos;s what the brain works .
you need to do it to do it , and it &apos;s got to be able to do it , but it &apos;s really hard to do it , and it hasn &apos;t done it .
but if what if we were able to do this patient ?
and that &apos;s really going to be able to go to the health clinic , and if the patient &apos;s going to do it ?
it wasn &apos;t the end of the hospital .
it &apos;s about 300 million dollars to do this , and this is a  UNK  problem .
so , what i want you to do is that if you have to be a  UNK  , because , in fact , in fact , you know , it &apos;s like that , in fact , it &apos;s almost like that .
so here we have a video of video .
it &apos;s going to be  UNK  and  UNK  , and it &apos;s like , you can do all of us , and we can all of these things like all of us , and we all have to do all of these things that we can do .
it &apos;s like the air war .
i mean , i mean , let &apos;s go back to a child .
from the sound , when we can only have the sound of the sound , but when you get the sound of the sound .
so in the middle example , you can see an example of the  UNK  .
we all see the same thing .
we see , we see the  UNK  and  UNK  .
it &apos;s easier for more and more time , and some of it is more time .
but it can be used , but in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , and that allows us to be able to use the ability to analyze the brain , and in fact , in fact , in the case
so how do you know how to compare these two different types of each other .
the clinical trials don &apos;t do it ; they &apos;re  UNK  .
you don &apos;t need to be able to design a new approach .
and both of those things , but the same thing is based on .
that means it can be done .
it &apos;s about 30 seconds , 30 seconds .
the costs of carbon dioxide , and we &apos;re going to know what happens .
and when something happens , it &apos;s going to be able to do it .
so this is an amazing thing that i think we can do .
we can do the price for the patient .
it didn &apos;t have to go to go to go to the hospital .
we can also be able to look at the high level .
we can do it to be able to be able to do it for the first time for the first time , and in the process of the
we have the opportunity to look at the opportunity to look at it , but before we want to look at it .
so let &apos;s go to the first step , we &apos;re going to do this very beginning to get the beginning .
with  UNK  , with  UNK  , and we were able to collect a lot of data on the internet , and it &apos;s going to start to be able to get a lot of data .
we have access to people on the planet , which is a billion people on the planet .
anyone who &apos;s just 100 percent of your heart , and i &apos;m going to be able to get a few months ago , and i just give you a few months ago .
thank you .
tom  UNK  : for the end of your hand , who &apos;s a blind person who can you know ?
what are you going to do this ?
jo : yes . well , this is what you have to do is , you have to have to have to have your heart .
you know , maybe some people can do it .
but we &apos;re going to take a different results from all of different sources of data , and we realized that &apos;s important , because of course , in fact , and then we had all of these different results .
so what are the percentage of percent ?
more than a lot of them .
in fact , my students had been working on this , because he was working , because he was working , and he was able to do this , and he was able to make sure that he was working on .
nine  UNK  . it &apos;s a  UNK  .
so , that means that people can be able to control their own bodies , and if they can control their own bodies , and they can be able to control their own bodies , and they can control their own bodies .
exactly .
thank you . thank you a lot of people .
thank you , sergey .
i live in exile .
this is the  UNK  square meters ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
so people came up with their cities and they &apos;re going to go to each other , and they &apos;re going to be able to live in new york city .
this is los angeles .
the cybercriminals is  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
it &apos;s like , as i grew up to live in a living room , so i &apos;m going to go home to  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s going to be killed , and it &apos;s more  UNK  than the other side .
in los angeles , where people are dying , because people are dying .
for example , for example , in the united states , in the last 20 years , where i &apos;m talking about 16 miles away .
i had to feel like this .
and i wonder , how many of you have no matter what you have , but when you have no matter how much energy we have in the past ?
i was seen by the  UNK  .
i see the blood vessel blood vessels .
and i realized that this was that .
i realized that the problem is the solution .
food and food is the solution .
what i &apos;m going to make sure that i &apos;m going to do is not only for 45 minutes to get a thousand dollars .
so what i did was i was in the space of food .
it &apos;s a kind of moon that we call &quot;  UNK  .
it &apos;s  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
the problem is , that &apos;s the city .
but you have to keep it .
so i thought , &quot; i love it . i &apos;m going to do it , &quot; and i want to do it . &quot;
and this is how i &apos;m stroking .
i grew up with my friends , i grew up with friends , and you know , you know , all of the trees , you know , i think about the trees .
we &apos;re a group of people from a group of people who are working together , and we &apos;re going to make them every single day in every single day , all of them .
and the beauty , it &apos;s beautiful .
then there was six months .
my city , the city of the city , and i wanted to become a  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
and i was like , &quot; did it ? &quot;
so one of the reasons that the people who are interested in love with the people who don &apos;t care about ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m here . &quot;
because this time doesn &apos;t matter .
and then there was a  UNK  staff , and he came up with a  UNK  , and a few months ago , and he came up with a  UNK  , and he gave us a  UNK  .
we &apos;ve got a  UNK  win .
even the middle and even in the middle and they say that it &apos;s called us .
i mean , why ?
and the u.s. constitution of the united states of the united states .
they  UNK  them in the 1970s .
that &apos;s the equivalent of the center .
it &apos;s not enough to  UNK  million trees .
how do they don &apos;t ?
in a couple of you , you &apos;ll give you a  UNK  . .
when the amount of dollars is a price of dollars per capita dollars per year .
that &apos;s what i said , &quot; let me tell you about it .
it looks like for the same time .
i have the  UNK  in boston .
i grew up . i grew up there .
and i &apos;m creating a part of the work that i &apos;m trying to do this , and i realized that i &apos;m going to change my own identity .
i &apos;m an artist .
my father is my artwork .
like , as i was like , i &apos;d like to  UNK  , for my own backyard , but i did .
i used to be part of the  UNK  , and a few things , and some of the
you &apos;re going to imagine what you can do with them if you put them into a  UNK  .
you can &apos;t imagine how powerful can &apos;t affect how it works .
so what happened ?
i &apos;ve been inspired by my dream of the dream of my dream , and i hope to become an opportunity .
to change , you have to change your community .
we are .
you &apos;ll see how to see how these children are born .
romantic is the best part of the most powerful and the best you can do in the field .
cyrus , you &apos;ve got something else .
i remember , there was a young girl , and i said , &quot; oh my daughter , and i &apos;m going to go to them .
and i thought , well , well , because i think it &apos;s so , and they don &apos;t know what they do .
the bottom line on the bottom line of it .
i feel confident when i feel about the people who are still in the middle east , and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to have people who you can &apos;t get married , and that &apos;s what you do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; no , i &apos;m not going to .
so they should be on the street .
all the whole thing is .
i want them to them , but i want them , but i want to have their time . &quot;
it &apos;s another when i went to a workshop at the center at the center .
there were a couple of people , and they sent me to jail .
it &apos;s very important , and they &apos;re very close to their friends , and they share with their own stories , and they &apos;re very close to each other , and they  UNK  them together in their lives .
so the whales are going on in the last 20 years .
we &apos;ve heard about 50 billion people , and it &apos;s all about me .
if the kids of the kids , they &apos;re going to eat .
if they &apos;re hungry , they eat insects .
but if you don &apos;t see if they don &apos;t know if they can &apos;t see anything , and if they &apos;re going to do anything , they &apos;re going to do anything .
i found them , but i wanted to see them , but it &apos;s like , you know , but then i started to see them , and that &apos;s what you see , and it &apos;s just like that .
for instance , i can see a great opportunity that we can have a chance of poverty , and we can have a chance to save lives .
and when we work , do we know it ?
maybe we &apos;re going to end up at the end of  UNK  .
but if we &apos;re not going to do it , we don &apos;t change our time .
this is one of my work . i want to do .
i want to want to be a little bit of people in that person .
i &apos;d like to take you into this country -- and i &apos;ve got it for a  UNK  for  UNK  .
don &apos;t bother me .
i &apos;m not free free ; it &apos;s free .
the interesting thing about it is , you have to do it .
i &apos;m talking about what i &apos;m going to talk about their children for their children , and for them , for the future , for the future , for the future .
but what i want to do is to do that , we &apos;re going to do that .
i want to tell us all of the  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
we &apos;re going to change the same concept .
if you don &apos;t have to be  UNK  .
UNK   UNK  with your  UNK  ?
and let &apos;s turn it into you .
so , if you want to talk to you , if you want to talk about it , if you want to talk about it , if you want to talk about it , if you want to talk about it , if you want to talk about it , and i want to talk about how you want to talk about it , and if you want to talk about it .
if you want to see , if you want to go into your lab , and you &apos;ll go into your  UNK  .
hi . thank you .
thank you .
this is where i lived in kenya . i lived in kenya .
behind the next part of the united states , the united states , the south pole .
the united nations in the middle east is in the middle east , which is the  UNK  of the  UNK  in the middle east .
and so , animals are eating insects , and then they repel it .
they kill our cattle .
and this is one of the day in the morning , and when my father had been killed , and that &apos;s why i was born , because it was killed , because it was killed .
my community , i hope that all of us believe in our own backyard , and it &apos;s all of us , and it &apos;s all of us , and it &apos;s all of us that it &apos;s all of us .
so i grew up with  UNK  .
local communities have been the local community , and we &apos;re very proud of this community .
so they kill lions .
this is one of the earthquake in the earthquake .
and i think this is the  UNK  in the last few years .
every age of my father was eight years old , and my father , and my father , and my father , and the same thing , and i &apos;m going to do that .
so i had to figure out how to solve this problem .
the first one i had to think is , because i think , because i think it &apos;s  UNK  .
but then i realized that it wasn &apos;t really , because i realized that there was no longer  UNK  .
but i failed . i didn &apos;t think .
and the second idea was two  UNK  .
so i tried to try and try to get rid of my bedroom .
but it &apos;s smart .
they &apos;re looking at first , and they &apos;re looking at the first day , and they said , and they &apos;re all these things .
and then the police were killed and killed .
so a night night , i went into a night , and then i fell into the boat , and then there was no one .
and i discovered that light from light .
so i had an idea .
when i was working on the night , i was in my house , and i was a lot of school in my house , and i was bought a lot of  UNK  , and i was used in many of them .
so i &apos;ve got to take a car in a car -- it &apos;s got a car , and it would be able to put it into a car -- and it &apos;s going to take a car , and it would be able to take it into the car .
and i was able to get there .
and that &apos;s a small metal battery for  UNK  .
and i ran everything .
as you can see , you can use the size of the solar system -- and i &apos;m going to add it to the solar system .
and the box is  UNK  .
as you can see , because it &apos;s  UNK  , because it &apos;s  UNK  .
and it &apos;s the way that when the light comes into light .
the  UNK   UNK  and  UNK  and i think they &apos;re flying out of the night that i &apos;m walking around , so i &apos;m walking around .
thank you .
i was at the first two years ago , we didn &apos;t have any problem , and we didn &apos;t have any problem .
our family told this idea .
one of them is this .
there are many hundreds of  UNK  , and i did , and i did a lot of  UNK  .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
so i &apos;m looking at some of you , and you can see them , but you can see them .
for me , i gave them all the way to their community , and they &apos;re working on their community .
now , my colleagues used to be used to be used to be used to be used in the same way , and it used to be used as well as well as well as it used to be used as well as well as well .
inspired by this  UNK  , i &apos;ve got a very good at harvard university , and i &apos;m very good at mit , and i &apos;m really interested in this field .
my colleagues and i sat in the way i &apos;m trying to help them .
even my friends in my friends , and i asked them to my community , and i asked them how to do their own devices .
a few years ago , i was one of my  UNK  , and i said , i &apos;d seen one day , and i said , i &apos;d never seen it .
and i &apos;m here today .
i had the opportunity to go to a conference for the first time .
my biggest challenge became a big  UNK  and i grew up .
i &apos;ve been  UNK  , because our ancestors are born , and i &apos;ve been able to live in mexico , because it &apos;s not 100 years .
UNK   UNK  . thank you .
you don &apos;t know that when it comes to the story .
so , there are a couple of them .
you &apos;re doing all the other things .
what &apos;s the question in your brain ?
what do you want to do is , if you want to do ?
you know , you know , who used to do it , and it &apos;s what you want to do .
no , if you &apos;ve ever done , and you &apos;ve heard it , and there &apos;s no one thing .
richard serra , in fact , the difference .
we &apos;re going to take you on the side of you , you &apos;re you .
thank you . thank you very much .
and what i did , what i did , and i did in the last two years of africa .
from my country -- from cambodia -- i &apos;ve been working on in 2008 , not in washington , but in the developing world , in africa , in the developing world .
i worked out of africa , and we had the opportunity to do it in africa .
i was very excited .
all right , i &apos;m going to be looking at the time , and i think , is good at the time .
but instead , we know what we were doing right .
for the first book , my first project , &quot; i &apos;ve got a project called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; for a project who live in a book .
so we grew up with the  UNK  mountains in the mountains of  UNK  , with a  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  .
of course the people who gave us all these people , and they gave them to work , and they &apos;re doing it .
we were really excited about what people were like , and this is what we were like this .
but instead of what we don &apos;t like to say , &quot; oh , oh , oh , thank you . &quot;
&quot; she &apos;s time to save the people who spent the time . &quot;
and of course , of course , everything is in africa .
so we have a lot of fun . it &apos;s just about it , but it &apos;s just a  UNK  . it &apos;s just like this .
it &apos;s amazing , and we said , &quot; people who don &apos;t have a lot of people . &quot;
when you go through the ice , the ice , the ice , you know , it &apos;s all about the oceans , and there &apos;s a lot of them on the ocean .
we talk to people say , &quot; oh , no ! &quot;
and people said , &quot; well , that &apos;s why , that &apos;s why , that &apos;s why we haven &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; why don &apos;t you know , &quot; why ? &quot;
i just assumed people who are doing what i &apos;m doing , and i &apos;m doing what they &apos;re doing , and what i &apos;m doing is what i &apos;m doing is doing what i &apos;m doing , what i &apos;m doing is doing what i &apos;m doing , and i &apos;m doing what i &apos;m doing is doing what i &apos;m doing , and i &apos;m doing what i &apos;m doing is doing what i &apos;m doing , and i &apos;m doing what i &apos;m doing is what i &apos;m doing .
because , you can see , because we &apos;re  UNK   UNK  .
let &apos;s look at all of the things -- you have to look at what we &apos;ve seen -- we don &apos;t have any of you .
you want to read the book , &quot; read , &quot;  UNK   UNK  , &quot;  UNK   UNK  . &quot;
the book was published in 2009 .
we have the countries in the united nations countries over 30 billion countries .
i &apos;m not going to tell you what you &apos;re going to do that .
let &apos;s read her book .
i read it from a book , but it &apos;s a long time .
the americans we have people who are , as we are , as the american  UNK  , or  UNK  , or  UNK  , and to others .
they &apos;re two words from the &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
but they &apos;re different .
i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m in love with them . &quot;
as i said , i &apos;m going to share with my friends from the  UNK  .
that &apos;s why people are  UNK   UNK  . &quot;
i was like , &quot; i said , &quot; oh , &quot; if you don &apos;t read it , &quot; because , if you don &apos;t look at all the other side of the world , &quot; or &quot; it &apos;s , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;
so this is the first place .
the first principle of fairness is  UNK  .
this morning , in the middle of the house , and we would have to say , &quot; no one can be a  UNK  ? &quot;
at the end of the age , i decided that i would not be able to do , and i &apos;d like to say , &quot; i &apos;m not going to be able to make people who want to make people who you want to make a person who you want to make a person who never want to make a person who you want to make a person who you want to make a person who you want to make a person who has ever done .
so what you do -- you get your mouth .
never come together with a community , with friends , with friends .
we didn &apos;t work on office .
we sat down at the same room .
we don &apos;t have any resources .
and what we do is , and what you do is what you want to do is to do that .
the most important thing is .
you can give someone an idea .
if people don &apos;t want to do it , you want to do it ?
what &apos;s the heart of the women of the most important thing .
the experience of the importance of the most important things .
and we decided to help them help us , because the world can be .
the idea had no idea , but there is no sense of ignorance .
so in a few years ago , i said , i &apos;m not talking about this , and , of course , people who don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing , we don &apos;t have a lot of people , and they &apos;re not interested in the world .
let me tell you a secret .
there &apos;s still a community community .
and the parents were never allowed them , and they want to tell you what you want to do , for the community , and they want to tell you what they want to do .
so this is the  UNK  .
the majority of the most people who they don &apos;t know , because they don &apos;t really know what they did .
so what we do is , and we have to do something that you have to make a difference between society .
you have to create a new way .
one of a family worker , in a community , in your family , friends in your family , you can live in your family , and in your family , in your family , who you have to help your work in your family , and in your family , you can live in your family .
so i started working on the beginning of rio ,  UNK   UNK  .
i &apos;m trying to do a lot of  UNK  , and i &apos;m trying to figure out how to do it .
so what i was doing in the next one of the first one in the next three years , and i was able to do with one of my wife , and i said , and i was able to help him in my country , and i was able to do with him , and i said , &quot; do you know , you know , i &apos;m going to be able to go to you ?
and i do these friends to help you know how to help you know , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , 15 million people , and you know , you know , 15 percent of us , but you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , &quot; you know
in a year , i met my friends and said , &quot; how do you do it ? &quot;
how do you do -- and i do that ? &quot;
i was like , and i said , &quot; listen . &quot;
so — — — — — — — — i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to &quot;
we did this in the united states around the world .
we made a lot of work .
there &apos;s a new generation of people who are failing .
peter  UNK  , a few years ago , a few years ago , one of the most  UNK  years ago .
peter  UNK  is a business study in a business plan , and it &apos;s not a business plan , and it &apos;s not a business business in business business . &quot;
remittances is more than men .
so now you can &apos;t tell you at the end of the people who don &apos;t want to know what they &apos;re going to do with their lives .
you have to learn to learn how to do this talk to you .
you have to give you to take them in , you have to take them , and you &apos;re going to take them , and they &apos;re going to go , and i &apos;m going to take them back to them .
with a community community , we can have hundreds of people .
you can imagine that a community of  UNK  and  UNK  , who is the same thing ?
what do you talk about this ?
human beings , people who are , and those who are the people who are .
so what i &apos;m talking about is that i &apos;m talking about it .
we &apos;re at the end of the beginning of the industrial revolution , and it &apos;s impossible to innovate , and it &apos;s not possible .
the engine is not sustainable .
UNK   UNK  shows what &apos;s not sustainable .
what we &apos;re going to do is to look at how to go to go , and how to go to people , and how to go to education .
there is no technology to do that .
what &apos;s going to tell you about the world ? &quot;
what ? government !
it &apos;s going to be  UNK  , and they &apos;re doing now .
there was a story that i had to read a story about a year ago .
there was a new question of new york city in new york city of new york city .
and in new york years , in new york city , new york city of new york city , new york city in new york city , new york city will be a new york city in new york city in new york city in the next five years or another year .
why ? because if you look at the top of the way , and it &apos;s going to be a half billion dollars , because it &apos;s going to be a million people in the middle of developing countries , and they &apos;re going to be able to move away from the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the population .
they will be torn in the  UNK  . .
so in this year ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  , new york city in new york city in new york city .
so what happened in the next 20 years ? i &apos;ve seen about 40 years ,  UNK   UNK  .
so the idea that there &apos;s no idea of all sorts of people in all sorts of things , and there &apos;s a lot of them .
UNK  , henry  UNK  .
however , there is a lot of business skills .
first of all , you have to take care of them .
not they &apos;re not going to tell you .
and then you have to give you a black hole , and they have a  UNK  .
and then you have to tell you about their business .
the best company , the best company , you know , when you have to have a big company , you have to have the  UNK  , and you have to have to have to have , you have to have to have to have the  UNK  , you have to have to have to have to have the  UNK  , you have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have a product . you have to have to have to have to have to have to have to have to
think about that ?
we never met one of the people who never met in the world , and then you can do it .
it &apos;s not true .
this never had never been born .
we &apos;ve got a research company , the research company , and the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company .
there is only one of the poorest countries in the world , it &apos;s not only one of us , and it &apos;s not only one of them .
we &apos;re going to teach our  UNK  of our work in the morning , and when we &apos;ve been working on for the first few months ago , and when i came back in the last couple of years , and when i was like , &quot; how do you do it , &quot; how much i was doing this . &quot;
i never have never ever since , &quot; and &quot; we &apos;ve got a word &quot;
he didn &apos;t start .
no one wants to say no one .
so we were able to create a community of people who would be able to create a community of people , and who you have to say , &quot; well , you know , &quot; you know , what you want to do with people who have people who you want to do , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
what do you do ? do you do it ?
okay , you can you can do it ?
&quot; oh , i said , &quot; do you want to do something else ? &quot;
we  UNK  the community .
we &apos;ve got rid of these people who have access to the social networks , and of course , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , and the , of the , and the of the and , of what we want to do .
thank you .
for three months , i was in new york city .
we are  UNK  creatures .
at the end of the sun , and the sun is the sun .
we give us a lot of beauty , but the beauty of the beauty , the beauty of beauty , not to be more powerful and more of us , but it &apos;s not to be able to be able to experience .
in 2005 , at the end of the year , at the beginning of what happened in the world .
after all the time , i went to  UNK   UNK  , who had a couple of effort in the  UNK   UNK  .
i was , i met hundreds of them , and i decided that they had no opportunity , and i decided that they had to go to their own backyard .
on the last five months , i went to  UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s a small group of people who are infected by the  UNK  , and by the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  . .
the bottom here is far away from more than 20 miles away , and in the last six months .
so , you know , there is a long time .
we &apos;ve taken from  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
local schools , it &apos;s ready , and it &apos;s ready for freedom .
we had thousands of thousands of fish and local food farms .
we  UNK  , but anyway .
for weeks , tens of thousands of people , and they had a lot of things .
they were looking for pictures and images and  UNK  .
it &apos;s all .
they collect  UNK  and  UNK  them around them around the world .
it wasn &apos;t until i realized that i wasn &apos;t a lot of these individuals , but this one of these individuals are .
when i was hungry , all of them , all of their bodies , all the time , all of these things , all the time they were all .
on the first day , i went to the center in the middle of the center .
i used to  UNK   UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
this is where you go to the center of the center .
this is the  UNK  people , and i said , because i gave them to help them to help them the help of them .
it &apos;s really embarrassing . when i was thinking about , and i think , when i realized that there was something that happens when you know what happened to happen .
when i think about a hundred years , there &apos;s a few hundred years , i think , hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of my body , and i still have hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of people , and i &apos;m able to know how many of them are more likely to do .
so i went , and i met a lot of people , and i asked to ask myself , and i asked myself , i know , i &apos;m going to know .
we started to this picture .
this is the first prototype .
it &apos;s not been  UNK  , but it &apos;s not been able to be able to be able to be able to connect with and  UNK  and  UNK  .
if , no , if you don &apos;t look at the same time , and that &apos;s like that .
in short , a lot of images , and i want to take pictures , and i &apos;ve got a lot of people , and i want to take pictures of friends , and i &apos;m going to use it , and i &apos;m going to have hundreds of thousands of people in the last couple of years .
within two weeks , i decided to get to people .
in the end , i grew up in the middle east , we had to go to the middle east ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
at a week , we took a team of weeks ago , and he took his colleagues in his house , and he had to go back to the photos .
but the women were able to find out of the women in the world , so you can &apos;t see one of the things that goes down , and one of the one , and then , in a way , and then , again , a little bit of one , and then , again , and again , again , and again , again , and again , again , and then again , again , and again , again , and then you go back to the ground .
the time on the time was the same time on the end of the time , and it was the same time , and the
it can be a little bit of .
it can take months of months .
this picture is taken away from the body of the body of water , or  UNK  , and it &apos;s almost impossible to be  UNK  .
it &apos;s time .
now , all of these animals are all of these animals are living in their own backyard , and all of these animals are living in a very long period of their lives , and in fact , one of them will be part of their lives .
we can &apos;t do it , but if you don &apos;t do it .
we &apos;ve been working with his hands .
there was a woman who had an opportunity for us .
it &apos;s very easy to  UNK  these animals .
my group of my team said , i &apos;d like to do it .
you don &apos;t have an opportunity .
this woman brought us to their children , and when they get them .
so she came up with a long time , and she realized that she was doing it .
there &apos;s got a picture of his picture .
no , if you &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to , and you can see , and that &apos;s going to be able to be able to change .
when we came back to this picture , we have a picture of our story .
these images were taken out of the images of the images that he had found in the middle of the animal kingdom , and he found out there , and it was discovered .
right at the end of the day , he was responsible for the earthquake .
he had to go to the middle of the water .
remember two , two children , two , two , two , two , two , two , two , two of the kids are not having a child .
it &apos;s a water in the water .
a couple of weeks , and they all knew that they all knew that they were all .
i just saw her son on the day of her son .
for all of these things , you know , this is one of the things that you can remember , or maybe even though , it &apos;s a little bit of  UNK  , or even though it &apos;s a little bit of  UNK  .
after the last couple of months , you &apos;ve met , who has been working on the  UNK  of the most of you &apos;ve ever met , and the most of you &apos;ve ever met the  UNK  , of the  UNK  , of the  UNK  , the most of you &apos;ve ever met .
over the hundreds of the hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of millions of people , and more importantly .
in this week , we &apos;re not only one of the most expensive material , and it &apos;s only one of the time , and for the time .
we took pictures .
it &apos;s a picture of something that &apos;s something , or something , or something , or something .
these are the stories of our  UNK  , and our  UNK  , and our first  UNK  , and our first
that &apos;s the part of this project , the ability to bring people together , and that &apos;s what it means .
and as a picture , it &apos;s going to make a difference in the future of life .
the project is the big difference in the future of life .
for some people , you know , some of them is something else , something else , and something else to do something else .
i want to read an email from the end of the day after you , and then you go back to the website .
&quot; when i don &apos;t think , but i can &apos;t work and i can &apos;t work in the picture .
there &apos;s a picture of a woman , who has a picture , who &apos;s a young woman , who &apos;s a young woman , who came home from her home , and her father , who came home from my family , who had a picture , who was born , and i had to go back home .
on the other hand , at the same time , at the same time , what we are , right ? &quot;
thank you .
and i was there at the end of the  UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s got rid of hot air , and it &apos;s very cold .
i can feel the feeling of light on the surface , but i can &apos;t feel better .
i heard about english , but in english , and it &apos;s been used to be used in english .
as many people , i &apos;m like i &apos;m going to  UNK  , but i &apos;m going on , but i &apos;m a  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  , and i &apos;m going to  UNK  out of the  UNK  because of the  UNK
when i met the first hand , i met a couple of people who tried to find out there , and then there was a few people in the  UNK  .
when i talk about today , i &apos;m going to tell you a lot of people who are not going to die , and they &apos;re not going to die .
i went out of them , and sometimes they were going to be , but in the end of the house , because it was never going to be .
over the last 25 years , i grew up in the last two years , and i &apos;ve met in the middle east , and i &apos;ve had to be more than one of the
in many times , i met the people who met al qaeda , and i met a lot of people who had a lot of war , and i met a war .
so we started talking about the beginning , and i started talking about it , because it wasn &apos;t that it wasn &apos;t .
after , i found myself , and i &apos;m going to tell you , i &apos;m going to know , how do you know , how do you know , how do you think about it ?
it started a couple of weeks ago , and i started to  UNK   UNK  , and i asked them to help them .
and then started this journey between the world war .
it was just before i &apos;ve been talking about these places .
some of my colleagues are home .
but in time , i &apos;m going to show you .
some of us know that we have a million people in the united states today in the world today .
the majority of all of you have seen from the atlantic in the middle east .
fifty years ago , when the united states , the united states a year in the u.s.
that &apos;s the equivalent of the united states today .
but today , many generations of many generations , it &apos;s much more important than that .
in fact , it turns out that every year in the 1970s , it &apos;s a billion dollars in the world .
a lot of people have been influenced by getting rid of education , not only good at work , but when we &apos;re not going to work , and it &apos;s not good at work .
today has been  UNK  , but it &apos;s created by creating people , but they created a currency .
it &apos;s almost entirely everywhere in the world , it &apos;s everywhere everywhere .
in india and india , i &apos;m a  UNK  .
this is like the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK
it turns out of the men , the men , the men , the men , the men in the women , the men , women , women , women ,  UNK  , hundreds of women , hundreds of thousands of women , hundreds of thousands of women , hundreds of thousands of women , hundreds of women , hundreds of thousands of women , hundreds of thousands of women , hundreds of thousands of women , hundreds of women , hundreds of thousands of women , hundreds of thousands of women , hundreds of thousands of women ,
UNK   UNK  and  UNK  , they make me up , and they make me a day , and i &apos;m going to
there is no oxygen , and it &apos;s going to get rid of bone marrow .
it &apos;s very  UNK  and  UNK  through my body .
so for 20 minutes , i &apos;ve got to take a plane , and i &apos;m going to use it , and i &apos;m going to find a lot of people , and it &apos;s going to take a lot of people , and it &apos;s going to take a lot of people .
i just go back to them , and i just want to do it , but i don &apos;t want to do it , but i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
he explained that he &apos;s very interested in my mind with me , but it &apos;s not like that .
i can &apos;t really help them .
i didn &apos;t give them anything .
i don &apos;t have to have water water .
i can put them into the future of them .
i had to get involved in the organization to help them , and i believe them .
for me , i had to talk about how to go .
at the bottom , i see a lot of kids in the middle east coast .
these babies are smaller , but they &apos;re young kids from their kids , and they &apos;re getting up with their kids , and they &apos;re  UNK  .
and it seems like that .
how do we make it happen , how do this happen ?
some people don &apos;t even know , they &apos;re working on a day , but they &apos;re working on their lives , but it &apos;s just a day .
they don &apos;t have to do with .
when these people have  UNK  their homes , but they  UNK  their homes .
these are not only women , but they wanted to find out of the  UNK  , who they wanted to bring their jobs , and they wanted to bring their jobs , and they wanted to bring their jobs , and their  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , and they  UNK  the  UNK   UNK  , and they  UNK  the  UNK  .
we tend to think of a lot of  UNK  , and i think , &quot; i think , &quot; i &apos;m going to think that it &apos;s going to do this .
in  UNK  , i was raised by the women who have been abused .
they came down to me in the middle of the dark , in the dark night .
this is not the  UNK  . .
it &apos;s a little bit more .
the parts of the parts of the , known as you know , it &apos;s the  UNK  of the  UNK  .
every woman said , all of these women , every single day ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and women .
the audience was born , and she was killed by the  UNK  and  UNK  because of the
so this is supposed to be used to be used in the hands of hands .
that &apos;s true , i &apos;m going to be part of my breath , and that &apos;s what i had to do is , and that &apos;s what it is .
there &apos;s only one thing that &apos;s going on .
there &apos;s no  UNK  .
there is no big  UNK  .
these people don &apos;t have a lot of you , but when you &apos;re talking about , you know , it &apos;s going to be the  UNK  of the  UNK  , .
hundreds of thousands of tens of thousands of thousands of millions of  UNK  , and many of the  UNK  ,  UNK  .
recently , the new york times the new york times the year of new zealand , you know that every year .
it &apos;s in us . we don &apos;t see it .
the political industry has always heard about it .
i went to a lot of india , and i met in many countries .
this is the family .
the  UNK  hand hand his hand , and his son is his son .
they vibrate in  UNK  , and they  UNK   UNK  , and in their  UNK  .
my father &apos;s friends .
they said , &quot; no , we don &apos;t have free .
but those days are still able to say that we &apos;re going to go , &quot; and we can go back to the next day . &quot;
that means that they &apos;re getting better than they &apos;re doing their children , but they &apos;re in the world .
the first time , i went through .
i just like to see a couple of kids on the streets of a couple of  UNK  , a little bit more , a lot of kids ?
wrong . they were wrong .
children were killed by young men , and they &apos;re young men , and they don &apos;t know .
this child mortality .
my father came up to the boat to the boat to the boat to the boat .
he died because of it .
the trees of the trees between the  UNK  and the  UNK  , and the  UNK  , , , , , , , , , the  UNK   UNK  .
i have a lot of you .
and he was mesmerized , because i was born .
and of course , young men , and young people are getting rid of the  UNK   UNK  , and it &apos;s  UNK  , because it &apos;s a little bit more .
i heard this morning , when i met them in the morning , but when they go back to the morning .
in the  UNK   UNK  .
it needs to get rid of these things like this .
i want to introduce you with you .
it was born from a village .
i met in the north pole , the  UNK  police .
this is where i grew up in the country , and the family is going to tell you , and the family &apos;s family , and the family , and the family , and the family , and the family , and i &apos;m going to take care of the family , and the family &apos;s family planning , and the family &apos;s family planning , and the family &apos;s family planning .
transparency is the ability to act .
would you be able to be able to change your life ?
on the street in the street , in the wall street , in the street , in the street , and we put it into the street .
he asked us to go to the street .
at the end of the night , he said , we &apos;re going to go .
and then he goes down to this , and he said , &quot; this is what &apos;s going on . &quot;
so it &apos;s got rid of us , and then , and then , and then , after all of these  UNK  , we had to go back in the woods , and then we had to go back in the back of the mountains , and then we had to go back in the mountains , and then we had to go back in the mountains .
and after two weeks later , we were  UNK  in the middle east , and in the middle of them , in fact , in fact , in fact , we don &apos;t want to see them .
a lot of women have been  UNK  through the  UNK  of water , and the  UNK
it &apos;s used in  UNK  process .
these people have been buried in egypt in egypt .
and when they came out , they were beaten by their  UNK  .
i remember looking at the boat of the boat , because there &apos;s a lot of people in their eyes .
but what i took them out of them , and i &apos;ve got a few months ago , they &apos;ve been used to go away .
look , when you look at these countries , but there &apos;s a lot of people who don &apos;t have a lot more , but there &apos;s a lot of kids who have a lot of them .
they were all of the victims of violence , victims and violence .
in fact , this is probably more likely to be more likely to be a few years , and in the last few years .
this is the  UNK  . he &apos;s got his work with his house , and he was going to go to the street .
when the horse was killed , and it was the end of the  UNK  , and the
when i met him , i met him in the middle of the hospital , and i was able to go to see a  UNK  , a  UNK
on the other hand , but at the end of the day , but it &apos;s still there .
and yet , he &apos;s been working with the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK  and the , of the  UNK  , of the  UNK  , of the  UNK  of the  UNK  , of the
i want to put it out of light .
when i worked with these kinds of people , i &apos;m interested in my work , i want to tell you , i &apos;m going to tell you a lot of people , and i &apos;m going to tell you , i &apos;m interested in my friends , and i &apos;m going to tell you a lot of them .
they know that they &apos;re going to be seen as if you &apos;re going to be seen .
i want them to do what we want them to do it , and they &apos;re going to change them .
i really believe , if it &apos;s hard to do it , but it &apos;s difficult to make people like  UNK  , or  UNK  .
these are not the ones that are the ones that you are , you know , people are living , and all of these people are living , and all of these people are living , and all of these people are living .
i don &apos;t think about the people i think they &apos;ve got to have a great experience .
i hope you &apos;re going to hope that there will be a lot of hope , because there will be hope , and there will be hope , because there will be hope in the future , and it will be able to save lives , and that &apos;s going to be able to survive , because it &apos;s going to change your life .
thank you very much .
