and you saw  UNK  &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the  UNK  program right before your eyes .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
and they did .
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleague universities , to help us to find and work and act like a hub to  UNK  all these  UNK  all around the world .
and i did well , i graduated with honors ,  UNK   UNK  .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the  UNK  voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have  UNK  making ...
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
and you make  UNK  and you never make that mistake again .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a  UNK  resident .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so confusing .
we love entertainment .
and the next morning , i woke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us  UNK  these  UNK  .
UNK  , creative participating communities , complete  UNK  , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .
after only one trip .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
because  UNK  like jimmy  UNK  introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of  UNK  will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
i represent children .
have you seen these guys ?
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or  UNK  is supposed to bat .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
at midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the  UNK  .
and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death penalty in germany .
a lot of my clients are very young .
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
they had sold this tool for  UNK  euros to the egyptian government .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
i gave her my whole rap , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mmm mmm mmm . &quot;
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on  UNK  .
we would never do that in our own countries .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
and these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
so now we &apos;ve  UNK  up the time scales once again .
now take the same patient with chest pain , make them moist and  UNK  and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath , and suddenly my history is  UNK  with contempt .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
drug war . mass destruction . tornado .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his throat .
three months later i had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i hop on , it sends my data through google health as well .
and whenever you are in a city like  UNK  and somebody collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cellphone , to find the nearest  UNK  which can save lives .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
they were there in february , and it snowed a lot in february last year .
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs.  UNK  .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
how do i get this removed ? &quot;
and i went back to my work on the wards .
that means hit the ball into the  UNK  , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the runner was safe .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infection , not of the throat , but of the upper  UNK  , and it can actually cause the  UNK  to close .
but that &apos;s the nicest thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients .
and rather than having economic  UNK  , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic injection ever .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my  UNK  and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
but they do the job .
the chairman of coca-cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world .
in the other , i was  UNK  in lives that were precarious , tragically scarred by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
a few weeks ago we took  UNK  to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot;
the one thing i &apos;ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a supercomputer problem .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the  UNK  , be perfect .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . &quot;
my goodness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013 .
that whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collapses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
and it &apos;s collected by my general practitioner as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need  UNK  support or something like it , but also looking backward .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of  UNK  analogous to sex . &quot;
and i think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
it &apos;s true .
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
crisis . death . disaster .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle  UNK  in new york city , i admit i wasn &apos;t very interested .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
famine in somalia . police pepper spray .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
they sort of go like this .
it &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
well in egypt , the  UNK  looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
privacy is not up for discussion .
we have three main groups .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
slowly but surely , it lifted .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
at the time i was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
he said , &quot; oh , mama tells all the grandkids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
in the united states , the institute of medicine pegged it at 100,000 .
it &apos;s all bound by oxygen and  UNK  .
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
this is bjorn  UNK  .
and i went through the same period of shame and  UNK  and felt  UNK  and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
it would be so  UNK  and so empowering .
my name is brian goldman .
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
we have the capital of the  UNK  .
say , &quot; please repeat that process . &quot;
and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very  UNK  to me .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
and similar to &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to have just  UNK  up out of nowhere .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday .  UNK  &apos; down on friday . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hugs .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
i felt like anyone could do that .
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
twice in one emergency shift , i missed  UNK  .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
unlike the settled middle-class suburbs , whose existence i was oblivious of , there was no sense of entitlement in  UNK  .
we have seven million people on probation and parole .
and there &apos;s nothing  UNK  in the history of technology development of this kind of  UNK  growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
and that &apos;s when ms.  UNK  leaned forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave , brave , brave . &quot;
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of  UNK  microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
or is it photography ?
her mother raised her alone .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
the company headquarters are right here .
so i spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about slavery .
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
well i went into the  UNK  .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
this is happening to us today .
and i put my challenge on 95  UNK  .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
thank you .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country .
and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
i was riding in a 747 with marvin minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
an entire remix community  UNK  up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
and imagine if you would a.i. &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone .
so what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
the idea behind  UNK  is that it &apos;s a growing library .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this  UNK  of beer -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
well  UNK  is a  UNK
it came out of the university of washington in seattle .
she grew up at a time when  UNK  was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered .
why did i go into medicine ?
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
UNK  are electronic modules with each one specific function .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a  UNK   UNK  canon ball .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said very  UNK  , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
these guys make money .
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .
and ms. parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her dearest friends , these older women ,  UNK   UNK  who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott -- amazing african american woman -- and virginia  UNK  , a white woman , whose husband , clifford  UNK  , represented dr. king .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
so those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
and one of the things we did at  UNK  university is we appointed a chief listening officer .
on my show , on &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; i made it a habit of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from  UNK  to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about yours ? &quot; and i would point the microphone towards them .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
but one fellow in particular , a guy named erik  UNK  , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things .
a few years ago i started developing  UNK  .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being  UNK  active .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
and i began giving her my rap .
that could be shoveling out a hydrant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
something  UNK  inside me .
&quot; moneyball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in  UNK  with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
we know perfectly where all the atms are about the city of  UNK  .
and then we look at cases like what happened in  UNK  .
it sorts and  UNK  through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
my mother ,  UNK  , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
thank you .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the  UNK  health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this holler .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a gotcha way , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody can benefit .
one of two things is going to happen .
you can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little  UNK  .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
we love innovation .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
he was placed on  UNK  antibiotics and he recovered after a few days .
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
groups like anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
this is my wifi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
we &apos;re taking off .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a thief .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated .
and that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o  UNK  , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
and before i knew it , the  UNK  was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
you see , even though aluminum is  UNK  percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
vicious cartels .  UNK  five :  UNK  cruise lines .
we love technology . we love creativity .
so to achieve a realistic result , i think it comes down to planning .
go home to where ?
it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
16 terawatts of energy hits the earth &apos;s surface every 88 minutes .
jimmy  UNK  posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &quot;
this is a chart of what it looked like .
and then it went international .
so that worked . so  UNK  for scott .
and that &apos;s important .
save those . kill off the rest .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some beer . &quot;
and the  UNK  staff pulled out all the stops .
and this has spread just  UNK  , organically , naturally .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
and those are the neural structures .
we have the passion of the diy innovator .
i looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
steve pinker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace corps for geeks .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a  UNK  curve .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
perhaps instead , it &apos;s the  UNK  brought to us of what &apos;s really going on .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
all of napoleon &apos;s troops were fed with silver  UNK  , napoleon himself with gold  UNK  .
jimmy  UNK  actually .
it would be  UNK  .
hi . i &apos;m kevin  UNK  , i &apos;m the trends manager at youtube , and i professionally watch youtube videos .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in  UNK  and sat around her  UNK  .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
they &apos;re  UNK  to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
what will these three billion people bring ?
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
all the adults knew the risks .
but where would be the nearest  UNK  to help this patient ?
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
they &apos;re using their hands .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the  UNK  of your province .
one i thought had a kidney stone .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time .
i represent people on death row .
my male uncles died of  UNK  diseases .
but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the  UNK  coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
suppose you have  UNK  and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s batting 400 on  UNK  .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
i don &apos;t believe that .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
it &apos;s not just code for america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total  UNK
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
lego made it accessible .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
now i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extinction , water and energy shortage -- we surely do .
the other nurse asked  UNK  .
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy .
1,000 , very good .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;all go ahead . y &apos;all go ahead . &quot;
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
when i say realism , i mean  UNK  .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
in this country , as many as 24,000 canadians die of preventable medical errors .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were  UNK  .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
so go ahead and start inventing .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot;
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were  UNK  encouraged .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? &quot;
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
and when i listened to her , she was making a  UNK  sound .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
my hunches again .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
the wealthiest  UNK   UNK  of the last century , the  UNK  on this planet , could have never dreamed of such luxuries .
and to report back to my attending .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100  UNK  of white powder , which i try not to let the security people see at airports .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an irresistible challenge .
and as i was walking up the steps of this courthouse , there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
and then my brother started staring at me .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
and then it happened again .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
in one , i was the classic asian student , relentless in the demands that i made on myself .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
i was taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in melbourne .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
people seem to think politics is sexy .
what do you do with certificates ?
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
this is not ...
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call  UNK  in your city .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
i spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
now i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
he kept pointing here .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they &apos;re fixing it .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking  UNK  to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with  UNK  to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess ,  UNK  is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have  UNK  of breath .
so meet al .
here &apos;s vladimir  UNK  form  UNK  in estonia .
if there is a  UNK  in our family , it runs through the women .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
they sell certificates .
well you need a certificate if you have a website that has  UNK  ,  UNK  encrypted services , services like gmail .
unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
it &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
oh , my god !
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i am a redefined physician .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
let me show you how they work .
so those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money ,  UNK  like anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
she shares her experience with others .
so this is a story of napoleon iii in the  UNK  .
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the comeback trail .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech student , it was a person from england , from manchester , a woman who , during the day , was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein folder .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
others in medicine dread them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so  UNK  .
he kept pacing back and forth .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
what does this mean ?
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
and it &apos;s that  UNK  connection that i believe  UNK  us to not just be attentive to all the bright and  UNK  things , but also the dark and difficult things .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on  UNK  curves .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
why should i worry ?
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , froze the swiss bank account of mr. sam jain right here , and that bank account had  UNK  million u.s. dollars on it when it was frozen .
and i love this : &quot; watson  UNK  human opponents . &quot;
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
let me give you an example .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic .
this is the kind of innovation , empowered by this technology , that exists today .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
i memorized in my anatomy class the origins and  UNK  of every muscle , every branch of every artery that came off the aorta , differential diagnoses obscure and common .
we &apos;ve been giving  UNK  to kids and seeing them play with them .
in fact , so lacking in confidence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs.  UNK  , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
by being totally surprising and humorous , casey  UNK  got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
he retreated into silence .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get selected out .
well it was a friday , this is true .
now we talk about water wars .
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
do you know what they call a 300  UNK  in major league baseball ?
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done historically .
and the more  UNK  i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
no had never been an option .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the  UNK  and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .
she had irreversible brain damage .
that &apos;s why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the &apos; 70s .
this is matthew anderson ,  UNK   UNK  and so on and so on .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
and i put in my motion that there was  UNK  misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct .
i never will forget it .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &quot;
at 17 she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
that means that  UNK   UNK  safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid .
for a year we were penniless .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
so here &apos;s another example .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
well there are opportunities all around us .
so &quot;  UNK  cat &quot; is a looped animation with looped music .
but if i could give it and still see them safely through , i would .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and she &apos;d squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
these might be  UNK  services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the  UNK  that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
yes ,  UNK  percent is saltwater , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
there &apos;s nanotechnology coming on ,  UNK  .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
no one has to  UNK  your idea .
we made an application for  UNK  , augmented reality , to find these  UNK  .
so the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also  UNK  in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean .
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
i began to feel a bit better .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted . &quot;
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
and they will get healthier by using the  UNK  , and they &apos;ll become better educated by using the khan academy , and by literally being able to use 3d printing and infinite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
but i carried on with my work .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i think it &apos;s very  UNK  of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
they put her on a ventilator .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple  UNK  of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
what does it mean ?
opossum ? check . living ? yep .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
two years later i was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of toronto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat .
to these  UNK  ,  UNK  became another material , electronics became just another material .
all the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in english and mathematics was  UNK  for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secondhand .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
and there &apos;s good news here .
it was called the automatic binding brick .
and i have to tell you , it was  UNK  .
thank you very much .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
my mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
centers were established .
i sometimes push too hard .
so how does it happen ?
i never knew him in real life .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
and here every piece is very well planned .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this  UNK  to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
and certainly , we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along , and many people do .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .
thank you .
i gave her medications that we call  UNK  , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
thank you .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of dna .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
oh , my god .
and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egyptian government a set of tools for  UNK  -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and i was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
it &apos;s not about being scarce , it &apos;s about accessibility .
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race , they &apos;re also distorted by poverty .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical  UNK  like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
UNK  .
and if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .
is it something about the light ?
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
in high school , a  UNK  once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test .
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .
and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains .
but i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to admit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail , in prison , on probation or parole .
UNK  is a certificate authority from the netherlands -- or actually , it was .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , justin bieber , got his start on youtube .
and it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult , to see that patient in  UNK  .
cloud computing , what my friends at autodesk call infinite computing ; sensors and networks ; robotics ; 3d printing , which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vaccines and foods ; digital medicine ;  UNK  ; and a.i.
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
wooo !
i don &apos;t take the same history .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field ,  UNK  colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
but combined , they can create something like this .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have  UNK  us .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with  UNK  as a material .
by 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
but it has an unexpected twist .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
imagine him as the communists enter  UNK  , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
legendary -- as in ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been  UNK  and released from death row .
nobody knew where the nearest life-saving  UNK  was to be obtained right now .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of  UNK  .
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot;  UNK  , do you still feel me hugging you ? &quot;
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about  UNK  .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
so what was the next step ?
and the conversation i had with dean kamen this morning , one of the great diy innovators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
i don &apos;t know .
she took me out back and she said , &quot;  UNK  , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;
and in fact , we &apos;re such a  UNK  community .
it &apos;s the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made of aluminum .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the  UNK  .
she was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and platinum .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
and at that stage , we have  UNK  communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
yet i am afraid of privilege , of ease , of entitlement .
he died broken by history .
and charles kenny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started arguing .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
now the amygdala is our early warning detector , our danger detector .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
when i think about creating abundance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
i lived in parallel worlds .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie , geeky internet culture .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
UNK  software usually takes a couple of years .
think of this , in america today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television , mobile phones , air conditioning and cars .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
pretty simple .
thank you .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citizen .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
and she &apos;s hitting a  UNK  .
and he whispered in my ear .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot;  UNK  cat ? &quot;
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled .
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
we were poor .
and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court .
and over 10,000  UNK  already in the netherlands already have been submitted .
but there &apos;s another thing .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
i spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness .
and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immunize me against making mistakes .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment .
i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an  UNK  suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
some of my  UNK  have been in the last five years .
and that means  UNK  , it means open , it means generative .
and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her .
the shores are from a different location .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
my state of alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently  UNK  you if you have a criminal conviction .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was executing people , especially if they were disproportionately jewish ?
i ordered some fluids to  UNK  him and asked my colleague to reassess him .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
she was back and near death .
in fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
it &apos;s not our problem .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
the unhealthy shame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
something really weird is going on here .
but , but , you know what ?
and i thought about that .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
it &apos;s spreading virally .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
so beyond simple play ,  UNK  are actually pretty powerful .
the three words are : do you remember ?
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pike in health .
and the snippets of  UNK  english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
tsunami warning .  UNK  .
i will never forget it .
you can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
it &apos;s about the nuance of human language .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
her father died soon after she was born .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the trashcan behind the house .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all misconduct .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a doll .
so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
and his answer was yes .
and it was what i was feeling .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
we think about energy scarcity .
i do get tired , as we all do .
last month , i had the pleasure of announcing with  UNK  foundation something called the $ 10 million  UNK   UNK  x prize .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as  UNK  , which is what the product is called , but also  UNK  .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
i met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
but today , it goes beyond that .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
i would like to talk to you about why many  UNK  projects fail .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
we have our cognitive biases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
someone made an old  UNK  version .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they  UNK  .
we worked well into each night .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
hey , why not ?
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
and to my horror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into  UNK  organisms .
he is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
and i kept asking myself these questions .
the only country in the world .
among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
he invited over to dinner the king of  UNK  .
even cats were watching this video .
and i claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
but then the technology of  UNK  came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with  UNK  mentality .
and now there are 10,000  UNK  of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
if i had really been a  UNK  , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
and i went back to work .
and also , even though it &apos;s plotted on a log curve on the left , it &apos;s  UNK  upwards .
in the 1980s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scott  UNK  did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
underpinning much of this is technology , and of late , exponentially growing technologies .
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the  UNK  projects fail , since we stopped listening .
instead of having to program , to wire , to  UNK  ,  UNK  allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
and when i listened to her chest with a stethoscope , i could hear  UNK  sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
i tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii .
but there are two problems with that .
why didn &apos;t i ask my attending ? why did i send her home ?
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve , on moore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were  UNK  .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
so  UNK  is open-source .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it &apos;s not our burden .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
four years ago here at ted , ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
it will get to you .
i &apos;m going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
here i have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
we &apos;ve also been taking  UNK  to design schools .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
but the king of  UNK  , he was fed with aluminum  UNK  .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
UNK   UNK  , the great czech leader , talked about this .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , hd video and still images , libraries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally  UNK  and  UNK  into your cellphone .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are  UNK  that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
and i got in my car and i went to this courthouse .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
so let &apos;s project this analogy going forward .
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after mrs.  UNK  before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians i know dread .
threats , in the wake of bin laden &apos;s death , have spiked .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14-year-old black male client like a privileged , white  UNK  corporate executive . &quot;
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he  UNK  things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get sued .
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the  UNK  hack .
but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an  UNK  institution , but as a problem of collective action .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
so given a dozen news stories , we will  UNK  look at the negative news .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d assault me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re  UNK  ourselves .
the redefined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
in my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything i can , from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
and their pupils would dilate , they would  UNK  , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times , but were  UNK  by the  UNK  of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile  UNK  of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qualifications .
we &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got a.i. , you can cough on it , you can do a finger blood  UNK  .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
and many people forget this .
so what we did , we crowdsourced the netherlands .
thank you .
and so i did .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
and i memorized everything .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am ,  UNK  , almost a generation older than most of them .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way .
three things :  UNK  , communities of participation and  UNK  .
and i was shocked and shaken to the core .
because the transition seems very , very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
now why do we draw technology curves in  UNK  curves ?
and it starts with one physician at a time .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
he is my grandfather .
and i go to the jail and i see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a  UNK  curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
i was devastated .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball  UNK  ?
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so i decided to change that .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for  UNK  it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it 10 to the 22 times .
and i made myself a bargain that if only i  UNK  my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
i call it the rising billion .
there was an energy there , an  UNK  optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .
mr. jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 911 and the  UNK  brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are  UNK  by crime , not do less .
but so many over the years were helped .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
and issue rogue certificates .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
and i saw mrs.  UNK  , and she was  UNK  .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
privacy is implied .
we have online criminals .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
good , really good , maybe an  UNK  .
solar technology is ...
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
he had a potentially life-threatening condition called  UNK  .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
like here , we have mr.  UNK   UNK  from the city of kiev in ukraine .
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
what about giving the oppressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
i was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto when mrs.  UNK  was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where i was working .
in both cases , these are gross  UNK  , because we really aren &apos;t  UNK  out the problem as we should .
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over  UNK  connections , so the local government can &apos;t  UNK  on their discussions .
it would be  UNK  for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about executing people . &quot;
and we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones .
take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their  UNK  , and the children inherit the traits of the  UNK  of the two programs .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . &quot;
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
what creates the illusion ?
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
but each time , they were gnawing at me , eating at me .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that  UNK  organisms have gone through --  UNK  out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
now look at this curve .
think about it , that a masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of kenya has better mobile  UNK  than president reagan did 25 years ago .
and here &apos;s the thing .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not settle into a career in law .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
because it &apos;s in that  UNK  that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
so every morning i hop on my wifi scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light lunch today ,  UNK  . &quot;
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
this is a modest little app .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
except they can if they hack into a foreign  UNK
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; opossum in my trashcan . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
we settled in  UNK  , a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
if you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
okay .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
there are billions of them .
huh . hang on a moment .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
so the white lines here are population .
no .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
can i give them a bow in their lives , dipping bravely into each wave , the  UNK  and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarantees nothing ?
because i have nothing to hide . &quot;
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
and because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was chosen as the young australian of the year .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance , but ultimately we knock them down .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
if we were captured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
you should ask for some of that .
UNK  , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sunny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
defeat would have come too easily .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a  UNK  and opened another business .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
for the first time , this year the cost of  UNK  electricity is 50 percent that of  UNK  electricity in india --  UNK  rupees versus 17 rupees .
and these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mrs.  UNK  , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
i mean , that was epic .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
i ordered a kidney x-ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a  UNK  of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
tan le , anonymous  UNK  resident , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
so what happened here ?
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
grants and sponsors were sought .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
i &apos;m sitting here making grunting sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .
and there they make great apps , they work with city  UNK  .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
because evolution could now happen within an individual .
so i followed my hunches .
what will these people want ?
you know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
and on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
because we live on a water planet .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
and the family gathered .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
okay . thank you very much .
and there is this stunning silence .
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
the bricks are color-coded .
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; i will bypass you . &quot;
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source -- saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- at less than two cents a liter .
and that &apos;s nothing .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
and i felt really good .
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed  UNK  report that &apos;s a response to the sec &apos;s request for comment on the financial reform bill .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
i &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
there &apos;s a guy in the i.t. department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .
and i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with this .
or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
for example , how a  UNK  works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
and i studied in my little  UNK  at the nurses &apos; residence at toronto general hospital , not far from here .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
it might take a moment to load .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of  UNK  took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtuous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
and we say that word with such contempt .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on ,  UNK  . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just skip -- i &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ...
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
the point is that the news media  UNK  feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
jeopardy &apos;s not an easy game .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
well she was back all right .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
so after a four-year saga that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
we asked around and nobody knew .
these people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy .
but ultimately , those realities are  UNK  by suffering , abuse , degradation , marginalization .
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called state trojan was found , which was a trojan used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
there were remixes .
we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
well  UNK  picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
this is not a finished story .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours ms. parks turned to me and she said , &quot; now  UNK  , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
two pairs of  UNK  for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the  UNK  of city hall .
in many communities , people had to worry about being  UNK  .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an  UNK  , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little  UNK  .
rebecca black &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in this  UNK  ? &quot;
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
recession . default . doomsday . egypt . syria .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; if it  UNK  it leads , &quot; is very true .
this is alfred  UNK  .
in sending her home , i  UNK  a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the  UNK  .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to  UNK  .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and he knew her , he would have been able to  UNK  additional information about her .
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
wealth , not  UNK  , shapes outcomes .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal  UNK   UNK  .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
and every now and then ms.  UNK  would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot;  UNK  , ms. parks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a  UNK  brick .
so scott gets this call .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
and if they &apos;re on a smartphone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .
societal decay . 65 dead .
so what happened on this day ?
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
and that was my first time to be  UNK  with that .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
UNK  ,  UNK  !
this is stephen watt .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a  UNK  throat .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to ted .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
it &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
they will even use tools like state trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison .
well i adored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
we &apos;re trying to end life without parole sentences for children .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
i was an obsessive compulsive student .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the  UNK  &apos;s .
i mean , how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm &apos;s watson ?
how could we help you ? &quot;
a school uniform down to the ankles , because it had to last for six years .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers .
today , there are 2.3 million .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things ,  UNK  . &quot;
so i signed the discharge papers , and an ambulance came ,  UNK  came to take her home .
there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exclusion , to  UNK  , to injustice .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole .
it connected those two people .
my mother phoned minutes later .
i had written these crazy things .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
he &apos;s the dude on the left .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of  UNK  doctors .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution .
last year , bear  UNK  posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
so that &apos;s  UNK  movement has done .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we  UNK  did .
and if that  UNK  out , which i have every confidence it will , coca-cola will deploy this globally to  UNK  countries around the planet .
you see , scarcity is contextual , and technology is a  UNK  force .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
it could happen in learning time scales .
very quickly concrete blocks became the  UNK  construction unit in the world .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
it &apos;s called batting average .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
i made the decision to move to the u.s.
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
and there were rare but searing  UNK  of &quot;  UNK  &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
goodnight sweet opossum . &quot;
and i went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and i hoped against hope that she would recover .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
but when something like this happens , things are qualitatively changing .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
they had to worry about being bombed .
right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
three times out of 10 .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
and let me show you a simple example .
we actually have several cases of millionaires online ,  UNK  , who made money with their attacks .
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
and i think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the  UNK  layer on top .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , i have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
he types &quot; opossum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and every morning i hop on it .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
they will tap your internet connection .
what about contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an  UNK  , a  UNK  is supposed to be ?
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
all right , let &apos;s go .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
telephony , computers ,  UNK  , cd-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information .
we work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage , where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous , causing havoc and death .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started  UNK  out .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
and on this curve , riding on moore &apos;s law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
it &apos;s a lobster made of  UNK  that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
yeah ,  UNK  , the judge has some magic power .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the  UNK  time scale .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
so we &apos;re the amoebas and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft back towards the earth , in 1990 after it just passed saturn ?
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4,000 followers on twitter .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
in fact , i  UNK  the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could .
and at the end of the day , i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
and we built an ipad application .
score them again .
