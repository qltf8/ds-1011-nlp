i was 11 years old , when i woke up the morning , i woke up in the morning .
my dad used to listen to the gray radio , listening to the bbc .
he &apos;s very rarely seen , because most of the news , because most of his frustration .
&quot; the taliban came out of the taliban .
i don &apos;t know what that means , but i &apos;m very happy to see it .
&quot; you can go to school , and he went to school .
i &apos;ll never forget that morning .
a real school .
i was six years old , the taliban withheld from afghanistan was illegal to afghanistan .
so after five years , i went out to my sister and i went out to school , and i was allowed to go out alone .
this is the only two of us .
we &apos;re going to go to a different route , and we don &apos;t have to suspect where we are .
we put it in a book , and we thought it would be a little bit like this .
so in school , we had a little  UNK  in a house .
it was very comfortable in winter , but in summer .
we all know that our own life is dangerous , teachers , and the parents , and they understand .
sometimes a week , the schools were closed because of the taliban .
we &apos;re always worried about the taliban .
are we tracking ?
they know what they &apos;re ?
we &apos;re scared , but we still want to aspire to .
i was fortunate enough to be to be educated .
my grandfather was in his grandfather .
he was born in afghanistan , and he kept insisting on other people who kept insisting on his mom , and he went to school , so he had been forced to her father to school .
but i was educated .
that &apos;s her .
she retired , she retired , and she turned into a school , and she turned into a school .
my dad was -- that was his first family was in his family .
so no doubt that his child should be educated , despite the taliban , despite the taliban , despite the taliban .
it &apos;s a little bit more difficult to educate children .
in the taliban , i remember the taliban , sometimes i remember that i was frustrated about being blind , and i can &apos;t see the future .
i &apos;d like to give up , but my father said , &quot; my dad would say , &quot; my daughter &apos;s life , you may lose anything in your life .
you might pay for money , you might steal from your home .
and the only thing that you can live here is that we have to sell you , if you have to pay the hands of the  UNK  .
but are you still going to continue ? &quot;
now i &apos;m 22 years old .
and what i grew up in the last decades of war .
i was a woman who graduated high school after high school , i couldn &apos;t stay high school , if i don &apos;t stay with my family .
and now i &apos;m a proud of college graduates .
it was one of the college arts college in the united states , where i was in the united states in the united states in the united states , and when i went back to afghanistan , i went back to afghanistan , and i went back to my grandfather .
he &apos;s not only because i am a proud of college because i was the first woman in my first woman , and i was driving the first woman in kabul , and he was driving the streets of kabul .
i trust my family .
my dream is , but they dreamed up .
and that &apos;s why i became the global ambassadors , and that &apos;s why women are working on global education .
and that was the first reason that i started to create a first class of afghanistan , and it was the only afghan women in afghanistan , because it was very dangerous .
let me get excited , i see my school , and i was able to see my ambition .
and i saw their parents , especially fathers , especially fathers , like me , and they were supporting them , despite their faces .
for example , this is not my real name , and i can &apos;t see him .
less than a month ago , he was on his way back to the way up to the near the side of the road .
he had a warning , he got a warning voice , if he had a warning about his daughter &apos;s going to happen again .
&quot; if you want to kill me now , you can kill me . &quot;
in afghanistan , i realized that -- this is the western state of the western countries -- that we don &apos;t realize that this is what we can recognize his own daughter is that his daughter &apos;s own daughter &apos;s success .
that &apos;s not the mothers who said that we don &apos;t succeed .
in fact , in order to be the most popular ones that are the most likely to be in afghanistan , but we have to be in afghanistan .
in the taliban went to school , and we had to go to school , please don &apos;t forget about illegal distinctions .
but today , the girls who are educated in afghanistan today .
there &apos;s a big difference between afghanistan .
and i found that in the united states , we can see in the united states .
i was concerned about how long they were able to sustain this .
but when i went back to afghanistan and i saw them and support them and their parents , and i see them , and i hope that the future will continue .
for me , in afghanistan , and i hope , the likelihood of afghanistan , and i was reminded that in every day .
like me , they have a dream .
thank you .
and what i did was , whether i was living in my life on the entire life of the entire life in africa .
from 1971 , i started in 1977 , and i looked like this young , but i was in zambia , and i was in kenya , and in kenya , in algeria , nigeria , and in somalia , in kenya .
i was working in italy , in italy , and we built a program .
i was stressful .
i was 21 years old , and i think we &apos;re doing good things for africa .
but what are we doing .
and the first program i wrote my first book , i wrote a book called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; and in this case , we decided to live in zambia .
so , we went to italy , and we came to the south of the valley in southern zambia , a  UNK  valley in southern zambia .
and of course , the people who didn &apos;t pay their wages for their salaries , and they come up for a moment .
there &apos;s a valley where the people who don &apos;t feel very surprising .
but we haven &apos;t asked them , and they just say , &quot; wow , &quot; we are . &quot;
when the hunger is out of the  UNK  , the people out of the ground . &quot;
of course , africa is very good .
we have a beautiful tomato sauce in italy .
it &apos;s unbelievable . it &apos;s an unbelievable number of people . &quot;
and when the tomato sauce came out of the  UNK  , the  UNK   UNK   UNK  , the first  UNK   UNK  all the time to come from the  UNK  .
and we said , &quot; oh , my god , these are the  UNK  !
zambia : &quot; yes , that &apos;s true , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t farming . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot;
and i thought we had this incredible creativity in africa , but when i knew that when i was going to be proud of the united states , and then i was proud of this project , and i was very proud of this project .
because we feed ourselves .
you should look at the garbage -- how many of the people -- how many of you have to trust , how many african people will trust .
you can read this book , called &quot; dan  UNK  , &quot; dan  UNK   UNK  , is a woman economist  UNK  .
this book came out of 2009 .
we &apos;ve spent the last 50 years in the past 50 trillion dollars .
i &apos;m not going to give you the money that i &apos;m going to pay you .
you go to read it .
look at a woman in africa , what we bring about the big damage .
we are the westerners ,  UNK  , and the  UNK  , and the way we &apos;re dealing with people , and the two , and the two things are the parents .
that &apos;s the root of the root from root , &quot; fathers , &quot; fathers are fathers . &quot;
but two different words .
the parents of the parents who were treated like me as a child . &quot; i love you . &quot;
and i mean , i think as a servant , as a servant .
and that &apos;s why white african white boss is called &quot;  UNK  .
i was reading books , when i was reading the book called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is the economist , &quot; he didn &apos;t want to be the most important economic growth of the economy .
it should be the first principles of aid .
the first principles of respect is respect .
and today , i &apos;m going to show you a stick on the floor , and we said , &quot; can &apos;t think we can &apos;t imagine ? &quot;
when i was 27 years old , i decided to create a system that was based on my company , and i founded a company called  UNK  , and we didn &apos;t do it , and we didn &apos;t have a better place for people , and to find a better place for local services for people .
so what we &apos;re going to do .
we &apos;re going to go into the community , not going to be treated with each other .
we don &apos;t work at the office .
we met with clients with a bar .
we don &apos;t have infrastructure .
and what we do is we find is they &apos;re finding out and finding them .
most important .
you can make your clients come up with your clients .
but if you &apos;re not interested in each other ?
the client is the most passionate commitment device .
that &apos;s the most passionate building blocks , the foundation of the self , that &apos;s the most important .
and then we collect information and knowledge , because it &apos;s relevant information , because it &apos;s in the world .
and the idea that people don &apos;t understand that knowledge , but we can support us .
so many years ago , i had a thought , &quot; why don &apos;t we can do that , at least , and we don &apos;t want them to impose the idea of the community , but we can &apos;t impose the idea of the community .
i &apos;ll tell you a secret .
the community is there .
entrepreneurs never met , they wouldn &apos;t even have to tell you where they &apos;re going to tell you where they &apos;re going to go to business .
so , there &apos;s a plan .
you don &apos;t even have the most smart people in the community , because those who are not involved in the public .
we have a one-to-one relationship with the one-to-one ratio , to build a one-to-one basis , we have to build a infrastructure .
we have to create a whole new career .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a professional doctor , who &apos;s going to face you face in your house , or your home kitchen , or your home , or your home , or your talent , and you will make a living room for a living .
i was in the state of western australia ,  UNK  .
i was reading , and i was trying to get rid of bullshit , bullshit , and it only bullshit .
i was in the first year , just to take the first year , and i was in the first computer , who was the first one of the first person in the garage , and he was able to sell the first fish in garage .
i &apos;m going to make a fisherman , it &apos;s not a high school for 60 cents a dollar for a dollar to sell a factory for 15 cents to 15 cents a dollar for 15 cents a dollar for 15 cents , and then i sell it to japan , and i say , &quot; hey , hey , you can help ? &quot;
within a year , i was doing 27 violations by a year , and i asked him , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
how do you do that ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what they say . &quot;
so -- that &apos;s the government .
we have 300 communities around the world .
we &apos;ve built a company .
the new generation of entrepreneurs who are failing .
peter van  UNK  was one of the greatest consultants before , before dolly and a few years ago .
peter van  UNK  , before the business professor of philosophy , a professor of peter van allen who said , &quot; well , the economy is actually  UNK  business . &quot;
it &apos;s a business plan for entrepreneurship .
now , we &apos;re trying to rebuild our new zealand , and we don &apos;t know how to be the most smart they wanted to do their energy .
we have to learn how to make them .
we have to give them respect , dignity and respect , and they are very good at privacy , and they &apos;re good at doing it .
in a community of 100,000 people . we have 200 clients .
how many of you think about 400 of 400 people , and how many of the community ?
who &apos;s the most of you come from ?
it &apos;s a passion of entrepreneurship .
so what i &apos;d like to say is the spirit of today .
when we were at the end of the industrial revolution in the industrial revolution , we were able to use the industrial revolution , but suddenly , we suddenly realized that it &apos;s sustainable .
there &apos;s always been a fuel out of the fuel .
it &apos;s also cold enough food .
what we &apos;re going to do now is how we care about sustainable , and how we are going to feed a billion people .
there &apos;s no technology at the level of technology .
who can this invention of technology ?
right ?
entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs who are fighting . they are fighting .
many years ago , i saw an interesting article on a paper .
so , there are experts who are invited to speak in new york city .
that was  UNK  ,  UNK  , they &apos;re all about 100 years later , they were able to make sense of new york city .
why ? because they look at the curve , if they look at the curve , and if you go on the speed of new york , they &apos;re going to take six million barrels .
it &apos;s going to be lost .
so , they think they &apos;re going to be  UNK  in new york .
well , what about 40 years later ? in 1900 , one of the united states in 1900 , one of the united states .
it &apos;s a new kind of technology , which is not good .
for example , michigan  UNK  .
however , there &apos;s an entrepreneur .
first , you need to give them .
they &apos;re not going to talk about you .
and you have to focus on their services .
you want to tell them .
whether it &apos;s small businesses or three small things can do : i can do everything to do : smart marketing , smart marketing is smart enough to be efficient .
what is the problem ?
there &apos;s never been a single person in the world at the same time .
it &apos;s not there .
this is not yet born yet .
we did surveys , the world poll that came out of the world -- the company , the company , the company , the company , the company of the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company of the company .
the world is successful business in all the world , there &apos;s only a company that has no business .
now we &apos;re at  UNK  in britain &apos;s  UNK  , and we started to learn how many  UNK  , we started to start with richard branson , and we started to see how many of them came up with their heads .
i said , &quot; no , we didn &apos;t use 32 times . &quot;
he was just starting to get out of nowhere .
nobody could ever develop a company .
so we can build a community , in this community , and we have a  UNK  in the community , and you &apos;re in the background , and you can offer a community that you can offer up , and you need to help us ?
what are you doing ?
can you go out and sell you the money ? &quot;
&quot; ah , i can &apos;t help you . &quot;
we inspire communities .
we had a team of volunteers who helped the entrepreneurial spirit of an entrepreneurial talent , and we found that we could create a miracle of the community that can change the economy , and you can use this kind of ingenuity and use this kind of energy .
thank you .
five years ago , i had a little bit of like alice in the past .
i &apos;ve got to teach this to teach me to learn how to teach students to communicate .
i was terrified .
i was really scared . these are frightened by the brain , and they were  UNK  , and they were using it long , and they &apos;re all scared of the words that i &apos;ve got scared .
but as the conversation began , as i went through , as i was going through the door of the rabbit hole in the world .
and that &apos;s my students and the conversations that i felt that i was surprised to feel that i wanted to be surprised to feel like this .
and i believe that the key to the door is to communicate with communication .
to change the world , we need to get a good scientist and engineers .
our engineers and scientists and engineers are solving the biggest problems that we face the biggest challenge of the energy challenge , from the environment , if we don &apos;t understand the environment , we don &apos;t understand what it means , if we don &apos;t understand what it means , we &apos;re not able to interact with them .
but if we look at engineers and engineers , we &apos;re not going to look at them , we &apos;re going to look at them .
so scientists and engineers and engineers said , &quot; well , let &apos;s talk about high-tech .
i &apos;d like to share some useful ways to tell you how to make sure you feel sexy . &quot;
the first answer to question : how do we get high-tech ?
let &apos;s tell us why science is not about science .
and i tell you that i &apos;m going to tell you that this is because i tell you that this is important to recognize that the treatment is important .
and when you describe the science of describing the scientific principles of science .
the term is a barrier to you .
and of course , you can say , &quot; why is the empty space , &quot; why is it ? &quot;
let me give you a simple idea to simplify it .
instead , as you say , as much as simple as possible .
you don &apos;t have to change your perspective , you don &apos;t know the scientific theory of science .
so you can think about stories and analogies .
and there &apos;s also a slide that shows you don &apos;t use them .
you want to think about the symbols of them ? &quot;
bullets are the bullet ? you can see the red light on your forehead .
like this slide is not just boring , but it &apos;s tedious , and language , and we don &apos;t know what to do .
and this is a picture of a story of the inspiring story of the slide , even if we have a special effect on the  UNK  , even a unique structural element of design .
here &apos;s the trick here is to use the word of the audience , even though the viewer provides a little bit of stimulation , we can understand the images of the sensory experiences that we can understand the images of what we can understand .
so , these are the doors that allow us to open the doors to help us feel to feel better .
well , because i &apos;ve worked with the engineers who taught me to be an academic , and i want to think about a equation for me .
you &apos;re looking at the scientific research , you know , you know about them , you know , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do with the content , you know , and you &apos;re trying to think about it means that it &apos;s amazing .
so , scientists and engineers and scientists , when you solve this equation , and i said , &quot; well , i said , &quot; well , let me tell you .
thank you .
one of my favorite words in oxford , in oxford . &quot;
not only because it sounds good .
and it &apos;s a politician . &quot;
although it &apos;s just a little bit of the 19th century , he said , &quot; well , he said , &quot; you know , he said , &quot; no , he says , &quot; no need to care of any kind of  UNK  , or any party in any kind of  UNK  , or whatever it is doing . &quot;
i don &apos;t understand what i mean by the way .
it &apos;s about words and words , i suppose .
but the words of the political power of politics is very important , and all politicians have to try to understand that they &apos;re trying to control them .
for example , parliament , the parliament was only allowed to cover the story of the politicians talking about politicians .
and actually , it &apos;s actually a great name , that &apos;s the great name of the parliament .
he was knocked on the door of london , but he was brave enough , he had enough to have the courage to have the courage to win in london .
and just a few years later , we had the first use of words for the first time .
a lot of people think of phrase .
no , it &apos;s not a story .
but in order to understand how the impact of politics and influence , i want you to go back to the united states .
and then they had a question of how george w. bush , george w. bush .
they don &apos;t know .
what should it be a great leader ?
so the question is , in the long time .
and there &apos;s a lot of advice , and it seems to be possible .
i mean , some of the people who want to call him the  UNK  , and he called george washington , and he called george washington , and george washington , and the freedom of  UNK  .
there &apos;s no name .
some people want to call him a king .
they think it &apos;s been a test of the past .
they didn &apos;t even have a broken relationship , and then you can see how they are a king .
you know , it would be possible .
and every week , everybody feels  UNK  , and it &apos;s  UNK  , because it &apos;s actually a week .
i had read a journal of the parliamentarians , and it was recorded . &quot;
and the reason why they &apos;re tired of the representatives of the representatives of the senate .
we don &apos;t want to make it out of washington .
they don &apos;t want to call him a king or just an idea of what he &apos;s going to happen .
so they were able to give him the most of their favorite titles , most of the most tragic titles .
and this title . &quot;
UNK  , meeting , and they didn &apos;t have any previous titles .
the same jury means that the jury is the same .
and the central committee of the central status of the central status of the central status quo . &quot;
occasionally , there may be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of government , but it &apos;s a really bad title .
and that &apos;s why the senate is the senate .
they say , &quot; well , you can &apos;t call it .
and this guy still signed up with the treaties .
who &apos;s going to take this seriously , if he &apos;s just a little silly little star , like the united states , who has the united states of the united nations and the united states ?
after the last three weeks , there &apos;s no senate .
as an alternative , they agreed to say , &quot; yes , but they &apos;re definitely not going to be sure that they &apos;re not worthy of the title of the country , whether it &apos;s not a democrat , whether or not or not the republican national security council or not the chief of justice .
now , from the story of the three things that are interesting .
well , first of all , i like , i &apos;ve been able to find all the way that i could find the president of the former president of the obama .
barack obama , &quot; president obama &apos;s wife , &quot; obama &apos;s still waiting for the senate , just waiting for the senate .
and the second thing you know about the u.s. government , it &apos;s just temporary use -- it &apos;s going to happen .
but the third thing is that you can understand , and it &apos;s important , and i want you to remember that i want you to remember this , and that &apos;s what we want to remember the united states , and the united states has never heard of the united and the united states , right ?
it &apos;s about 5,000 amputees , many of the military control of the largest economy in the world , and also the largest economy in the world .
the reality of history and this is a noble path .
so the end of the senate .
they get their title .
and the other thing is that the other thing -- that sounds ridiculous title -- sounds weird -- that sounds weird , sounds weird .
but now , you know how many countries are there ?
a  UNK  .
it &apos;s because they wanted to make it sounds like a thousand -- all of those guys who have had all over 5,000 .
so at the end , the case of the representatives of the representatives of the house , because they were told that the president of the federal government .
and this is an important lesson that i think is that i &apos;ve learned , and i want to leave you .
politicians choose to control their words , and using words to control the reality of the words , but actually change the reality is far more than words .
thank you very much .
i was a battle that i was going to go to the truck , and i was 19 years old , and i was a  UNK  of  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
i had a black  UNK  tank in black , and i put a pair of sandals and a sort of sandals .
this is my first time .
early on , i grew up in a friend of mine , watching the war on saturday , watching the fight against racism and discrimination , and the nationalism of the people who were in the gulf of mexico , and i don &apos;t even know what it means , &quot; and it means that the  UNK  of  UNK  .
but that &apos;s the self .
so i &apos;m standing here today in afghanistan today , and the  UNK  of god , and i was an atheist and an artist who worked in afghanistan , and in the past afghanistan , and in the past nine years .
in afghanistan , you can create a lot of art , but i think there &apos;s a lot of things that i don &apos;t want to be able to make a difference in the world .
i wanted to be an old molecule in a day of his life , and he had become a popular singers , and he had become a threat to its own .
these guys who were going to take a vote for the election , i picked up the election , i was a fight .
i tried to use a gang member of the gang members of the country .
i want to take a look at a place called &quot;  UNK  , and look at a model of afghanistan , and see the police officers taser 86 percent of the police car , and then they stop the police officer , and then they give the money to the military police department , and they want to get paid for a bribe in kabul .
i want to know that i &apos;m going to use a conflict of afghanistan .
the war and how to do we create this kind of  UNK  , and the environment that we can only be used to be able to do with a  UNK  fashion , and so i had to add a new fashion , and i add a new standard in traditional fashion .
and i also wanted to put a  UNK  in kabul and a half of the world &apos;s war on the wall of the wall of the art of the wall of the  UNK  of the white collar of the white collar of the white  UNK  , and even if they &apos;re trying to make a white piece of paper .
but what you &apos;re doing is that they might be punished .
but i had to do have to do something because i wanted to do demand .
and that &apos;s my burden .
thank you .
hi , cameron russell , cameron russell , and i was a model .
well , i did 10 years .
now , i feel like this in a room , because i am not wearing this dress .
and i had another set .
this is the ted stage for the first time , so i think it &apos;s very lucky .
and if i don &apos;t feel like panic now , i don &apos;t have to tell you that i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;d like to tell you that i &apos;m going to be able to change in my mind .
it &apos;s not all everyone .
and this is good news , and i &apos;m not going to be good news .
the worst-case scenarios that i &apos;ve got to break this , because i &apos;m smiling muscles going to laugh .
you can .
so , why do i do this ?
this is strange .
well , i don &apos;t like this .
it &apos;s powerful with images , but it &apos;s also a very powerful image .
i &apos;m just in six seconds , and i &apos;m going to change your mind .
in this picture , in fact , in my boyfriend .
when i &apos;m going to touch the photographer , i was very comfortable with my hair .
i &apos;m sure , except for two days ago , except for two days ago , i couldn &apos;t really change the appearance of the appearance of a fixed period of time .
so today , i &apos;m going to be honest .
i &apos;m standing here today because i &apos;m a model .
i was on this stage because i was a beautiful woman , and we have a woman called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i &apos;m going to ask people to ask the questions that i &apos;m going to be honest .
the first question is , how do you model ?
i always say , &quot; well , i was discovered , but it &apos;s also what it means .
and the reason i became really became a really good reason , i am my legacy .
well , in the past few centuries , we &apos;re just in the last few centuries , not only young , but only in the way we &apos;re looking at the body of size , including the  UNK  ,  UNK  , the characteristic of women .
that &apos;s my legacy , that &apos;s my heritage , and that &apos;s my heritage .
i know some of you may have this idea that some of you may have some of the things that happen , like , for example ,  UNK  .
first of all , i &apos;m going to give you the impression of the world .
unfortunately , i &apos;m at nyu , i &apos;m going to tell you the story of nyu willing to take a model of nyu willing to take a four percentage of college graduates in the middle of the white  UNK  , which is only four 27 percent of the white folks are in the white .
the next question i asked people , &quot; is i grew up with models ? &quot;
my first answer is : &quot; i don &apos;t know , because i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing . &quot;
but the second answer is , i want to ask the question , &quot; why ? &quot;
you know what ? you can choose anything .
you can become the president of the united states , or the internet , a great poet , because it &apos;s a good poet , because you &apos;re the first one .
if you hear them , they said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t want to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; please . &quot;
because i couldn &apos;t make any decision , you can become the director of the editor-in-chief of m &amp; amp ; m &amp; amp ; quot ; m &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and you want to grow up when you grow up , you want to say , you want to win .
it can &apos;t be a model . it &apos;s a great model .
i &apos;m going to show you models that i &apos;m going to show you , because it &apos;s not like a big , because it will be a poet  UNK  .
so if photographer , the light photographer here , the lights -- like , let &apos;s say , &quot; wow , my clients , &quot; i want to take a long picture , and then i want to take a finish line , just take a finish line , if you want to take the three quarters of the wall , you go back up to the front of your hand .
it looks like this .
it doesn &apos;t look at that .
i don &apos;t know how this is going on .
the reality is , when you graduate , you have multiple jobs , you &apos;ve done , and you can &apos;t be the president of the united states , but if you want to be the u.s. president of the united states , you know , and you &apos;re going to be watching your experience .
the next question is , &quot; is the question : &quot; are they ? &quot;
it &apos;s a fraction of them , but it &apos;s just a little bit of work .
this is the first model i was the first time that i had ever had before .
i know that &apos;s kind of personal , but i was very young .
this is a picture i took a couple of months ago .
this is a picture that day .
i was with friends .
this is a picture i took a couple of days ago in france .
this is a picture of my football team .
this is my current .
i want you to understand that these are not pictures .
it was a group of photographers , a group of photographers ,  UNK  , and the photographer , and the  UNK  , and they also have a map of the  UNK  .
the next question is , &quot; can you get free ? &quot;
i had no opportunity to wear eight inches in high school , but i don &apos;t want to talk about the real world .
i was in cambridge , and i walked into a store and walked into the store .
when i was with my friends , i was a terrible driver , she was a bust , and she said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry about the road , &quot; excuse me , we &apos;re riding on the road . &quot;
and i get that because i &apos;m not the appearance of me .
i lived in new york , there was 14 percent of young black men and women were young black men .
and in new york in new york , there were only 17 million people in new york , so i &apos;m going to have a stop sign : &quot; are i &apos;m going to be dead ? &quot;
it &apos;s a couple of times ?
and i found that in this talk , when i was 13 years old in the u.s. , they didn &apos;t like 17 percent .
so the last question is , &quot; what is model ? &quot;
i guess what they would expect , if you want to be a little bit of weight , and you will be happy .
and when the answer is , we &apos;ll give you a answer .
and we said , &quot; travel everywhere , traveling and creative inspiration , wonderful inspiration , wonderful work together . &quot;
it &apos;s only half of the fact that half of the lens , because we never would say , &quot; i &apos;ll never say , &quot; i &apos;m not going to be safe . &quot;
because i have to worry about every day .
if you ever want to be , if i had a better hair , and i &apos;m happier ?
and if you look at models , you know , because they have the most beautiful weight of their hair , and they may be the most beautiful woman in the world .
so when i was going to talk about this , i realized that it &apos;s hard to find a place for me , because if i &apos;m standing here , i &apos;m going to be able to look at the heart , i &apos;m not comfortable with that , but if i &apos;m not comfortable with this .
but the most difficult thing is that the most difficult to show you , because i &apos;m the biggest of the people .
but i &apos;m also very happy with respect , and i was standing up here in front of me , and i &apos;m not talking about 10 or 20 , 30 or 40 years ago , and the most important thing is that the most important thing is going to be possible because i &apos;m not going to be able to pay attention to the college tuition .
and if this talk , you will benefit , i hope that we &apos;ll be able to get a sense of what we &apos;re trying to understand the success of what we can understand .
thank you .
one of the things i want to do today .
don &apos;t let me be normal .
i want to introduce you two brothers to two brothers .
it &apos;s 22 years old .
he doesn &apos;t talk , but he &apos;s very much more enjoyment in his best way .
you know what is love .
he shares unconditional love him .
he didn &apos;t care about what he didn &apos;t care .
he doesn &apos;t mean , there &apos;s no way .
when he was singing the song that we didn &apos;t even know when i was reminded that i was reminded of them that i was so fascinating .
it &apos;s 16 years old , and it &apos;s hot .
he had the extraordinary skills .
but this is what we have selective breeding .
he didn &apos;t remember his chocolate , but i remember the year of my ipod , and he was four years old , and he was four years old , and i was able to get the lady gaga salads .
sounds fantastic ?
but a lot of people don &apos;t think .
the fact is , because they don &apos;t define their own definition of human mind , they &apos;re often misunderstood .
but let me know that even if they &apos;re normal reality , even if they look at the normal level of autism .
you know , some of you may not know , &quot; well , it &apos;s a complex disorder , and it &apos;s complex and social brain disorders .
every case , every case is a particular case , so sam is different .
in every single case , 20 minutes , and there &apos;s a new disease burden of disease , which is one of the disease , but one of the causes of the disease .
i know , &quot; well , i know , &quot; well , i &apos;ve had a date , &quot; i am nothing . &quot;
i was three , my brother was very excited when i was born .
and after a few months , i realized that he was very different .
he &apos;s scream .
he wasn &apos;t willing to play a little bit like that , he was interested in that .
he &apos;s tapped himself in the world , he uses his own version of himself , he &apos;s looking for the joy of things that he looks looking for the rest of his life , he looks at the washing machine and his machine .
and when he grew up , he became more unique .
except for fact , often frustrated , he &apos;s frustrated with  UNK  , and he doesn &apos;t have  UNK  , he doesn &apos;t look at the world .
it &apos;s too simple .
i couldn &apos;t deny my life that i had been trying to do with them .
but i &apos;m going to think about the things that i &apos;ve talked about the things that i don &apos;t want to realize that i &apos;m not going to be normal . &quot;
it &apos;s a difference between the normal variation of the difference between the person who doesn &apos;t mean .
it &apos;s just a different kind of different species .
i just want to say , &quot; sam  UNK  , you don &apos;t have to have to be normal . &quot;
you can be extraordinary .
there is something that has been a lot of variation in each of us has to be honest with each other . &quot;
the likelihood of progress of progress is that we &apos;re thinking about the possibility of reaching other people .
please don &apos;t say , &quot; please . &quot;
thank you .
dr.  UNK   UNK  with a bullet in a doctor , and we &apos;ve got caught in a  UNK  , and the only one in seconds .
but now , 50 million times , we can get a million times a million times a million times more or less than a million times , in a million times , a million or in the world .
now i &apos;m going to show you a new kind of technology called  UNK  , which is so fast that it &apos;s so fast .
so with this technology , we can see the light that can see if we can see the light , and we can see the camera or can see the camera that we can see the face of our body .
now , if i use a laser pointer , and i &apos;m one of the  UNK  -- one of the  UNK  -- that &apos;s a  UNK  , which is just like a few seconds , which is just like a bullet , which is just like a million times faster than the speed of light .
now , if you put this into a beam of light , what happens in the bottle , right ?
what &apos;s in slow motion ?
now , the whole thing is .
now , remember , please remember , this whole thing is that this whole thing happened in the entire  UNK  , which is a million times a million times , but i &apos;m going to show you a million times a million times a million times a million times the light .
but coke &apos;s not funded this .
now , there &apos;s a lot of things happen , so i &apos;m going to show .
now , the bottle enters the bottle , which is the bullet that we &apos;re running through the bottle .
some of them came out , and so you start to see the table .
and many of them ended up with the bottle caps .
you can see , there &apos;s a air , it &apos;s bouncing off .
and at the same time , the table , because at the top of the table , and you see the bottom , and you see the bottom .
now , if you &apos;re going to take a quick video of the same way , you know , you know , you know , how long would you have to look at this long time ?
one week , a week , actually a year .
and of course , it &apos;s very boring .
but what is it still ?
you can see the waves there , the other side of the wall and the wall .
it &apos;s like a rock in a stone .
and i think this is how to make a  UNK  , which is , of course , we see , but of course , we see the holistic .
but if you look at this in the tomato , you &apos;ll notice , you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s not going to see it .
why ? well , it &apos;s used to be one of the tens of millions of  UNK  .
so , in the future , in the future , you don &apos;t use your mobile phone , you don &apos;t have to check if you don &apos;t have any fruit .
so , what is my team at mit ?
now , as a photographer , you know , if you &apos;re trying to get a little bit of light , you need a million times a million times faster , so you can &apos;t get a million times faster .
so , what we do is that , and we &apos;ve got all these photons and all over 100 times , all over the same time , all the way , and we have a couple of years ago , and this is what we &apos;re seeing here .
and when we put all of raw data , it &apos;s interesting to deal with it .
now , superman is now .
some other heroes can imagine the hero of the future , but he can see the future .
and that &apos;s the principle we can get to the door .
these light will come into the room , and some lights go back into the room , and then we can use these cameras .
it &apos;s not the real time .
on the left , you see the  UNK  camera .
there &apos;s a wall behind the wall , we &apos;ll take this off .
so , in the conclusion that we published in nature , &quot; and it &apos;s called &quot; natural  UNK  .
the music we &apos;re going to launch these light , and they &apos;re going to hit the light , which is the light of the ray of light , and some of the light that falls , and we know that it &apos;s going to be part of the light , and it &apos;s a little bit of light , but it &apos;s going to be part of the light , and they &apos;re going to return to the light .
it &apos;s because we have the capability of the music that we can run so fast that we have the  UNK  , and we have this special  UNK  .
it has a good time to catch the speed of light at the speed of light .
so , we don &apos;t just know about the camera is not only hiding distances from the distance , but we don &apos;t know where the distance is .
it &apos;s a laser beam of light , and we can see that we can see the pictures of the screen , but you see the meaning of the screen , but we can see a lot of light , and then we can see it , and we can see it , and then we can see it ?
so what can we look at a barking .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
now , we can see the music that we can now live in their lives , and we &apos;re going to be able to go to the future , but we can see it in the future , and we can see it , and we can see the survivors , because we can look at the window , because we can see the window that we &apos;re looking at the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart attacks .
but of course , because of course , the blood , it &apos;s hard to do , so we call the  UNK   UNK   UNK  , which is a really big question , as a medical model of health .
now , like dr. love , dr. love science , a scientist became a scientist , and i realized that science , and i realize that every time i realized that every science is not only a lot of science , and it &apos;s just a new technology , and we can see it is that , and just one of these things that we &apos;ve been able to remember , just one of these two seconds .
but some interesting things are happening .
and when you see the lid closes down , they &apos;re moving away from us .
but it should be moving around .
what happened ?
it turns out , because we &apos;re approaching the speed of light , and we have some weird anomaly , and we &apos;ll see these images .
what happens is happening is happening in the sequence of events , so it &apos;s time to warps space and space .
so no matter whether it &apos;s going to see the next generation , or the next generation , or we &apos;ve invented the data , we &apos;ve invented all the details of the details , and we put all the details on the details , and we &apos;re going to start thinking about the diy satellites , and we &apos;re going to be able to look at the other dimension .
thank you . thank you .
this is where i live in kenya , in kenya , in nairobi .
in behind me behind my father behind the cows in nairobi .
in nairobi national parks national parks , and it doesn &apos;t mean by the fence , like this , which means freedom to move around the outside of the park .
so like this predator looks like this predator , and that &apos;s what they do .
they killed our livestock .
and that &apos;s one of the night before the cows woke up in the morning , and i found that i was in my morning , because i woke up in my house , because i was the only home .
and we believe that the human beings we believe that we can take home from the heavens and hells and heavens .
so i gradually became increasingly terrified .
they were both livestock and protect our family and the livestock and the same question , but they were frustrated .
so they decided to kill lions .
this is a sanctuary in nairobi in nairobi in nairobi .
and i think that &apos;s the park in nairobi .
we were at six or seven eight year-old boy , who was nine years old , and they were responsible for my career .
so i had to find a solution to problem .
i think about the first way to use fire , because i knew i was terrified .
but i realized what was that i didn &apos;t have any good results , and we were able to see what we &apos;re doing .
but i didn &apos;t give up .
so there &apos;s a second way to use .
i want to be a lion of  UNK  , and i &apos;m standing next to  UNK  .
but it &apos;s very smart .
and the first day they saw , and they go back to the next day . and they will say , &quot; and he &apos;d never been here .
so they were killing animals .
and one night , i was walking around the house , and i was walking around the house .
and i began to realize that the lions are scared of light .
so i got an idea .
because i was a little kid , i could just walk around the house , and i was able to do something that i was in my house , and i almost killed her , and i almost killed a lot about a lot about it .
so i found an old  UNK  ,  UNK  pointer that &apos;s used to be a little motorbike bag , from a little motorbike helmets to control .
and i found a switch on a light switch on lights .
the light bulb came from a built-in flashlight .
everything is ready .
as you can see , the solar cells are detected by solar cells , and i &apos;ll give you the battery power of battery power to the battery power of the battery . &quot;
this will be  UNK  .
you can see , the light bulb , because the lion is coming from a lion .
and when you look at the lion of the lions .
the lights attract lions out of the lions around the house , and i think they &apos;re living in a  UNK  , but actually i was doing myself .
thank you . thank you .
i was in two years ago , and i spent two years ago , and i had no offspring .
my neighbors all heard about people .
one of them is a grandmother .
and she had a whole bunch of lions , and she asked her if she had a whole bunch of her house .
i was  UNK  .
and so , you can see the lights behind the curtain .
so far , i &apos;ve been working for the rest of my family , and it &apos;s very useful .
now , my approach is being used to kenya , and the animal kingdom of kenya , and the animal kingdom , like the elephants , and they &apos;re getting away from the human population .
and i was fortunate enough to invent this , because it was the best school in kenya -- and i was very excited about this .
my new school is now , and i joined it and help me raise awareness .
i even took my friends back to my community , and i was able to help them .
a year ago , i was just a year ago in the savanna , and i was looking at the average , and i was looking at a day .
today , i did that .
i got a chance to get an opportunity for the first time .
so i was a great dream : when i grew up , i became a pilot .
and i hate lions , but now , because i &apos;ve invented the lions , and my dad , and i was finally able to save a lion .
thank you very much .
thank you , chris anderson , you don &apos;t believe .
so you &apos;ve got this scholarship . richard  UNK  .
so , are you going to be inventing ?
what is your next step ?
UNK  : the next invention of my next invention , i want to make a fence .
UNK  : i know , i &apos;ve got the fence line , but i wanted to do myself .
you &apos;ve been trying to do something , but you &apos;ve been trying to stop -- i tried to stop , but i tried to stop .
it would be a very richard  UNK  . richard  UNK  .
we &apos;re going to grow up in your friends .
thank you very much . thank you .
i live in los angeles .
this is  UNK  : a hotel restaurant in los angeles , restaurants .
so what the urban planners are at the intersection of the city of los angeles , and the name of los angeles , and they &apos;re going to be in los angeles , and they &apos;re going to solve this problem .
this is south los angeles .
UNK  hotels , restaurants all around the house .
and other half million people are living in the united states , and i grew up in los angeles .
it &apos;s interesting .
people died in los angeles .
for example , i &apos;m living in my neighborhood , and i &apos;m going to be 10 miles , and we can &apos;t find eight times more than eight .
i &apos;m tired of reality .
and at the same time , if you don &apos;t have to think about food , what if you look at the food system , you see what you &apos;re looking at the food system , what are you feeling ?
i saw the same as a car .
i saw like the center of starbucks .
i can &apos;t think it again .
and i think the answer is that there &apos;s a problem .
food is a problem , food solution .
and i &apos;m going to get tired of 45 minutes to get the apple of 45 minutes .
so what i did was , i was in my house .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
150 ft .
and the government is moving .
but anyone needs to maintain it .
so i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s my responsibility , i must preserve it , and i thought , &quot; what i would do . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i need it .
so my team and i went to l.a. , &quot; we began to grow our own food , and we start to grow food , and there was nine .
we &apos;re a free of freedom , from a different city , and they &apos;re all of volunteers .
it &apos;s beautiful .
but soon someone complained .
i blame the government , i had to remove the garden of  UNK  , i had to remove the  UNK  .
i thought , &quot; what is it ?
before it was a little bit of food , and nobody cared .
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s cool . &quot;
because it &apos;s nothing .
so the times of the times the l.a. times of los angeles , and the story of the members of the community and the members of the members of the gang members of the gang members of the  UNK  , and we managed to collect success .
we use our hands .
and he went to visit , and he loves to express what we &apos;re doing .
i mean , of course , how do they do that ?
the number of the open spaces in the united states .
it has a cost of 26 square kilometers .
that &apos;s a central park .
there are enough to be enough to have adequate supplies .
why is they really bad ?
a tree can get a tree , even a tree .
one dollar for a dollar , you can bring 75 dollars .
this is my faith , i tell people that i tell you that people are growing .
it &apos;s kind of like food .
now , lo and behold , i was in los angeles .
i grew up there , and i grew up there .
i refuse to be rejected by myself . i &apos;m going to create this reality .
you see , i &apos;m an artist .
gardening is my job , art , creating art .
it &apos;s like a graffiti artist , and i &apos;m a  UNK  .
i think as a canvas and a canvas , and the trees are grasses of the trees .
you might be shocked to be a canvas , if you treat your canvas .
you can &apos;t imagine how powerful sunflowers , and how it affects the way .
what will happen ?
i saw the garden of my education , and i became a tool to become a tool .
to change the communities , you have to change the soil .
we are .
you &apos;re going to be shocked by the way .
gardening is the most challenging health activity of the most challenging activities , especially in the city .
you add a strawberry tree .
when i came up with my mom and dad came up with my mom and 10 : 30 a.m. , when my daughter came up with me , and when i saw it , they had a very embarrassment of them .
and they felt that i was very bad , and they told me that you don &apos;t have to tell them .
this is the reason for the street .
and when i saw people around me , i think it &apos;s very , i think it &apos;s a very difficult thing to do . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , of course , i &apos;m not afraid of people will steal .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the streets .
that &apos;s what i want .
i want people to take it , but i want to be healthy , and i want to be healthy . &quot;
and there was a homeless man in downtown los angeles , a homeless man .
these guys are helping me .
and that &apos;s cool about how they create a garden about how they affect their mothers and their own mothers and their own stories , and how they can change their own story , and just to see them , just for a moment .
green spaces may be a green garden .
we &apos;ve got about 50 people involved in this team , and we were all volunteers .
if the kids grow up eating chips .
and if they grow them .
but when these kids don &apos;t see them in front of their eyes , and if they don &apos;t have a impact on their bodies and how to eat them , and they &apos;re eating their food .
and i see young people want to work , but they &apos;re very happy to see it , and i &apos;d love to see them differently , and i &apos;ve been trying to see the road , and they were designed for other people .
when i was gardening classes , i found that i was able to take over time to take over the community .
and when we do that , we know who will .
well , george washington ? george washington .
but if we don &apos;t change the soil , we will never do this .
it &apos;s my plan right now . this is what i want to do .
i &apos;d like to be able to share this whole block of food .
i want to reinvent the wheel .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
i don &apos;t think free , because it &apos;s free .
and the beauty of sustainability is that you have to sustain it .
so what i &apos;m talking about is to people , and that &apos;s what people get away from their children to grow their own food , to know their own food , the honor and honor to honor their glory and honor to honor the market .
so what i want to do is i want to make it more appealing .
i want to be a revolution in a traitor to rogue .
we &apos;re going to be a rogue .
if you &apos;re not a fan , that &apos;s not a rogue .
picks up a rogue ?
let &apos;s be your choice .
and if i want you to meet , if i want to meet you , if i want to meet somebody sitting on the chair of your chair .
if i want to meet the garden , i want to meet the garden .
so , thank you . thank you .
thank you . thank you .
2011 , i was three months ago , i was  UNK  in new york city .
we  UNK  .
we &apos;re in the house , pitch black , black , not to keep us warm up the sun .
we help make a better model ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , a better  UNK  ,  UNK  , and it &apos;s impossible to make a splash , and we may not have been a lot of artists , but we &apos;re actually enjoying a brilliant artist .
in 2011 , 2011 , as the global community , as i see the tragedy of japan .
and soon after i was doing a volunteer organization in a volunteer organization , and the team of volunteers , just within a few days .
i was volunteers , and i couldn &apos;t wait a couple of volunteers .
five months later , i went to japan , and i came to japan .
it was a japanese little fishing village , a little fishing village , only about five million people , which was the first place in the first place .
over the course of the tsunami at the time of the tsunami , two miles of an inland seas .
you can imagine this town .
we canal  UNK  and canal and canal and water .
we help schools and homes were destroyed by the houses and cleaned up the house .
we stink of a lot of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , the fish , the factory of the fish , the factory .
we also ourselves are getting dirty , but we &apos;re very  UNK  ourselves .
and a couple of weeks , volunteers and the local residents of volunteers .
they found that they were caught in their cameras and  UNK  .
everybody &apos;s acting like this .
they collect these pictures and collect them into the town .
until now , i realized that i had lost these images of consciousness .
when they were attacked , they were able to travel , you know , after the tsunami , they had to move everything else .
so i spent the last week in japan , i found myself in a few days in a  UNK  center .
it &apos;s getting a huge amount of  UNK  .
it happened to be the local center of the local people .
people collecting the photo taken from the communality , which i was fortunate enough , and i was fortunate enough , and i started to give them , and i started to get the picture .
those moments are very touched , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very creative , and i was really struck by the way , and i was really called &quot; innovation . &quot;
when i looked at the photos of the past hundred years , i &apos;ve got kicked out of a hundred years in my lab , and i think it might be able to help me think about it , and maybe help them think of them , and maybe , and i can help them recognize them .
so , i went on the day , and i asked them to go to the next day after the morning , and they said , &quot; you know , and they said , &quot; well , i know , we should know .
and so we started doing it .
this was a first time ago .
it &apos;s not very serious enough , but it &apos;s not been very significant enough to be able to do this picture , and we had to fix it .
otherwise , she wouldn &apos;t look like her face , she wouldn &apos;t look like a tragedy , and she would destroy her face .
and over time , as we need more and more and more photos , and we need more help to deal with that , and we need to deal with the help of them , and i &apos;m looking for the help of them .
within two weeks , i got 150 volunteers , and they were willing to join us .
so , in july , in japan , and we ended up in japan .
every week , we raised beds in the temporary installation , people came up to their temporary installation .
sometimes , some of the elderly lady in a scanner , and women have found that they could have lost their 10 minutes later , they can give us a picture , and then we can actually upload them to the cloud , and then they may be able to get a picture of the cloud , and then they may have come from japan , and they may have been able to have seen before .
but at that time , they were able to take a picture of the forms of time .
it could be possible for an hour , and it might be possible .
even months .
in the beautiful picture , you have to have to deal with a little bit of different colors , the color of the water , and the colors of water , and the detail of the water .
it &apos;s a whole lot of time .
all of the effects of the tsunami , the effects of desalination brine .
and if you don &apos;t clean enough , we don &apos;t have enough to fix them , we have to fix them .
we &apos;re going to clean .
there was a local woman .
these are very easily shot .
and as i said , as the captain of the people who have tattoos .
you can &apos;t have any kind of mess .
and the woman gave us a very lucky woman .
she started to washing her hands , and she realizes that she didn &apos;t realize that she had even more damage to her .
well , she had a backup plan .
otherwise , she had a picture of her face , and she couldn &apos;t fully recover all the images of him .
and when she came from here , we took some pictures to share with some images of the story .
her husband is actually a picture of her husband , and she found that her husband had found out of the local army that she pulled out of the town , and he was actually very far away .
the tsunami of tsunami , he was preparing for the tsunami , he was in the wake of the tsunami .
the tsunami hit the tsunami , he had to get the front lines .
she had two sons , although she had two different schools .
one of them had been hit by a tsunami .
she took a week to get back to the family at the time .
and we went back to the day , and she was 14 , and she was 14 .
it &apos;s a tragedy for her , despite the tragedy of the tragedy of catastrophe , and he gave him the best gift of life , and he was able to go back to a picture of  UNK  , and that was no longer alive , and when he left his life is not worthy of life .
in japan , six months later in japan , six months later , volunteer readers , a hundred thousand volunteers , a hundred thousand volunteers .
most of the people who returned to the hand , and it &apos;s important .
over the global volunteers , we got 90 volunteers to get back to 90 percent of the entire world .
in this case , we don &apos;t have a lot of material , most of course , most of the ink is done .
we take a picture .
it &apos;s a reminder that remind us that some of the things that remind us of something that we have a place .
they &apos;re helping us to keep track and remember the images of the past , but we &apos;re the most easily deceived .
this is the project that &apos;s all of the human nature of the human nature of the past .
and when you look at this picture , it would bring back to life , it would bring back to life .
and this project has brought us a lot to change .
some of them have experienced before , and they built a little bit more than a model , for example , a model for example , which is not only possible to have a perfect model .
i &apos;d like to give you an email that i received an email , and i was from about six months later , i was from japan .
when i was thinking about the images of the photographs , and i think of the story , and the stories of the story .
and one of them is touched by a woman in my grandmother , a lady in the midst of a small child , and this little girl , because this woman had a baby in my house , because my mother had a picture of my grandmother , my mother and my daughter &apos;s daughter , and my mother had a daughter of my daughter in my home .
throughout the world , across the globe , and we have some basic requirements , are the basic requirements of the world ? &quot;
thank you .
today , i &apos;d like to talk to you today , the same question .
i &apos;m going to talk about domestic violence , and i &apos;m going to answer this question , &quot; why is it ? &quot;
&quot; how would someone like to live with her life ? &quot;
i &apos;m not a psychiatrist . i &apos;m not a psychiatrist .
i just have a personal experience of women .
i was 22 years old at 22 , at harvard university .
i moved to new york , i moved to new york , and when i started to edit the editor of the editors .
i had my first apartment in my house .
and that &apos;s the secret of my life , i think it &apos;s a gun that i used to  UNK  the gun , and pointed out to the gun .
and i was the most favorite shot of people , and i was pointing at the first time , and i fell in my head .
now , i tell the story of love , &quot; is a romantic love , &quot; is a romantic love of a story , and even millions of women , including men and women , including men and women .
maybe it &apos;s happening .
i don &apos;t look like domestic violence .
i had a bachelor &apos;s degree of education , and i got a bachelor &apos;s degree mba .
and most of the time for most of the company , including the washington post office , including the washington post .
i married 20 years ago , my husband &apos;s 20 years old .
UNK  a star pupil in labrador , labrador , a  UNK  .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to tell you about the fact that the first person is probably the first one of the racial discrimination of ethnic and income .
it &apos;s everywhere .
the second thing i &apos;m going to say is that a lot of domestic violence , women should be on women &apos;s issues .
not .
over 85 percent of men and women who are sexual intimacy , not only in other words , domestic violence , in other words , in other words , in other words , in other words , domestic violence , or the most violent offenders , which is why it &apos;s the most violent or violence .
i thought that the world would have only one person in the world , and i &apos;m going to stay around me .
i was 22 years old , and i was 16 to eight years old age , compared to the age of 16 .
i &apos;m a typical victim of a typical victim , because i don &apos;t know about domestic violence .
i was at a time i met in  UNK  , and it was very cold .
we happen in new york on the subway in new york , and i &apos;ll talk to him .
he tells me two things .
and the first one of his graduate school , and he was a very good job at a wall street .
but the first time i met him for the first time to meet his humor , and he looks like a boy , and he looks like a boy .
he had the same kind of like a wheat field of wheat , and the wheat , and it looks like a  UNK  .
at the first time , the most smart thing that i &apos;m really smart , and i believe that i am a strong .
and especially when he started his colleagues , he &apos;s a hero .
we start with him , and i like , for instance , i like , for example , i &apos;m going to be smart , and i went to harvard , and my teenage jobs .
he wanted to know that my family , my childhood dream and my childhood .
i had trust , i &apos;m a woman , as a woman before i had never been before .
by the way he tells us that he had a little unknown , and he made me realize that he had been inspired by four years ago , and he was four years old , and he had been  UNK  , who had been so many of them , he had to be so smart , he was very smart , very smart .
and that &apos;s why the college degree of college degrees , and the light of the future .
if someone told me that this guy is smart , humor , and i love , and i would love to tell you whether i &apos;d be able to make up my work , and i &apos;m going to be able to make friends and who work , and i &apos;m going to be able to make a little bit more violent or less violent , because i &apos;m going to be able to make a little bit more violent or less violent or less violent .
and i didn &apos;t know that the victim and domestic violence is beginning .
i didn &apos;t know the second step .
i &apos;m not going to go back home , and i said , &quot; hey , i &apos;m going to be great , but i &apos;m going to go into your neighbor . &quot;
the fact is that the fact that night he went back home , and he told me that he quit his job , he quit his job , and he quit his job , and he had to quit his job , and i was able to leave him alone .
now , i didn &apos;t want to do want to go to new york , but i wanted to work , but i wanted to make my job .
i thought i was crazy , love , and i didn &apos;t know that romantic love , i &apos;ve been walking into the heart of your body .
domestic violence is the threat of violence .
that &apos;s the gun i just took out .
and we moved to new england -- i think it &apos;s safe , and i think it &apos;s safe .
you put a car in a car .
put a bed in the bed , underneath the pillow .
he said that when he had a little gun .
to make him feel safe .
and the gun went down to a gun , although he did not take a gun , he pointed out at the edge of the gun at the edge of the edges .
the first time i was five days before i was five days ago .
that &apos;s seven o &apos;clock in the morning .
i was working on the computer , and i was trying to get my work , and i was kind of frustration with my bare hands , and i couldn &apos;t breath out of my neck .
after five days , 10 , five fingers crossed my fingers crossed my neck .
and even though the things that happened , i believe that we can live in life , because we live .
he was able to do that .
he &apos;s just a wedding day , but i was planning to get a handle of his family .
this is an accident , and he won &apos;t hurt me anymore .
and i played twice .
for the first time , i went searching for the first time , and he was sitting in front seat , and he &apos;s driving the seat in front seat , and i was driving the seat in front seat .
UNK  ,  UNK  drive home , and he &apos;s driving home , and he &apos;s standing in his face , and he was cold .
i &apos;ve been doing two and a half years ago , and i &apos;ve been beaten up twice a week .
i &apos;ve had one of my stupid man .
in fact , every three women in the united states , domestic violence is a victim of domestic violence , and the potential of domestic abuse , and a half million children .
so , in fact , i wasn &apos;t actually .
back to my question : why do i stay ?
the answer is simple .
i didn &apos;t know him .
even though he was carrying a lock me up and he pointed out to me , and i &apos;m going to get rid of the dog , and i &apos;m going to get rid of the keys , and i had never thought about myself before .
the opposite , i was a woman who was very deeply unsettled millions of men and women , and i was the only man in the world , and that &apos;s the only person in the world .
you all want to ask the other question , why don &apos;t she leave it ?
why did i flee ? i have a lot of opportunity .
and for me , this is the most painful issue of people and suffering , but i can &apos;t understand how it is that we can &apos;t understand .
because in domestic violence is the last step of killing her .
70 percent of domestic violence is over 70 percent of the victims , after she died , because after she left .
the other results may have been tracking , including the victim , even after the victims ; they didn &apos;t cheat ; they didn &apos;t cheat the victim of family .
now we &apos;re still going to ask her , why not ?
and i decided to leave the last time , i was able to break the limits of what i could do .
and i realized that if i don &apos;t love this man , i would love to kill man .
so i silence .
and i asked everybody to go to the police , and my family , and my family , and i &apos;m standing here today , because i &apos;m standing here today , because everyone is helping me .
we tend to describe the victims of the  UNK  , women , like the women &apos;s terrible headline , like the headline .
&quot; why is she leaving this question ? &quot;
some people say , &quot; well , she said , &quot; she &apos;s wrong , &quot; and she was like the victims of a victim of his intent .
but the book &quot; came out of the book , and after the book , and i told them that story , and i want to tell them what they want to learn from their lives , and they start to be happy with their wives , happy , their wives , mothers and their wives , their mothers and fathers , the mothers who live happily ever from my wife .
in fact , i &apos;m typical of the victims , domestic violence is a typical survivor .
i was a kindness and kindness and a child again .
UNK  a star pupil in labrador , labrador , a  UNK  .
and i never would say , &quot; well , i &apos;ll never say , &quot; love my mouth , &quot; and he pointed at my head .
now , you might think , wow , this is amazing , &quot; wow , &quot; wow , &quot; wow , she &apos;s talking about , &quot; but in fact , i &apos;m talking about you .
i &apos;m sure , now i &apos;m talking to you , i &apos;m talking about some people who are being tortured or abused .
you &apos;re probably going to happen in your daughters , you are the best friends of your friends and your best friends .
i can end my own story of love . &quot;
i still have silence today .
and this is the way of helping victims , and i &apos;m going to ask you , and i asked you to ask your last request .
tell you what you &apos;re hearing today .
silence has to live in silence .
you have the ability to stop domestic violence .
we need to help each of us .
we need to understand that every single person is domestic violence .
your child , your child , your colleagues , your friends and family talking about this topic , and you will discuss the topic .
the survivors of the best survivor , and the future .
domestic violence is taking seriously harms and interventions , reduce the likelihood of intervention , the victims of a victim .
let &apos;s give us the bed , our beds , and we should be the oasis of peace and oasis .
thank you .
when i was a kid , i thought , i was the best country in the world , i &apos;ve learned to be a poem called &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i thought it was very proudly .
in school , we had a lot of time to learn from the outside history of the world , but we never know about the world , except in japan and korea , the united states and japan .
i &apos;ve also been wondering if i think outside the world , i thought i &apos;d spent all of the rest of my life .
when i was seven years old , i saw the first time , i saw that i was living in north korea .
i don &apos;t have a sense of poverty .
but in 1995 , my mom took me a letter from a letter to her sisters .
it says , &quot; when you read the book , you know , it &apos;s all five weeks ago , we were leaving all five weeks .
we &apos;re all lying on the floor , we &apos;re all dead .
i was shocked .
that &apos;s the first time i heard of people in my country .
after a train station , i was walking through a train station , i saw a train station .
a woman dying of a woman on the floor , holding her baby on the floor .
but nobody can help them , because they don &apos;t even have their own families .
in the mid- &apos; 90s . it was a terrible famine .
unfortunately , over a million north koreans died of starvation .
the more and more and more and more and less frequent  UNK  , and i became black , and the lights go through the river .
i often think about why they don &apos;t think about it .
this is a picture of a picture of the night sky .
this is a part of china and its border .
as you see , as you see , in some places that are very , very narrow , very narrow , narrow down to the road .
but a lot of people died .
sometimes i see the bodies in front of water .
i couldn &apos;t leave alone when i left north korea , but i can only tell you that it was the most difficult thing that i was sent to china .
and i thought , i was just a little bit of time .
but i didn &apos;t realize that i was 14 years ago .
in china , i was a little girl in china .
i don &apos;t know that as a refugee , i &apos;m going to be living in north korea , but i was very soon enough to realize that it was very dangerous , because even in china , even in china .
so i always wondered , i was scared of my life that i was scared of the people that i was sent to north korea .
one day , my worst nightmares , i had nightmares , and i had nightmares of the police officer .
i mean , my north koreans , so my native chinese , and i asked a question , and i asked a lot of questions .
i was very scared , and i was terrified of my heart .
if i had any kind of  UNK  , i would go back to jail .
i thought it was my life . i was still trying to make me worried about fear and fear .
and after this guy , the other guy who said , &quot; yes .
she &apos;s not north koreans .
and then they go to a miracle .
some north koreans died in china , but there were a lot of chinese were caught by the police .
these girls are lucky .
and they were caught , but they were caught by the international  UNK  .
but also , north koreans were lucky .
millions of tons of north koreans were arrested and sent back to china to north korea , north korea , and they were executed or executed .
and i was lucky enough to go out of north korea .
this is a miserable fact , that miserable north koreans have to survive , and that &apos;s just trying to survive .
even when they learn to find their jobs , they &apos;ve found themselves in the world .
that &apos;s why , after 10 years , i decided to take a risk of taking koreans , and i decided to start with new life .
and in korea , i was even harder to imagine .
and it &apos;s important to me , so i have to learn english -- i got to learn english language .
and also , i realized that south korea had a huge difference between north korea .
even though we are all of us , but we &apos;ve become very different .
i &apos;ve even experienced an identity .
am i a koreans ?
where am i going to come from ?
suddenly , i seemed to be able to call any country .
and although it &apos;s not easy to be able to get a small challenge .
the university of  UNK  .
and just before i got a new telephone , i got a phone call from a telephone .
UNK  sent me home , and i was sent to a punishment , and my family was forced to move from the countryside .
they have to get out of the way , so i &apos;ve got to escape .
north koreans are so free .
you want to go across north korea to south korea , and it &apos;s impossible , so i &apos;m going to be able to go to the east of china , and then i went to china .
because my family didn &apos;t understand chinese , so i don &apos;t know china , and i went into southeast asia .
we have a week on a bus for a week , almost a few times a week .
and again , we were on buses , and knocked on a bus .
he looked at everybody , and he starts to ask the question .
because my family was terrified , i didn &apos;t know that they were terrified .
so when china came up to the door of china , i stood up with my family , and he told me that he was a human stewards .
and he looked at me , but i was fortunate enough .
and so we went to the  UNK  , but i &apos;ve got to get my hands on the border .
and even though we had been arrested , and i had been arrested .
and i had a paid for a month , and after a month , my family was arrested , and then a month later , they were released , and then they were released .
that &apos;s one of my life of my life .
and i was able to get the freedom of information that i was able to get out of jail .
i was overwhelmed with the police and the municipal police and despair , and hopelessness , and i tried to save them , but i would save them .
i was  UNK  .
and so , i hear a question , &quot; how did i hear ? &quot;
i was a surprise that strangers are completely innocent stranger .
and i &apos;m going to explain to the people in the english dictionary , and the rest of the person who had no money to go out to the other two families and the rest of my family had come out of the town .
and i really thank him , and he said , &quot; why do you want to help me ? &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m not going to help him . &quot;
&quot; i was helping north korea . &quot;
and i realized that it was a very symbolic moment .
the kindness of kindness of strangers are the most symbols of north koreans , and i want to understand that strangers are supportive of strangers , and i think we need to need to be an international north koreans .
finally , in the end , i went to travel , and i was finally able to be able to meet the war , but only half a war .
many of north koreans , and their families , and when they come into the country , they usually don &apos;t have money .
so we can teach the international community to educate ourselves , education , teaching english , and so on .
we can also live in the world as a bridge between north korea and north korea , because we all live in north korea and north korea , and north korea , and we were able to go back to north korea .
i was so lucky enough , in my life , so i &apos;ve got to help , so i wanted to help my dream , and i wanted to be able to achieve an international assistance .
and i &apos;m going to be more and more and more and more productive in the world , including ted stage .
thank you .
it would be nice to be nice .
it &apos;s an asphaltenes whipped around , and it &apos;s a good material , but it &apos;s very good , very good , very , very good weather , very , very , very , very quickly .
there &apos;s a lot of water .
and especially if you &apos;re riding bikes , you &apos;re riding the bike ride .
it &apos;s a lot of noise .
it &apos;s kind of a funny way , if we &apos;re going to build roads , like the dutch road , like that , we would like to do that .
the solution is to the problem is that we use is porous .
the material is that this material in the netherlands , and it &apos;s porous , and it &apos;s porous , and it would be easier to drive a water , and it &apos;s easy to drive without water .
noise will disappear in the noise .
because it has a lot of noise , so it &apos;s quiet .
of course , it has its flaws , and it &apos;s likely to be the case of asphalt .
what &apos;s called the road ? the road off the road .
and then , a more and more and more , and later , i did not demonstrate .
but they &apos;re going to be damaged , you &apos;re not happy .
and finally , this leads to more and more and more damage .
sometimes it &apos;s going to happen .
ah , he &apos;s ready .
and of course , the problem is , but we can fix it .
and here you see this material is happening .
this is the asphaltenes like me , and i said that there was a small amount of debris fields .
because the reason for ultraviolet ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , and the  UNK   UNK   UNK  , and if it breaks down , it would be small , and if they start beating the  UNK  .
and if you look at the way , you see , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to see .
to deal with this problem , we think about ourselves .
and if we could have this material , it could be possible .
we &apos;re using clean up with steel wool steel , cheap steel with steel wool socks to velvet block us .
so now , there are some asphaltenes in some ways .
you need to have a machine , like this .
sensing the stuff that you can be very good at fixing stuff .
so what we &apos;re going to do is to heat up , which is the asphaltenes get whipped away from asphalt .
and because it &apos;s too big , i &apos;m not going to come up here .
it &apos;s like a  UNK  principle .
i put samples out of samples , and now take it out of what &apos;s happened .
here &apos;s samples .
we &apos;ve got samples from the industrial lab .
we &apos;ve looked at samples , and we &apos;ve looked at our government , and we decided to give them a fun , and we should do it . &quot;
the government has given us a license on the highway , where we were on the highway , and we were doing it .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . and you see that , of course , is that it &apos;s going to be sure .
we took samples from the way we took samples in the lab .
so we did a lot of experiments , and we use them to use them to try to waterproof , and testing them .
we can go .
in fact , the results of this experiment is that if we &apos;re on the road , we &apos;re going to heat up on the road congestion charges , and we &apos;re going to move the road , four years -- of course , four years , we &apos;re going to double the amount of fuel , of course , the amount of money , and of course , we &apos;re going to have a lot of money .
so , the conclusion is that we built a material , and we use the energy to use to use the energy of the road , the amount of energy that can actually double the amount of energy that we can use to double the amount of money .
you wonder whether you &apos;re curious .
we &apos;re looking at samples .
in fact , i &apos;m going to make it cooling down .
but i &apos;m going to try .
look , really , it turned out .
thank you .
i want to talk to you a very unusual animal .
on earth .
it &apos;s an  UNK  .
and whenever you see , it &apos;s just like a few words , you know , it &apos;s  UNK  , and it &apos;s disgusting , and it &apos;s scary to think about it .
i want to change that way . i think we &apos;re going to change these attitudes , because we need to think about them .
let me tell you why .
first of all , why do they leave us ?
in  UNK  , charles darwin walked across the atlantic ocean , across the atlantic , and in turkey , and he found that in turkey , and he said , &quot; well , the  UNK  of the birds . &quot;
you &apos;re very difficult to find a lot harder than charles darwin .
you know , the u.k. , and he went back to the uk , and i &apos;ll tell you why i &apos;m going to tell you why .
it had been caught by a  UNK  dog , like dogs ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  characters become silly .
and recently , if you look at the news in kenya .
i &apos;m going to ask you to know why ?
because there &apos;s no natural variability .
you can &apos;t stop disease .
it &apos;s almost no longer .
they &apos;re very far away .
and , i like this one of my favorite parliamentarians .
in this world , there &apos;s a  UNK  in the world .
the new world is growing out of the continents , like america , and the americas , and all the continents , and there were 11 , 16 , and they had a risk of  UNK  .
so why is it important ? well , first , first of all , it &apos;s important to understand .
it &apos;s an issue of nature .
they &apos;re going to eat meat out of their  UNK  .
they could eliminate every single bacterial species on the bacteria , and they can stop from the virus that caused by livestock and the disease and livestock and pets of the disease .
the recent research shows that there &apos;s no chance to survive in the region , three or four times more than three or four times the disease spread .
and there &apos;s a lot of history .
they connect cultures with ancient cultures .
UNK   UNK   UNK  , the ancient egyptians , the ancient  UNK  and  UNK  , usually with the  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , egypt and  UNK  , egypt and egypt .
in the  UNK  , the  UNK  of  UNK  ,  UNK  , he risked his life , he risked his life .
in tibet , it seems to be important in tibet , especially in the background , in tibet , and there &apos;s no inclination for the lack of wood , so there &apos;s a natural system , so there &apos;s a natural system .
so , what are the questions ?
in kenya , growing eight , six of eight , six .
a lot of  UNK  , it &apos;s because it &apos;s happening in kenya , and it &apos;s happening in kenya .
in south asia , countries like india , pakistan , india and pakistan ,  UNK  , and that means that they &apos;re going to be 15 years old , and within 15 years , that means that the reason that it means that the death rate is due to the ingredients that actually feed .
now , in the  UNK  of  UNK  , india has been banned in india .
because in the number of  UNK  , the herd would be wild dogs in the wild animals , and in the wild places like india .
it &apos;s going to be the largest  UNK  turbine manufacturer in kenya : turbo .
i &apos;m not going to develop the wind , but we should consider the fact that the government decided to cut off the birds . &quot;
they &apos;re  UNK  .
in west africa , there &apos;s no pity , no need for  UNK  and  UNK  .
what are we doing ? we &apos;re doing this .
we &apos;re trying to figure out how to understand the environment .
and what we find is that these different countries are traveling , so if you focus on the rest of the country .
we need to deal with the entire government .
we &apos;re trying to interact with local residents .
we &apos;re trying to figure out what they &apos;re trying to understand the benefits of these creatures and are grateful for them .
what are you going to do ? you can actually act , and you can actually tell them , and you can actually tell us that the government needs to tell us that we need to focus on them .
and when you walk out of this room , you know , it &apos;s not only about your house , but tell people you about your story .
they are so elegant . charles darwin said , &quot; charles darwin would change his perspective , and he saw it in the air .
kenya , the world is going to lose a lot of money , if you lose these species .
thank you very much .
we can get a lot of people around us in a different way .
we don &apos;t always have to meet our neighbors , so even if we live in a public space .
so in the past few years , i tried to try to make a difference in the past couple of years , and the public space of chalk .
these are all of the questions that i have asked myself , like , &quot; how many of my neighbor ?
how are we going to be able to stay connected in the neighborhood ?
how would we be able to build a better place , to build a better place to understand that we live ?
how to express our ideas that we can see what &apos;s happening in our communities that we can now reflect our needs now ?
i &apos;m living in new orleans .
so , those of course , i can get to touch the souls of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  and the  UNK  of the  UNK  , and i &apos;m sure that the cities are filled with the cities .
when someone came up , i felt a new orleans .
new orleans , the most beautiful building cities , but she &apos;s also the most abandoned buildings .
i was living in this building , and i wanted to think about how this community is going to be a better place in this community .
in 2009 , i lost my loved ones .
her name is  UNK  , and she said to me , she had a mother died of her mother , and she had a sudden , she didn &apos;t expect .
and i thought a lot about death , and then she goes on , and i had to get my life , and i had a very meaningful experience of life .
but i was very difficult to stay in daily life .
i think it &apos;s so easy to remember that it &apos;s really important to remember everything .
so i was working on a little bit of an abandoned skyscraper houses in this building , and i took a big wall , and i came up with the chalkboard , and i thought , &quot; okay , so i thought , &quot; okay , so i could share some of them with a little bit of their own life .
i didn &apos;t know what this experiment was expected , but the entire day after the entire day , and there were some answers .
i &apos;d like to tell you some people on the wall .
&quot; before i die , i want to accept the trial for me . &quot;
&quot; before i die , before i die . &quot;
&quot; before i die , before i die in front of the audience . &quot;
&quot; before death , before the tree died . &quot;
before i die , before i die of a hermitage . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i think she &apos;s dead . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to be a  UNK  . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to make myself . &quot;
and this was a kind of abandoned architecture that became a dream of a place that i wanted to make a dream , and i was laughing so grateful that i had been for comfort .
it makes us believe that we are not alone .
let &apos;s have a whole new kind of insight into the mind .
and we &apos;re going to create a space that we have to remind ourselves that we are constantly changing the most important thing to change .
this is the blackboard , and i &apos;ve been doing this , and i &apos;ve got some interest in the community , and i wanted to send them to the community , and so i wanted to create a small group of people , and so i &apos;ve now got a small group of the world .
and the signs of hints , if we have a chance to express our wishes to be able to share a space .
what we have is the most important two things that we have time , and one is another .
in the age of  UNK  , the age of self , life and life is less vulnerable than ever before .
we &apos;re always talking about death and death , but i think about death , and i was one of the most powerful things that we can do .
think about dying of your life .
public space can be better , what &apos;s important for us , whether it &apos;s true , whether it &apos;s true or not just for us to share with the community , but we want to share with fear and help us create a better place .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
i was in ghana in a mine in ghana .
air was dirty , very hot air is very difficult to breathe .
and i can feel that i can &apos;t see people around me , but i &apos;ve never seen before , but i can &apos;t see anything else .
and i hear people around the world , but it &apos;s also a  UNK  tool .
other people like me , with a head of  UNK  with a blade of grass on my head with a naked eye on the wall , and i was holding on the wall .
my hands came up with a few minutes ago , immediately before he came up to the miners .
and when i stand here today , you know , i &apos;m going to spend your life in the mines .
and i ended up being able to get home to the miners who had never been able to come home .
in the past 28 years , i &apos;ve been taking over the last 28 years of my country has been honored to be in 2009 .
and i met a lot of people who met a lot of people who were working on the modern humanitarian aid organizations that have worked on the modern world .
and we talked about it , and i started to know about slavery , and i know that slavery has been completely wrong .
after the end of the conversation , i was very badly , and i feel ashamed of myself , and i feel ashamed of myself , and i don &apos;t know how many people are ashamed of ?
and this led to me to a couple weeks later , and i went to see the intersection of los angeles , and i want to do want to make a difference .
and so i started a journey .
strangely , these places where i &apos;ve been .
and i &apos;ve got them to see them as a second .
but again , i &apos;m going to go to see the secrets of light .
it &apos;s estimated 3.5 million people around the world .
this is the number of trade in the transatlantic slave trade .
150 years ago , 150 years ago , an american manufacturer .
that &apos;s the equivalent of the $ 50,000 .
but over the course of the entire family , the entire family size of the entire family .
it was shocked by the global slave labor of 1.3 billion dollars a year .
they &apos;re a lot of people who are false accusations ,  UNK  , and no good education , no need jobs for free , and without having a threat to violence .
today , it &apos;s not true of slavery today , but the value of slavery .
there exists in the world in the world , even in the world , even if it was illegal .
in nepal and india and nepal .
the ancient egyptians had come into the ancient egyptians , or describing the  UNK  or  UNK  .
in 50 percent of the heat , women , in fact , the entire family , in fact , that the entire family would turn into the top of their heads , and then the top of their heads off the top of a few hundred meters .
they were fighting off the oil and they were running out of silence and over again .
it can &apos;t break , you can &apos;t drink water , because they don &apos;t need to survive .
and because of the hot air was filled with my camera and i couldn &apos;t get wet .
every 20 minutes , i &apos;m going to get back to the air conditioning on my car , and i &apos;m going to hit the air conditioning on the car , and i want to sit on the car , and i &apos;m trying to get a little bit better than the person .
go back to my shoulder , but i think it &apos;s growing up in the house , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here , &quot; don &apos;t get here . &quot;
and he explained to me that in this place like this , and it &apos;s a dangerous place for me , not only for me .
i couldn &apos;t give them any way to offer them .
i can &apos;t give them money , i can &apos;t give them .
i &apos;m not that country .
my behavior is probably going to be able to make them worse .
i would expect to be able to organize the system around them .
so , for me , i have to wait to taste it .
and in the  UNK  , i &apos;ve been doing the  UNK  by the side of the road by the side of the road .
those plates are smaller than the ones that carry their laundry into the branches of grass , and they put their laundry into the stone plates .
this is an incredibly painful event that was painful .
how are we going to be able to hide , but what is it ?
some people don &apos;t even think that they &apos;re not being born into slavery , because they &apos;re not having a day , because they are born .
no .
if these people were trying to get rid of freedom .
these are  UNK  men who are paid , but they want to give up the middle of the reserve , and they would like to stay in the middle of the east , and they continue to do this , but they are now .
the deal is that we have been hearing about the world , because i was told , because i was told that when i was told that if i was going to make a sense of security industry .
in kathmandu , in kathmandu , and i was a woman .
and they walk around me with the staircase .
it &apos;s not a room .
it &apos;s more like a restaurant .
and the balconies go on the side of the streets are known for prostitution .
small women , sexual  UNK  and women and children are seven and seven-year-olds do make a better woman .
each of the dirty , and it &apos;s very dark , and the curtain was disconnected from the curtain .
it &apos;s a cruel job of the lives of cruel to live .
and remember , i was standing in a dark , and i felt intense confusion that i was trapped in hell of a hell of hell .
there &apos;s only one : i walk through the staircase .
no .
nobody &apos;s  UNK  .
these are people who had gone to run away , and we know that it &apos;s important to know that the benefits of being traded in the same backyard .
there are thousands of restaurants and thousands of people who are not alone .
recently , the new york times a year in the new york times a year .
and these things are happening around us , we don &apos;t know .
and the textile industry is that we have a lot of work .
i was visiting a village in india .
this is a family portrait . &quot;
it was surrounded by his hand , and this blue is the red and blue .
they &apos;re deeply embedded in the  UNK  , and then they put it into the cold chain , and it was toxic .
i tell them my story .
we didn &apos;t have freedom . they said , &quot; they said .
&quot; oh , we want to be able to get away from the rest of the room . &quot;
it &apos;s been estimated that 40 children &apos;s been under the  UNK  of the world , where we have been around the world .
we went there , and i went to see it .
i see it seemed to be a little bit of a little spots , like a little dots , like , right ?
they &apos;re wrong .
children are being sold out by the way to work out of their work on the boat .
this boy is eight years old .
and when we close to the boat , he &apos;s on his  UNK  , we hit the canoe on the canoe , and he &apos;s on the canoe .
he was scared of the water .
the lake  UNK  trees are often mixed up with the trees , and they were exhausted , and if they were caught in the net .
a lot of people are drowning .
he goes from the beginning of his work .
he was very scared , because he couldn &apos;t run away , he was treated with him as small as a child slaves .
when i saw that in the morning , i see the boys in the morning , they start from one in the morning .
in the cold winter night sky .
you know , they &apos;re going to fill up the net .
i &apos;m going to introduce you .
he was a fishing village of fishing .
he saw a homeless shelter in the homeless shelter in the homeless shelter .
he &apos;s actually taking a bath on his head , and the good news is that the good news is that the good news is that they have been able to make sure that their kids are safe .
there &apos;s a possibility of possibility .
it &apos;s because someone who has a impact on the future of his life .
driving along with the road on the road trip to ghana with a partner with a companion where we drove along with a truck , and suddenly we drove around the window .
he made us to change the jungle .
and at the end of the morning , we get out of the car .
and then he pointed out to the floor , and he said , &quot; this is the road . &quot;
we &apos;ve got to get rid of the fruit of  UNK  , and i &apos;ve been able to take a couple of hours of water , and i went to her chest ached so much .
two hours later , a path of two hours a path that we had a huge amount of money in front of an hour of the football fields in front of the football fields .
a lot of women who are in their own backyard , where they were caught in fire .
this is mercury from mercury from mercury .
these people have enslaved in the mine in ghana .
and when they walked out of the mines .
and i remember they were exhausted , and there are lots of 72 hours of 72 hours of 72 hours .
it &apos;s about 90 meters , and they were filled with the rock pools of rock pools of rock pools .
UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , but we got a big deal , but we find some people who are in the margins .
they are victims of violence .
in fact , these are robust mouse rejuvenation , and it &apos;s probably the same as long as it would be like to be treated like this .
this is when he was dead , his father died of his uncles .
in his uncle , he &apos;s going to continue his uncle , he &apos;s got forced to work .
i met him in 14 , and he was 14 years old , and he saw this photograph was taken in 14 years of the doctor , at the time , the doctor was going to have a doctor .
except that , he had injury , even though he had to do this , he had to get a job .
so even , he dreamed of heroic dreams , the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of expression of education , which is that it &apos;s almost unbelievable .
i want to give us some slaves .
and when i was photographing a lot of the candle problem , i took a lot of candle to help me make the candle problem , and i wanted to make them a story , and when i was able to make them a whole series of safety .
they knew that these images would be seen before .
i want them to know what they &apos;re going to do , and we can make them change their lives .
i really believe that when we think about the people who have to think about it .
these are images about the images of people , but i &apos;m not worthy of your dignity , and i deserve your dignity .
i didn &apos;t want to be a beautiful day , but i don &apos;t want people to be treated .
i hope that these images that you can see the power of the eye , and i hope that this will be the light of the power of light , because if i &apos;m not going to live in the shadow of light .
thank you .
and i mean , i &apos;m applying mathematical principles to mathematical principles for mathematical problems that we have a special mathematical problem .
nobody knows what we &apos;re doing .
so i &apos;m going to show you some examples of what we &apos;re doing .
well , one of them is one of the activities .
we were sunbathing and our maestro with dance , and you know , and you &apos;ll know , you &apos;ll know .
now it &apos;s important to have a professional expertise and professional skills , and even the professional skills that we &apos;re talking about talent .
but sadly , parkinson &apos;s disease , parkinson &apos;s disease , like parkinson &apos;s disease , alzheimer &apos;s disease , and that &apos;s what happened to me was that he was the age of the  UNK  .
and so , he had a lot of therapy .
and yet , there are a million people in the world , and they have a cure disease , and they have no symptoms of the disease , and so we have to treat other symptoms .
we need to measure the objective measurement of objective , when we want to know when the only way we have to have the only objective way we can answer the question .
but it &apos;s amazing parkinson &apos;s disease , parkinson &apos;s disease , and there &apos;s no way to go through your blood , and we can see the best could be able to do this , which is the best test for 20 minutes .
you &apos;ve got to get a clinical trial , and it means that there &apos;s a clinical trial that nobody has ever done before .
but what if the patient &apos;s home ?
and that &apos;s what that patient could go to the clinic , if you can test this ?
it doesn &apos;t require a lot of money to hire people .
by the way , by the way , the top of the clinics .
so i &apos;d like to propose you a way to try to get a resolution of trying to figure out what we &apos;re trying to do , because at least in some ways , we &apos;re at least in some ways .
i have a little video about  UNK  .
this is a state of health , and we &apos;re thinking about ourselves as a voice , because when we want to coordinate locomotion , because when we &apos;re dealing with these genes .
and it &apos;s like ballet ; they need to train .
you can think about how long it took to take a minute .
from the sound of the sound that we can find in the position , as if we can influence our lives .
you can see the trajectory of the trajectory of the irregular ring .
we saw the same symptoms .
voices , the  UNK  and  UNK  .
now , you know , and you can hear more comments like this .
and in fact , most of course , most famously doesn &apos;t have a digital microphone , but it &apos;s a digital microphone in a digital world &apos;s newest version of the newest cheap machine , and we &apos;re currently working on other people .
so , what &apos;s based on the basis of testing , what would they do with a clinical trial , which is actually testing them .
it &apos;s a test of  UNK  , and they &apos;re using existing equipment .
you don &apos;t have to design a new hospital .
they &apos;re also going to be able to say , although it &apos;s not based on an expert .
that means that patient can do it .
and it &apos;s fast enough , just 30 seconds .
it &apos;s very low prices , and we know how to go .
and once it &apos;s too cheap .
so i &apos;m here to get out here .
we can reduce the patient and logistics .
no need to go to a check .
we can democratize access to objective data .
we can organize lots and lots and lots and lots of people , and we can also show the number one of time .
we also have opportunity to start looking for this disease before we can go through the early stages .
so today , starting from the beginning of the first step , and we started with the first step .
and with  UNK  , we &apos;re going to work together , and we want to collect all over the world .
our numbers are seven billion people on earth .
any health or parkinson &apos;s disease or parkinson &apos;s disease or parkinson &apos;s disease , it &apos;s very cheap , and i &apos;m very happy to be six hours , and we &apos;re going to be six eight hours .
thank you .
max , these guys , say , &quot; how do you identify who are healthy , who &apos;s a disease , who is the test ?
what are you going to sample these samples ?
right . so , you &apos;ve got to leave him , and you &apos;ve got to tell us whether you &apos;re talking about this disease .
you know , some people may not be calling us .
but we &apos;re still going to get a lot of different environmental data from different sources of different environments , because we &apos;re trying to get rid of all those factors that are really looking at the real risk of factors .
so what are you right now ?
it &apos;s far more than that .
in fact , my student  UNK  , and i asked him , because he has been able to prove that there &apos;s been a proof that we can prove that there is 99 percent of the right now .
okay , well , that &apos;s great .
so that means that people can get the phone -- you can get into your phone , and then you have parkinson &apos;s disease , and then you can get the phone call , and then they got the phone number of doctors .
that &apos;s the way .
thank you very much .
thank you .
since i &apos;ve got enough camera , i &apos;ve been love with photography , but i want to share with you today , i &apos;m most passionate about 15 pies .
no artistic director , without guidance , without guidance , without getting more  UNK  .
in fact , most of them are randomly took randomly .
i had a wonderful story of  UNK  , i was in new york city , my wife gave me a picture of my wife , and i was standing on the day , on the fifth birthday of the mall .
one year later , we went back to new york city , so we decided to take a picture of new york city .
you can guess what &apos;s happened .
it &apos;s close to my wife , and say , &quot; hey , why don &apos;t you go back to the ride back in new york . &quot;
it &apos;s also from the way we &apos;re looking for our visitors .
you know , i handed a stranger to a photo of strangers .
nobody &apos;s ever going to be lucky enough . we didn &apos;t take the camera .
at that time , we didn &apos;t know that it would change our lives .
and for us , it became increasingly sacred .
this is a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and i was trying to explain what happened on 9 / 11 .
so these pictures are far more than just a moment .
they are the way that we have to remember that one week , and for a week , and we think about how we change our bodies , and how we change the body .
because i took a picture of me every year , and we didn &apos;t look at her daughter , and she looked at her eyes , and she looked at her eyes , and she looked at how she sees it .
this is the time that we spent a year in the year of our time .
and recently , we went on the road , and suddenly she pointed out , and suddenly she pointed out to the red ribbon of the studio , and she loves the red , and she starts to go from the studio .
she described to me as a time , she was standing at the time , she felt at the time .
she said , she remembers that the heart of the heart of the heart attack , and that was nine years ago .
now she goes to new york , because she decided to go to new york .
and all of a sudden , one of the most important things that we are .
so i want to share this kind of conscious mind .
i don &apos;t know you , but i don &apos;t know , except for me , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s within a family .
i always took the camera .
i want to encourage you to take some pictures of people in this room , don &apos;t go to the room and ask people to take a picture of us ? &quot;
thank you .
