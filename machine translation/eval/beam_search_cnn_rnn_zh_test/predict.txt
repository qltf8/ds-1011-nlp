hello . i &apos;m  UNK  kevin kelly .
this is true .
so today we talk about these videos , and they will become even more important .
we &apos;re going to be a celebrity -- celebrity , a stand-up comedian -- when i was young , and it was very hard .
but now it &apos;s going to allow us to make it happen , so that anybody can do what we want to do .
all of you are famous for the web , on saturday .
but 48 hours video on youtube video
in tiny , there are only a tiny fraction of these tiny  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  culture .
how does this happen ?
the three :  UNK  ,  UNK  communities .
ok , let &apos;s look at .
UNK  bears : oh god , oh god , oh god .
oh , my god !
oh !
oh , wow . wow !
last year , mr. berlusconi took a video while he was filmed .
in 2010 , we watched 2,000 video .
this chart shows the video at the end of the summer .
but the bear had never been filmed all over the world .
he wants to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what it means is that it &apos;s 1938 for inflation .
he took videos of videos .
this video actually took january of january .
so what is happening ?
and here &apos;s jimmy jones .
jimmy wales recalls gave him a video .
because there &apos;s marc chagall , which is a precursor for us to explore the interesting new thing .
rng : the friday friday friday friday friday friday friday friday friday friday friday friday friday friday friday , friday , friday , friday friday night , friday , friday friday night , friday , friday , friday friday night .
rebecca newberger : one of the is the
it &apos;s almost like 200 million people in the year .
this chart shows this trend .
this bear with a grizzly bear , and he said , &quot; no , you know , you &apos;re not going from red .
what does this happen ?
oh , that &apos;s the friday friday .
if you &apos;re sitting there , those peaks are wandering around .
but what &apos;s happening in this day friday ?
so here &apos;s the word &quot;  UNK  , which is a lot of tribal  UNK  .
the science of television shows up with michael  UNK  nelson mandela .
so the point here is that a group of individuals or a group of videos , and they share with you the latest iteration , and the whole thing they &apos;re going to do .
and this peers is shared with jokes and share it , and it &apos;s not only going to talk about it .
so now , there &apos;s a couple of thousand tedtalks on youtube .
so monday went on monday .
unlike the mass of the 20th century , the media landscape , which is part of the collective action that allows us to become part of innovation .
it &apos;s just a cartoon with a cartoon .
that &apos;s just this .
it goes to 1,000 times per year .
and if you think this is an amazing video , you can imagine , it &apos;s harder than you think about three hours of video .
there &apos;s even more .
the cat watching watching this cat .
but most importantly , this idea of creative technology , the technology geeks .
it &apos;s made of  UNK  .
somebody made it .
and then it goes along linear routes .
the whole thing about reviving this red hair is just a trick that you can get involved .
because now we &apos;re not only yet , we &apos;re involved .
who knows that everything could be ?
who does the word &quot;  UNK  &quot; or &quot;  UNK  or &quot;  UNK  ? &quot;
how do you write this script ?
and over the two days , enough two minutes , video just over the world and video just a video just about video
a friend of mine took a good friend of mine , a new york city in new york city , and i had no interest in new york city .
casey andy : i had a ticket officer , because i didn &apos;t have a lot of bikes on bike lanes , but i couldn &apos;t afford lots of bike lanes on bike lanes .
kevin  UNK  : what &apos;s interesting ?
in this way , we &apos;ve got every aspect of innovation .
so we have a problem like this ...
voice 1 : what &apos;s the bears ?
oh ...
kevin : what does this mean ?
now , guru guru , and altruism , new and new media is to share the characteristics of human beings .
as yeats , now , justin bieber are  UNK  and  UNK  .
you don &apos;t have to be  UNK  .
we see we have cultural autonomy .
and yet this is not the old medium of the old medium , but also the ones that cannot represent the media , but they &apos;re not going to be the future of entertainment media .
thank you .
i &apos;d love to talk about three minutes of my talk , three generations of my older friends , and with this amazing little girl , she &apos;s about her mother and her four-year-old daughter , and the mother of my mother has been relegated to five years old .
a recursive story .
it &apos;s like a cartoon in the puzzle .
and let me tell you a piece of audio .
in retrospect , the first one was as a man to work as hard as a man .
he was a poet  UNK  and a lifetime of freedom .
imagine him as an observer as a father who lost his life .
at the same time .
he silence in silence .
he &apos;s been alive .
he &apos;s my grandfather grandfather .
i never understood his life .
but we live longer than our lives .
grandfather kept him alive .
and my responsibilities is that he doesn &apos;t let me go through my college , and it &apos;s my belief that we &apos;re trying to learn from our history , and we &apos;re trying to get us .
the next morning is one of the canary in the morning .
my mother , 18  UNK  , a series of marriages with a series of marriages .
and for the only purpose of her life , her family had begun to go to australia .
it was just impossible to see .
so four years ago , the novel was a detailed story behind the debris that go beyond the sea .
most people know they &apos;re dangerous .
it &apos;s the biggest threat , rape and death .
like all adults , my mother took a little bottle .
if we were attacked , i was my mother , my mother and my mother and my grandmother .
my first lesson from my memory was -- the engine continues on the surface of the tectonic plate , the sea level .
and i don &apos;t remember the pirates for several reasons , but they were  UNK  away from the boat .
but remember , i remember oil wells that led light from malaysia to the coast of hawaii , and for a long time ago , i was the first note from a high-ranking .
it didn &apos;t eat the seafood anymore .
in the camp camps , three of our camp camps , we live in .
the next one is about three women working together .
they live in an alpine settlement : growing migration .
it doesn &apos;t look like other people , and i don &apos;t forget , i don &apos;t think about it anymore .
the store taste is from the world as a world .
speaking about the same time , english is the same thing to communicate with each other .
a mother started working in rural areas , and then went back to six days , six days , six days .
sometimes she used to learn english , she learned it .
we &apos;re poor .
it saves money every single year .
there was a hole in germany , and there was a hole in the front of a
there are many ways to do that .
now , despite the , , searching search for occasionally , lots of people say , &quot; go home . &quot;
where do you go home ?
and it &apos;s kind of  UNK  .
it &apos;s a sound wave , quiet and quiet and say , &quot; i &apos;m going to go beyond you . &quot;
my sister and my mother and my mother and my bed with my bed bed bed .
every mother , the night night , home one night , but we &apos;d talk to each other night in the evening .
my mother was always nightmare .
and my job as i was awake , when she was awake , she woke up .
she she &apos;s running a computer , she wants to learn , a learning a future .
there are stories that are not hardened ,  UNK  , nerdy kids , like the world .
for funding and funding , funding .
building it center .
i live in parallel life .
on the one hand , i am a typical student in asia .
on the other hand , i became dangerous , dangerous conflicts , violence , drugs and drugs .
but for many years .
when i was prosecuted when i was prosecuted , i was prosecuted as young as a young man .
i took direct directly from one another , and i didn &apos;t have a beautiful connection .
tan le bar√≥n has a normal wheelchair , now , activists , activists being invited to a stranger who hadn &apos;t heard before .
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know how to use it .
you don &apos;t talk about wine .
you won &apos;t speak .
and i &apos;d like to go back to live in the suburbs of the suburbs of suburbia -- the grandmother and the netherlands , and for two years , and those two daughters were alive in the past two years .
i told my mother . i couldn &apos;t do it .
she reminds me me , and she took me off to me , and she took me when i was down here .
there &apos;s no choice .
&quot;  UNK  , she said , &quot; what she really does . &quot;
and so i &apos;ve talked about the rise of the unemployed arts and education and political class and political rights .
and the more i said , the more i asked people to do .
the people around me , people who do enjoy their lives .
even though i finished my career , i realized i wasn &apos;t allowed to my career .
here &apos;s another puzzle puzzle .
and at the same time , i realized realized , as an outsider , the nearest thing , you know , you know , you &apos;re not only in the news , you can learn from a lot of
because as a result , it &apos;s easier to give up , and it &apos;s easy easy to imagine .
now i &apos;m standing up at the comfortable comfort zone , in the world , not worrying about the world .
impossible to allow you to zoom in .
so there &apos;s energy , and with a combination of people , mixed with a lot of resistance .
follow my hunch .
i gathered together one group , and i couldn &apos;t do the &quot; &quot; the challenge . &quot;
for a year , we don &apos;t .
and every single day , one day , i would like to share with you .
every night .
most of our crazy ideas are crazy , and we are smart , we are smart .
i think it moved to america .
after traveling .
and again , i was a very successful instinct .
i got three months later .
so let me say that my grandmother grandmother .
she grew up in the old age ,  UNK   UNK  .
a couple of centuries had never changed .
she was born , father .
it &apos;s a great parent .
she was 17 years old and she married years old ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
there was not a husband , who took her husband to the court , and she decided to win and win her reputation .
impossible .
when she was sitting in 600 miles in melbourne , i was sitting at night in melbourne .
and through her eyes , i saw her across the hall .
i know that she is a goodbye .
my mother bought a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went to visit her  UNK  , and she sat down in her temple .
we told stories , she promised us to keep her with her .
in the middle of the night , we told him , he had to be in the
my mother gave us her hand .
and she said , &quot; why don &apos;t echo their homes , so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been working on this morning , and he says , &quot; he said .
&quot; you never go .
if we have a family , it must be women .
when we think about our bodies and our lives , we now have to think about a state , we have to be brave , we have to be able to deal with it .
failure failure .
so i want to take care of my own children .
who does not want ?
and yet , i fear privilege and privilege .
to give them a brave , brave , and every , bone , , , , , , , , , , , can without permanent ,
i don &apos;t know .
but i can look at it , and they look at their security , and i hope that .
and at the same time , today , the fourth day here today ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
i &apos;d like to share with you today .
or , this is the camera work ?
because this is obviously a camera photo , but you don &apos;t use it .
however , i started interested in my photos with my first digital camera , when i first got 15 .
this was inside of my paintings , but i didn &apos;t have a whole lot of time , because it had gotten a whole lot of time .
when you take a camera camera when you &apos;re touching the shutter lag .
so it seems to me to focus on the right more specifically .
i think anyone can do this .
so i wanted to do something special about this particular thing when you hit the whole process .
so for instance , this picture is next to the next busy building .
but the most surprising thing .
still spite of still alive .
or like this image , but it &apos;s also colored , but it has a fountain of color , but for a limited amount of time .
what i &apos;m talking about is a legitimate line .
because it turns out that you can actually take something , but i always wanted to think that it would be like a bit more time .
these pictures need you to find out behind them .
so , more attention is a step-by-step inspiration .
but what makes these pictures look like ?
right ?
could you light ?
what is this delusion ?
sometimes different perspectives from different perspectives .
but ultimately , it boils down to our understanding of how the universe perceives the universe and how the world is in a two-dimensional universe .
it &apos;s not about what it &apos;s about , but think about what it looks like .
so i think these guys are very simple .
i think it &apos;s as a real world of reality , where you can incorporate the puzzle in the puzzle of the world world a different reality .
let me give you an example .
and here are three of the real world and the real objects that exist in reality , and we can find them in real three-dimensional world .
but if you take these objects objects like this , you can create visual objects , and it &apos;s like a visual object that exists like it .
but we also know that it doesn &apos;t exist .
so that means that our brains are wired for the brain , because the brain doesn &apos;t even exist .
and this picture is so much .
it &apos;s just different reality .
so this gives us a picture of the stuff that doesn &apos;t normally happen , but we don &apos;t want to go to everyday life .
but when we zoom in this picture , we thought it was worth thinking about it .
and what i &apos;d like to suggest is that we have three simple principles that we &apos;re going to do that .
you see , these images are not special .
but then they come together and create this picture .
so the first principle is that all of the pictures are taken by the same view .
second , the combination is slightly different .
these two pictures are these two identical men in the same way .
the third principle is to tell the difference between the bridge are so different from the bridge .
and anybody &apos;s making this image . it &apos;s how you make it .
by streaking , in the picture , the color shows in the edges of the picture , and in spite of the  UNK  , the images of , , a depth of , with a picture , can reveal a picture of what &apos;s happening in a different picture , and it shows up a single picture of a different picture , and even if you look at a single picture of this picture , even if you look at each other .
here &apos;s an example .
some of you might think this is just one of the parts of the bottom up here .
but this photo is actually photographed by many different pictures .
i personally believe that there is a place to be an easier place , because you don &apos;t have to be with your own thoughts .
but this is actually a lot of planning .
last year , when i came up with a couple of years ago , i know i had a lot of time to prepare for a couple of months .
for example , this fish was a  UNK  .
the other is photographed in the other .
the underwater part is an underwater .
yeah , i &apos;m on the island on the island on the island of sweden , and it looks more similar to sweden .
in order to do that , i think that what i think is the most important function of the
it &apos;s always  UNK  .
and then the combination is different .
and every one here is a picture of planning .
and if you can pull the pictures , it &apos;s beautiful , and it &apos;s beautiful .
so it &apos;s all the tools that we all have our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about a number of projects that i &apos;d talk about a number of years ago .
i think one of the most important stories we don &apos;t have to listen to our patients .
we &apos;re at one of the netherlands at the netherlands at the netherlands , which is one of the  UNK  .
not a very simple way -- a coffee -- or her patient patient ask her patient , right ?
what do we need to help ? &quot;
and i thought , well , we &apos;d like to think that almost every aspect of technology is almost every aspect of failure , and one of the reasons why we don &apos;t have access to healthcare .
this is my weight , and the weight is very simple .
here &apos;s a switch .
every morning , i weigh my morning .
oh , i gave myself a set of instructions , and i can see you see .
i put the weight into weight .
and actually it turns out that it &apos;s a very simple type of data visualization , i &apos;m going to google health data .
and at the same time , when i was able to get him , and then i get him to see what my weight gain weight , and i don &apos;t think about the heart attack , but when it comes to the heart attack , it &apos;s about weight .
but there &apos;s something else .
some of you may know me on the fans fans .
so , i slept in the morning morning , i weighed my weight up , and i had cornered them up and i started to talk about my jane , and i want you to talk about jane austen , and i &apos;m going to call you jane austen . &quot;
but that &apos;s fortunate enough , because that &apos;s when it comes to stress , for the stress of stress , help patients help help prevent smoking cessation can help prevent smoking cessation .
but then , on the one hand , it can bring together to bring some aspect of the game to play .
the next week this is about a week .
and it would be like a smartphone with a smartphone or a smartphone .
and then people were able to measure their blood measurements for the rest of their lives , and they asked them to send a hundred dollars for everyone else .
so this is the key part of the patient , when when they collect data , they &apos;re not only able to manage control and change their processes , but we can address the challenges between our health care centers , or in the health care system , etc .
we need to push technology back to the video to to to patients patients .
you can use this technique of technique that can make it work .
today i &apos;m going to show you a short video that shows you today .
we have all the cars .
even mobile phones .
we know the word &quot;  UNK  .
you know , gas stations .
there &apos;s still  UNK  .
but the nearest burden of medicine can save lives ?
we &apos;re not asking people everywhere .
nobody knows that saving lives saved lives .
we send to the netherlands , send the dutch to the dutch .
we have a website called telling people , and if you see the defibrillator you &apos;re relying on the lift and you leave it to open up the open space station , it &apos;s not open because it &apos;s open to open up 24 hours .
there &apos;s  UNK  in holland in the netherlands .
the next step is developing applications .
we developed an app .
a  UNK  app for  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
and if you &apos;re in somebody , you can see the iphone in your iphone , and you can still buy microsoft .
today i &apos;d like to introduce you today , it &apos;s not just the name product of the product .
we &apos;re going to project it into the world .
and so we &apos;re calling for our colleagues and colleagues around the world , enable us to unite us all together around the world .
you know , when you look for somebody like jim dine , or you might just find someone who &apos;s going to find your family .
we want to call the world companies that help us to .
for example , by the way , by the way , to look over , if you look at the card plate , are  UNK  everywhere .
so , in this project , help us help us not only improve our health , but we can fix it .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to talk about something unexpected .
so now i &apos;m working with solar cells .
so i started with a small company called the nature of nature , which was to try to bring attention to nature .
focusing on me .
it shows a little video that we did .
ah , wait .
i need a load of video .
you might skip skip -- i &apos;m going to ...
don &apos;t .
this is not ... ...
all right .
solar techniques ...
never , i don &apos;t have time ?
well , thank you very much .
a few years ago , i started making something called the design of the technology and design , and what they &apos;re supposed to be working on -- all of the jobs -- the government of trade work .
this project is called &quot; america code , &quot; which is like &quot; peace corps . &quot;
we &apos;re at a few of them , and then the them work for government .
no , they &apos;re going to turn into the city , but they &apos;re going to the
in the city , they &apos;re really great .
but the real purpose of their technology is to present technology today .
this is al .
al jazeera is a  UNK  fire hydrants .
and it looks like it looks like it &apos;s waiting for it , but it &apos;s really real , it can be used to be a  UNK  where it  UNK  snow , because it &apos;s known as it originated down , because as it originated down , it &apos;s known as it has to grow up , and when its dissolved oxygen expands .
how does it use this particular approach to help ?
last year we had the code code for the united states .
when they were february february , february were a lot of last year .
they &apos;re not aware of the city fire .
and the team of people who didn &apos;t have a guy named calvin  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  : the power of civilian  UNK  going on the front door .
so he made a good programmer for any programmer , and he wrote a application .
this is a condition that gives you a nice little baby .
and then you &apos;ll agree that snow is snow .
and if you do that , you can name your name .
but if you don &apos;t dig it , you can steal it from you .
so it &apos;s a little bit of entertainment .
this is relatively relatively simple programs .
it may be the author that wrote a book that was written by the smallest team .
but it hasn &apos;t done anything else .
it &apos;s like viral virus .
a year in hawaii , in the dominican republic , i saw the owner of it , and i realized i didn &apos;t realize that it had the air conditioner .
now the importance of the matter is an important , but it &apos;s often a
so he lets the employees to examine them .
and then he decided to take it for the next harvest and the harvest .
and chicago started to institutionalize it with the snow .
we have now to live in nine cities .
and it follows it , and it follows natural , naturally .
if you know about governments , you know , it &apos;s not uncommon .
they developed a software program .
last year we had three teams in the last two months and a half months .
it could help parents decide what the most important public schools are .
and after , we were told that if we had this program , we would give two million dollars for a year .
and that &apos;s just a small number .
california has been devoted to a $ 40 billion dollars on a $ 40 billion , and it hasn &apos;t worked on it .
and every aspect of government has a program .
so for a couple of days , just for a few days , a program to bind a state agency .
it shows that governments can be more efficient , but more importantly , not like a lot .
it doesn &apos;t even a technology company , like a network .
that means that no , no .
and this is very important .
but these programs are more important , more and more than a generation of governments are seeking to tackle problems to tackle problems , rather than solving a problem .
and this is great , because it turns out that we are right now , we &apos;re very good at what we &apos;re doing right now .
there &apos;s now a very large group of tools that enables us to build our tools .
it &apos;s not just the code of american code , american employees , hundreds of thousands of people in their own communities every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up government .
and although they were disappointed , but they didn &apos;t complain about it , and try to improve it .
these people know what we &apos;ve lost .
that &apos;s when you peel off the ship , and we threw the shell out of the shell , like our political and of our cars , right ?
now there are many people who have a completely open heart .
if you &apos;re one of them , i want you to think about , because there are lots of things change .
political politics doesn &apos;t change government .
and the power of the government , the most fundamental energy from people from us , and how we see how it affects it .
when i started this project , i didn &apos;t know about government .
so people like me , i think it was just a government election .
after two years , i came up with a conclusion , government .
this is a service and phone calls for service .
and if you &apos;re in the cities , you , you will be
and if you would have a chance , you would be working with the university of pittsburgh , and then our team at the university of our colleagues , and in fact , what you need to do is , you need to find government to find out a government that &apos;s going to work with government .
scott &apos;s got a phone call .
he coined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;  UNK  &quot;
he didn &apos;t have any animal imaging .
and finally , he said , &quot; this , you can open your door and open your door and open your door and open your door , and open it up , and then turning it into the music and look at it . &quot;
and that &apos;s work .
but that &apos;s not the end of the story .
there is no central center .
it has a program and a mobile program called  UNK  connectivity .
we didn &apos;t write code .
it was a group of a group of people in the city of new structures , smart people who wrote code .
so one day -- this is a real report -- this report posted out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can &apos;t . &quot;
how do i get it ? &quot;
&quot;  UNK  &quot; questions about different kinds of issues . &quot;
scott scott was a conversation with people .
but the idea is to connect all of these citizens everywhere , so everyone can see everyone .
this time , a neighbor sees a neighbor .
we received a report report by saying , &quot; i &apos;m going to , &quot; &quot; &quot; local and find out the floor in the back . &quot;
you know ?
you throw it out .
&quot; good night . &quot;
so it &apos;s so simple .
so this is great .
this is an example of the government for example .
but this is an example of a government that &apos;s done by the government .
and here i am not talking about the platform of technology .
i just want to talk about a platform that allows people to help each other .
a civil society has an important role in the role of government .
it has two  UNK  .
it can help prevent government service providers , but it needs to be a very attractive neighbor , but it &apos;s a very simple government service .
when a neighbor comes to help us , social relationships will be incentivized .
we call the animal food center , lots of money .
one of the important things we need to think is important to political governments .
a lot of people know that , but they still believe in politics .
we &apos;re dealing with the  UNK  system .
so far , we selected political leaders , and some of us have a lot of support for our political and a political leader in our democratic culture , but we need to change our values , but what we need to do ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a giant ocean , and it &apos;s the politics of politics .
so here &apos;s what we call the so-called  UNK  .
we talk about the word &quot;  UNK  &quot;
but this is the kind of thing that keeps us , and this keeps us paying attention to keep our desires , and we &apos;re losing our desires .
people seem like political sexy .
if we want to make services like this , we have to be  UNK  sexy .
because governments don &apos;t work there .
we have to be involved in government .
and this is the accounting movement of the u.s.
do you see these guys ?
they were about a group of people talking about a party , and they wrote a very detailed description , and reporting reported about the reports of the  UNK  report in the united states senate .
it &apos;s not political . it &apos;s not politics .
now , our government has given us our government , and when we ask ourselves , we want to ask ourselves how to our children .
you have to realize that they require enormous challenges .
so we didn &apos;t improve the system that we could do before , and we thought we &apos;d be able to achieve what we want to achieve ?
we cannot not governments , we need to be more efficient .
all right , this is what it means , is going to be able to be driven by the forces of government , and in our government , we can strengthen citizens in our societies .
this generation is growing up in the network , and they know that they &apos;re not doing it , but it &apos;s just a great system .
the average age of the average age is the age of 28 , so i &apos;m very excited , most of them are older than the generation .
that generation grew up in their lives .
they don &apos;t need to have that experience anymore ; we can win who owns their freedom speech .
they could pass through time through their time , and they do it , and they do it .
so when they were dealing with governments , they were concerned with their voice .
they use their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands working with their government to work better .
and these programs help us develop our own social skills .
it could be a  UNK  fire , a  UNK  , or a bag of rice , or a  UNK  .
and of course , lots of people started climbing fire appliances .
but these programs are just as small as the numbers that remind us , so we &apos;re not just as consumers as consumers .
we &apos;re not just about these citizens .
we have to improve the citizens of government .
so what i &apos;d like to leave you with is : when we are dealing with a big deal , and together , we need to pack together a group together , but we &apos;re going to have a  UNK  party , which is an intuitive group of people who are  UNK  ?
thank you .
and so often because i &apos;m going to try to explain how new technologies are coming up with me , and i think , when i think about it , i would like to say to me , let me try to explain what i really think about it , and how do i catch up with this technology that has happened to catch up .
let me start with this slide .
and then you can put the slide .
this is from random assignment from random .
and what i &apos;d like to show you is not the details of it , but it &apos;s the totality of it .
so this is what we did with the local  UNK  and the power of the power station .
but the interesting thing is that the slide of the slide like us are familiar with a slide projector , a straight line .
and here &apos;s one of them , which is the horizontal level of the level of performance .
on the logarithmic graph , technology is fresh .
and that &apos;s sort of weird .
this is basically what i &apos;m saying .
so let &apos;s go to the lights .
take a gasp of light , because i &apos;m going to use paper .
why do we use this logarithmic technology ?
well , the answer is , if i look at normal design , we said , this is a year , and this is one of those technologies , and i &apos;m going to make a kind of look at something like this .
it &apos;s kind of like that .
and doesn &apos;t provide information .
now , if i , for example , another transport transportation , transportation technology , like a curve , on the horizontal curve , it looks like a curve .
but if you look like this .
and if technology wants to go faster and faster and faster , and then i &apos;ll get a cab in the next 10 seconds .
but it didn &apos;t have fast progress .
in this technology , there &apos;s no increase in the history of that , has no satisfaction .
now , what i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at this curve , these are not going on forever .
it &apos;s not going to change it .
two things happen .
it &apos;s like a typical paradigm like this , completely different .
that &apos;s all possible .
now i am an optimist , so i am an optimist , so i think it might be so .
if that means means , we &apos;re right now .
we seem to think that line in the world is in the past .
so what i &apos;d like to ask , i &apos;ve been asking myself , which is the future of the future ?
what is new ?
and because of this change , it seemed like us , when we were in there .
when i was growing up when i grew up in the future , it was about 2,000 years ago .
now this conference , talking about future future , and you &apos;ll see that in the future , the year 2000 .
that &apos;s what we can do .
in other words , in my lifetime in my lifetime every year .
and i think there &apos;s something wrong with us .
change is happening .
we know that think about the future , three or 50 years ago , because everything is so unpredictable about the meaning of the future .
so i &apos;m going to talk about how we are going to transformation .
so , for me , i &apos;ve got to talk about a lot of computers and technology and computers .
because i realized that the only way to understand the timeline is a timeline timeline .
and what i want to do is look at the timeline of the timeline of the timeline of earth .
i think i think that if you think of the lens of every time , over time , over time .
so if you look at 25 years back about 25 million years ago , there are big trees , little rock rocks .
so if you look at these chemicals , we start to understand how they form .
i &apos;d like to think about how it came from the beginning of life , from the beginning , but i wanted to talk a little bit about the story , and that &apos;s where the story of oil , which is everywhere , and it &apos;s about oil , and that &apos;s all the different chemistry .
there are some of these chemicals in this particular area of chemistry , and they can bring it to the outside world .
it goes like this , and then we &apos;re divided into it .
most of the protocells right now , in some form of cells , these little protocells .
but now that &apos;s not the case of oil , but it turns out that we &apos;re alive today , because every one of them is random .
each time , it &apos;s not linear .
so each of them is slightly different .
in fact , the oil is in different ways of making them better , and they &apos;re more diverse , diverse and diverse combined .
so they &apos;re longer longer , more longer .
it &apos;s kind of like a simple oil , and life chemistry chemicals , but it turns out , when it comes to a learning process .
somehow we don &apos;t understand what we &apos;ve learned .
they learn to take the cells into a special substance , which is called the  UNK  .
in other words , they came up with this method that they wrote , and genetic information can be stored in the way that information is copied .
and the amazing thing that happens is that it seems to be due to 25 years since 25 billion years ago .
in fact , our genetic code is exactly the same way .
in fact , any organism can be recorded with the letter of the letter .
in fact , the only thing that i do do do is make entertainment for the entertainment industry .
i have one of them in the same way , so i &apos;m going to try to do that if i don &apos;t see them .
but what i code inside of the code that i do is , i &apos;m holding it inside the code , and this is what we call it the alphabet , and then i &apos;ll double the letter , and then i put it into a business card .
so if someone needs to have hundreds of my card , i have enough card , and there &apos;s enough everyone here , and everyone here is everyone in the world .
and if i &apos;m a mildly arrogant , i would put it into the room .
so what is next ?
it &apos;s been an interesting thing .
it led to a sudden cell -- they were so happy for over billions of years .
but there &apos;s an interesting thing that happens to begin with a whole bunch of different things , and that exchange information , exchange and aggregates exchange groups .
i don &apos;t know if you know that , bacteria can actually live longer .
that &apos;s why , like ,  UNK   UNK  .
and there are bacteria that learned from that bacteria , and then it would have been able to go down into the fields of bacteria , and there are dozens of bacteria that are  UNK  bacteria , because we &apos;re talking about bacteria .
in this case , these communities are formed , in some sense , they &apos;re in the same boat ; they &apos;re working together .
so they lived together or survive , and if they had a successful community , all of those individual organisms have evolved to evolve .
and so , coming back to the age , and these communities are close together , and in fact , they decided to work together and write down on the entire component .
life in the next epoch of life .
in this period , there are cell types of cell groups that are cell groups , cell groups , microbial communities .
in fact , this is our cells .
we have lots of cells , and they &apos;re not just immune for themselves .
skin cells , no cells , no cells , muscle cells , cells , cells , cells .
so these evolutionary biologists are really interesting .
so here &apos;s what happens .
these cells , again , they start to gather information .
they &apos;re very special , especially in the process of process .
these are nerves neural structure .
so these neurons are formed a new set of information .
in fact , there are truths in groups , and in particular , understanding the information , understanding and learning .
this is the colony of cells and the brain .
this led them to evolve .
because that &apos;s true for each individual -- it &apos;s an organism to be able to travel over time .
so , for instance , for instance , for instance , learn to taste taste , it doesn &apos;t eat it , because it doesn &apos;t eat it , it &apos;s disgusting .
this can happen in an individual lifetime of life , and in this structure of life , in order to generate a sequence of  UNK  processing , which has hundreds of thousands of years .
so , living organism , this extraordinary structure , accelerate acceleration acceleration .
because evolution has been able to happen .
and it &apos;s learning about what happens in time .
but what happens to each individual is , of course , the secrets of communication .
for example , we know the most famous version version of the language is human language .
think about it . it was amazing invention .
i had a complicated brain , and , confusion ,
i &apos;m sitting in front of me , which is basically , you want to build a kind of mess that unfolds into a mess .
but we &apos;re trying to turn into something that sounds like a voice , and it &apos;s a complicated thing to your brain .
so now that &apos;s the beginning of our individual operating system .
so , actually , we &apos;ve accomplished accomplished our human , we &apos;re human beings .
we &apos;re getting through the experience of cells through the same genetic material -- we &apos;ve shown that information .
for example , for instance , this is a very short angle .
the phone , , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we &apos;re dealing with these mechanisms .
these are all interconnected , we &apos;re more faster than we are , faster than we can evolve .
so , now , evolution can be a subtle scale .
you &apos;ve seen this example of that evolution , which you can see in front of you in front of you .
so now we &apos;re going faster .
my story is about the first step over every three billion years .
and the next step , like the , , millions of
and then , for instance , and so forth .
next morning , as if the next few decades .
this process is , and i guess , i think , should i be able to be able to change the .
the more change change faster .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been seeing here .
we we see this process .
now , i am now working with computers , and i know that computers don &apos;t have the computer mechanisms , but if you don &apos;t have a computer .
now , what i &apos;ve done is design that i don &apos;t design design from the design of design .
i don &apos;t know the idea of connecting typology .
there are billions of transistors .
in fact , what i &apos;d like to do is to think of the machines that machines used to us , and we thought it was a certain kind of material , and then it uses more machines than ever before , and we can do more than ever before .
in fact , sometimes it uses it that we don &apos;t understand .
there &apos;s especially interesting recently recently that i &apos;ve been evolving recently .
so what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re designing a 3d machine at a time , and in the process of evolution in the process of incremental transformations .
so , for example , most of us are actually able to get through random sequence from sequence instructions .
say , you have 100 billion random instructions .
so now you &apos;d be able to run all of these random passages , all the way , and try to get the usual suspects .
so , i &apos;m going to define what i &apos;m going to do .
suppose i would argue , it &apos;s an example of this experiment with me .
and find the best way to get to .
and of course , random random instructions would not be quite well , so they couldn &apos;t do it .
but there was a lucky , between luck , and it was two acres .
and i said , &quot; well , you pick the computer out of your computer , and you have 10 percent of the best .
so that &apos;s the rest .
so now replicate the best of these data points .
so we &apos;re mating with  UNK  mating .
and take these two programmers , send them an exchange for them , and these children are blessed with these characteristics two children .
so i get a new generation of projects that are made out of .
and say , &quot; repeat this process . &quot;
again .
maybe some will be brought into mutations .
try and try it again .
each generation builds on every milliseconds .
so i &apos;m dealing with a couple of computer technologies , and for millions of years , a lot of work , which is repeated in a very short period of time .
and at the end of the end , i would have the perfect number of fonts .
in fact , these programmers are cloud-based than any of these devices .
now , if i i read these books , i don &apos;t work .
i tried to read and write about how they work .
they &apos;re weird , abstract .
but they can do that mission .
in fact , i know , i &apos;m confident that they are able to do this because they have a program that they will be able to .
in fact , they &apos;re living through their lives .
i used to work with him and swallow him , and he came up with a card , and he said , &quot; look , look . &quot;
and it says , &quot; there are lots of lots and lots of football players , and are you secure ? &quot;
in fact , we know that the synthesis are not really sophisticated .
so we started to depend on computers to do with a different program .
it allows us to produce much larger than normal production .
however , we don &apos;t understand it .
and in a way , we &apos;re more than
we &apos;re now making these tools to make faster computers faster faster .
so it &apos;s  UNK  .
it &apos;s getting faster , and it &apos;s why i don &apos;t feel like it seems to me .
and all of those technologies gave them back .
we &apos;re flying .
and that is exactly what we &apos;re in a moment , is a organism like a organism cell as a organism cell .
we &apos;re just like stealth .
we are turning the tipping point .
but i think there must be something we have .
and i think it &apos;s sincere , and we think that we &apos;re the ultimate invention of evolution .
and i think that all of us is part of the next step , whatever it is .
it &apos;s coming out , and i &apos;m not dropping it , and i &apos;m thinking , i &apos;m going to end over here .
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
most of my time when i was in prison , prison in prison .
most of my career is in the low-income communities in the areas of the area .
so now , you &apos;re going to see some of the ted elements that you &apos;ve heard from me today .
in this time , i noticed myself at ted .
you can see what &apos;s happening here in the world .
sometimes it happens when it happens in the ted stage on the other side , more than others .
and i think this is because i think it is important .
we &apos;ve heard some presentations .
we &apos;ve realized that as a teacher , if you influence your influence if you &apos;re an entrepreneur , if you &apos;re a rich teacher in your community .
as a doctor , if you can help someone who is a patient leader , if you &apos;re a doctor patient , you can help .
so i want to talk about the importance of importance .
now , i &apos;m not going to learn how to do other projects .
i learned from my grandmother .
my family was a black family , owned by a black family .
she was tough , she was strong strong .
she had a choice ; she had it .
but a lot of thing is her  UNK  .
her parents were really  UNK  .
in the 19th 19th century , in the late 19th century , she was  UNK  .
my grandmother was born in the &apos; 80s that was born in the &apos; 80s who had been made by the world around her .
my grandmother was loving , but she was loving loving .
when i was a young boy , i met her every time i hug her .
she was holding me , and then she came up with me and she would leave me .
one after two hours , i would say goodbye to her , and i asked her , &quot; can i feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; i don &apos;t feel that she feels me when she popped me up till she said , &quot; she &apos;s me . &quot;
she &apos;s the ability to recognize that she wants to be close to .
the only challenge she was she had 10 .
my mother was youngest 10 .
so when i went to my grandmother and i was very hard to get her attention to her , and i noticed her time .
i &apos;m everywhere everywhere .
when i remember , when i woke up in the morning , i woke up , and i woke up all night in the room .
my grandmother sits at the other side of my side .
i started to think we &apos;re playing .
and i watched it , and she was serious , and i was serious .
she was 15 minutes later , she she walked through the house , and walked through my room , and i said to me , &quot; oh , we &apos;ve got to talk about it . &quot;
it &apos;s like yesterday .
i &apos;m always  UNK  .
she took me to me and said , &quot; i want to talk about you and don &apos;t tell you . &quot;
i said , &quot; yes , my grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; no . &quot;
and then we sat down , and she looked at me , and she said , &quot; &quot; i want you to know you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; you are a special child . &quot;
she said , &quot; i believe you can anything anything . &quot;
this will never forget .
and she said , &quot; i want you to give me three things . &quot;
i said , &quot; my grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; first , i want you to assure you that your mother will always be happy . &quot;
and she said , &quot; your mother is worth you , and i &apos;m going to give you a sense of her . &quot;
i loved my mother , and i said , &quot; hi , i &apos;m my grandmother . &quot;
and she said , she said , &quot; yes , you &apos;re going to miss me forever , even if you &apos;re going to be tough . &quot;
and i thought i &apos;d say , &quot; my grandmother , i &apos;m my grandmother . &quot;
and the third thing she said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to assure you . &quot;
i said , nine , i said , &quot; yes , i assure thee . &quot;
i grew up up in the southern camp , and my brother and my brother was one of my older sister , and i was a little girl .
when i carried my brother on my older brother , i went back to -- i didn &apos;t know how i was with him -- and my father and my mother and went to the forest .
it &apos;s crazy .
he drinks a drink , and she handed me to her , and she handed her and she handed me and handed me .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m not so sorry . i don &apos;t drink . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve been messing with the end of the day , and one of our time we are .
i drink a drink , drank drunk , you drink . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t drink . i don &apos;t want you to drink . &quot;
my firm is my pension .
i said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
and then he took me down and ask me , &quot; &quot; oh , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re not going to be worried , you &apos;re going to be worried . &quot;
and i said , &quot; what do you say ? &quot;
he said , &quot; every child , he said , he &apos;s very special . &quot;
i &apos;m sad .
now i want to talk to you .
maybe it shouldn &apos;t be .
because this is going to go over .
now , i &apos;m going to admit this year , and i &apos;m going to admit that i don &apos;t have a lot of beer .
it &apos;s not just to make sense of my own moral imperative .
and when we decided to make the right decision , we allowed them to accept the world .
we can make them make it .
and when i thought about my grandmother , she said , &quot; of course , she &apos;s very special .
i was prosecuted because i was sitting in prison .
i &apos;m not going to die and death .
these principles are , i believe that we should .
i &apos;d like to tell you about criminal justice system .
and for decades , the country has made a lot of different countries .
in 1972 , 300,000 prison .
today , there are  UNK  .
today in the united states , the highest proportion to the highest proportion of the world .
we have seven million  UNK  and  UNK  .
and in my view , it &apos;s totally changed . we change the world .
in the communities communities , in a community of colorful communities , that changed the landscape of despair .
one-third of the third between men and women are between 30 and a half , not a prison in class , or in a prison sentence .
in the city of rio , city in los angeles -- baltimore , baltimore county in southern california -- in the middle of the state of maryland , not in the middle of the prison , or in jail .
we &apos;re not only changing our political attitudes , but it &apos;s around the race race race race .
the state of monopoly system is guilty if you &apos;re innocent if you &apos;re innocent , innocent people .
wealth , not in the middle .
and yet , we &apos;re doing this .
the fear and horror politics divides us .
UNK  .
i &apos;m interested in this .
we &apos;re looking at some of these fun things .
and as a result of that , as a state of monopoly , if you &apos;re sentenced to the rest of your life .
now 30 percent of the people who had 30 percent of the people who had lost their vote .
let &apos;s look at the difference between 10 years : political rights and civil rights .
there &apos;s no question .
i represent kids .
a lot of my studies i was young .
america is the only child in the world .
we have the state of imprisonment for our children .
we &apos;re actually now doing this appeal .
it &apos;s a world .
i &apos;m a surrogate donor .
death penalty death .
we know that from the people who are the are the
it &apos;s a very good question .
but on the other hand , we are  UNK  .
the other problem is that the people who aren &apos;t going to be  UNK  for us .
i mean , this amazes me .
death penalty was an american national geographic .
there were nine people who were charged with a death penalty year later , proven to prove that death penalty .
this one -- the ninth of a man who was totally innocent .
i have to say .
you know , man , you know , if you airplane an airplane in a plane , we wouldn &apos;t have an accident .
but it turns out that we can ignore the death penalty .
because it &apos;s not the problem .
this is not our problem .
this is not our own ego .
so i talked about a lot .
and race , we don &apos;t deserve to be  UNK  .
it &apos;s very interesting . when i teach american history and my students in slavery .
and they talked about terrorism that they &apos;d been working in the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really understand that history .
but for this black country , it was a  UNK  era .
people are scared scared ; people are scared and they are being violated .
people worry about bombs bombs .
that &apos;s changed , and they changed their life .
now at the age of now , at age , i said to myself , &quot; sir , you &apos;ve got to tell you about 9 / 11 to tell us about the first time for america . &quot;
and they said , &quot; i said , &quot; we are when we grew up . &quot;
that &apos;s the end of that , of course , the end of the ended up ended up ended up with decades and advocacy and apartheid .
however , we don &apos;t like this country .
we don &apos;t like history .
so that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what we &apos;ve ever done .
we kept constantly conflicting .
continuing to make a lot of tension .
we can &apos;t talk about it because i don &apos;t believe that we don &apos;t want to look at the issue .
and in south africa , people knew that we weren &apos;t agreed , unless we were honest with the situation .
in 1918 , even after genocide , people argued , we didn &apos;t want to do that .
i &apos;ve talked about the death penalty in germany .
and it was amazing , because there was a philosophical laugh , and he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re going to hear about it . &quot;
she said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death penalty .
and of course , we &apos;re never going to have otherwise . &quot;
all the women burst out and said , &quot; because the history of our history , we decided to be systematically bribed .
autonomy is vital for a decision , and in fact , in the case of marshall  UNK  , we cannot be  UNK  .
i think about this problem .
if i looked at the germans , i feel like when i was trying to make sense , i had to feel what i would feel like ?
i can &apos;t .
that was ridiculous .
but in the state , we are in southern states , we &apos;re really not going to be executed , because the black men are white than the black death penalty crimes of the death penalty of the death penalty because when you &apos;re sentenced to a black death penalty because you &apos;re sentenced to a suicide bomber , you &apos;re sentenced to five times more frequently than that .
but we don &apos;t care .
i believe that we have this crisis .
and when we are dealing with these tricky issues , we are not good for positive clues .
we love innovation .
we love love technology , love love .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , the reality of reality is completely ignored and marginalized and human rights , human rights .
it was necessary for me .
because ultimately we &apos;re talking about what we want to do , and hopefully have more hope , and more to live in a society where we live in a society .
and for me to spend a lot of time thinking about that time , the poor and the poor people will never meet ted .
but they thought they were actually in the sense of their lives in our lives .
you know , we have to believe that those things are not seen .
we have to be
innovation , creativity is not just in our mind .
they &apos;re the wisdom of our minds , our minds and our minds and our belief in our minds .
and this man , i believe that it &apos;s not just us that those things are not obvious to us , but it &apos;s not going to be as bad as the dark side .
UNK   UNK  : the tough case of hardy  UNK  ,  UNK  .
and he said , &quot; when we were dealing with eastern europe , we wanted to be a very important lesson , but most importantly , we wanted to one of the most important experience in the inner direction of peace .
the heart of the heart is the heart of the heart of my belief that we have in our society .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense of the technology and the design technology and the design of our bodies , our distant cousins , we &apos;re just going to realize that we can &apos;t survive , and yet , , poverty , poverty and injustice .
i &apos;d like to remind you that the status quo that doesn &apos;t seem to be missed .
it affects affects you .
when i was a young doctor , i was privileged to meet her .
this is a woman who &apos;s going through a cruise and poke every day , and she &apos;s at the height of her community , aged  UNK  , her trainer &apos;s  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  -- a woman named  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , who &apos;s a  UNK  minister . she &apos;s got a woman named amy meyer .
these women are constantly chatted together .
and she would call me  UNK  .
would you like to hear ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; ma , i would like to . &quot;
she would ask you , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; i want to hear . &quot;
and then i &apos;m listening to the past .
they &apos;re incredibly inspiring .
so one time , i was listening to a couple of hours ago , and she asked me and asked her , &quot; and , &quot; and , i and . .
and i &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot;
i started with  UNK  .
and i said , &quot; we don &apos;t think of the challenge for injustice . &quot;
we wanted to get those men who were murdered .
we want against discrimination and laws .
give them the sentenced for the rest of their lives .
we want to change the rules of change .
we want to decrease in prison .
we want to keep away from overeating .
i did a  UNK   UNK  shot , when i was staring at her , saying , &quot; i &apos;m looking at her . &quot;
she said , &quot; these are tough , you &apos;re tough tough .
at the end of the wall , she came up with her hand and said , &quot; i said , &quot; why is brave brave brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave . &quot; brave brave
i &apos;m sure that this ted society needs more .
we need to find ways to face these challenges , these kinds of challenges .
because ultimately , our humanity , our humanity depends on humanity .
in my job .
i learned a very simple principle .
and i started to understand , and we believe that every single one of us will not be the worst definition of our own .
and i believe that , on this planet .
if he missed a marker , he doesn &apos;t mean that .
if he had no idea what he didn &apos;t meant to him .
and even if you don &apos;t think about it , you &apos;re a killer app .
because i believe there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect dignity .
and i believe that , in many countries , in many places , of places in places like this , not many of the world .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i think , many , many , many , many , the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s quite beautiful , but it &apos;s also very frustrating for us , but ultimately , the technology itself is not yet to be beaten by technology .
and finally , people would say that this is not the case for us , but rather than the rich man , the poor man , with the poor man , we were forced by the people who were criticized .
because that &apos;s what happens when we really started to think about what we are about .
i &apos;m a short story .
i work too well .
so , just like everybody &apos;s here .
sometimes these ideas are too big and think of it .
i used to make them happy .
and i went to see what i found when i saw the  UNK  , and they were labeled adults as adults who were being treated as adults .
and i started thinking , how does this happen ?
a judge , how could anyone judge a different person ?
this judge says he was a kid , but i saw a child .
and one night , i woke up at night , and i woke up a night , and not just the judges , and if you judge another man , it &apos;s a magic trick .
for brian , brian , had a magic judge .
you can &apos;t touch it .
you know , i &apos;ve got to have alzheimer &apos;s head ; i don &apos;t know when it comes to the bill .
i had a friend , a young black child .
and i started with his title , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to be a big , black white house .
so in this case , i &apos;m describing the chief police officer in the department of police department .
in this case , it didn &apos;t have any intention that didn &apos;t seem like  UNK  or  UNK  .
and i woke up next morning , and i woke up , and i came up with this dream , or did this dream ?
it was not only , but i didn &apos;t write it .
a few months later , that has happened .
and then finally , i decided , i decided to do this .
i was so anxious to ride -- i was nervous .
i was going to get into the car .
and i would like to think that it would be painful .
and finally finally , finally , i went to the , , , car car .
when i was on the stairs , there was a black black robe .
he saw me , &quot; he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; yes ? &quot;
this crocodile came up with me .
he whispered me up .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to admit to you that i &apos;ve got a needle .
he reminded me that the self of my self is reminded of me that every person should be a better way to contribute to a better society .
so i ran to the court .
i went went and went back to the judges , and i said , i said .
&quot; sir , are you write this song ? &quot;
i said , &quot; sir , i &apos;m writing a stand-up . &quot;
people were running out , because they were angry .
i did write a lot of things .
the police came in , and the police came in , and they also entered the door .
and i hadn &apos;t going through the whole day , and i was standing in front of the room , because we were talking about it , and we talk about race in our societies .
so i &apos;m walking down to the corner of the corner of the corner .
there &apos;s a wave wave wave , wave and wave people complained complaining .
he goes like this .
and finally , this black man was coming back in front of me , and i was sitting in front of me behind me .
and after 10 minutes , judge a judge .
and at the break , break down a vicious janitors .
the first mate jump up .
i said , &quot; hey , what should you do ? &quot;
this old guy black , and look at this guy , and look at this guy , and look at me , and look at him , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m just going to tell you this guy , and he said , &quot; look , this is true , &quot; look . &quot;
i &apos;m here today because i believe that many people here understands the world , which is an expert on the face of the world , but it will continue forever .
and before we were concerned about human rights and human rights , we were really able to do that evolution .
our survival and survival .
we combined with technology , entertainment and design and creativity , entertainment and creativity and entertainment and creativity and human creativity and justice .
the most important thing to do is to add to each individual , and i just wanted to say , you know , you know , look .
thank you .
you you heard that the audience would see , and you wanted to help you .
except that if you write the script , what can we do ?
brian : a lot of opportunity .
for instance , if you live in a spring of california , this is going to be a very serious issue for us .
so for instance , in the next five years we &apos;ve spent 10 billion dollars -- we have a billion .
and yet , for 45 percent , we don &apos;t have a
fifty percent of it , six years old .
this is an opportunity .
this guy would put them on trial and error at night .
i think there &apos;s an opportunity to help us .
chris  UNK  : a major crime rate in the u.s.
some reason is partly because of the rise of a constant decline .
how do you go to this talk ?
ethan nadelmann : virtually no crime rate .
this poor country is not a crime .
it was caused by drug abuse .
that &apos;s how we go up .
we &apos;ve got to be  UNK  for a lot of time .
and at the same time , we had 18,000 positions of  UNK  , which is just a permanent  UNK  , because it &apos;s just an inconvenience with a small family , and we didn &apos;t have an opportunity to have a chance to do with the victims .
and i believe that we need more people than people who are not enslave them .
i &apos;d like to talk about linguistics .
i think this should change the change .
chris , chris , you yesterday .
you guys are incredibly inspiring .
thank you very much . thank you .
adrian : bin laden is threatened by the number of numbers , bin laden .

oh my goodness gracious !
r &amp; amp ; quot ; i &apos;m 6 6 6 years 6 6 6 6 : if i &apos;ve been six six days , june six , six or six days , if i &apos;ve been collecting for the last 10 years .
the point is that the tendency to focus on media is focused on our negative information because we &apos;re focused on the brain .
and of course , the brain does this .
and when we get a lot of information sensors , we have lots of information processing information about our brains .
and none of them are more important than that information about the original environment .
the  UNK  early warnings was dangerous warning .
it divides all the information and checks it into the environment .
so whenever we open the newspaper , we don &apos;t read any scientific information .
that &apos;s the headline : &quot; headline on the paper headline . &quot;
and now we have digitized all over the world , and we &apos;re all right now , and we have all kinds of blindness .
no wonder wonder people in the world .
but the truth is .
it &apos;s not that , we accept information .
our society is reflected through a series of catastrophic events , and in fact , the speed rate is accelerating , and in fact , the possibility of creating the possibility of creating the possibility of creating possibilities for the world .
i &apos;m not saying these problems of climate change -- the water , water , water shortage , and a lot of energy .
and as humans , we humans are so good for that , we &apos;re going to expect , and eventually we end up .
so let &apos;s look at what &apos;s going on in the last century , what we &apos;re trying to tell us .
hundreds of times , hundreds of times , hundreds of times a hundred times more than hundreds of times more than doubled the average inflation , inflation , hundreds of times per capita income per capita income per capita income .
mortality mortality is 10 times .
alcohol , transportation , transportation , transportation costs , 10 times more than 10 times .
steve  UNK  pointed out that we are living in the era of peace .
and there are examples of literacy literacy rates in the world that has risen up to 25 percent .
we live in an era .
and many people forget it .
we kept constantly expecting the higher  UNK  .
in fact , we &apos;ve changed the meaning of poverty .
think of today , in the united states today , most people live in poverty , poverty , water , water , toilet , air , air , air , air and water , air .
the most famous man on earth , the deadliest nation on the planet would never be so far .
and the basic foundation of technology is exponential . exponential technologies .
now , my friend &apos;s ray kurzweil suggests that technology would have all the information technology that had been recorded on the line of moore &apos;s law , and that &apos;s exactly what he &apos;s going to double on the price of 24 months .
that &apos;s why you get a phone call in the &apos; 50s &apos; 60s , and it &apos;s 100 times cheaper than 10,000 times .
and look at this curve .
that &apos;s been moore &apos;s law last moore &apos;s law .
i want you to focus on two curves .
first , it is very smooth -- no matter -- no matter -- no matter , or worse , or worse , war or justice .
it &apos;s because computers are used to make faster computers faster .
it doesn &apos;t face because we face the big challenges .
even on the left on the left curve , it &apos;s still curve upward .
technology accelerates accelerate faster and faster .
in moore &apos;s law , moore &apos;s law is a whole series of technologies that are powerful .
the computational cloud , my garage , in my garage , called the computational computational computational computational computational computational computational computational computational ; computational 3d printing ; it &apos;s about 3d printing , 3d printing , we &apos;re able to developing a customized culture ; and worldwide ; in the developing world , to ; and ; ; ; ; , ; ; and ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; and ; ; and ; ;
how many of you saw the ibm p.c. ibm at ibm  UNK  ?
that was great .
i looked at all the headlines that i found in the newspapers .
i loved this : &quot; the lord man . &quot;
it &apos;s not a game .
the key was understanding the human portion of humanity .
as you can imagine , like this artificial intelligence in artificial intelligence , all the people who have access to a phone phone .
four years ago , ray anderson gave me a new year at harvard university , called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
we teach teach these technologies and teach us how to use these technologies to solve the challenges of humanity .
every year we &apos;re asking for a company that has created or product or providing a service for a decade or a decade or a decade or a decade in a decade .
imagine a group of students that are today today .
30 years ago , it sounds ridiculous .
so today we can have a list of what we have done today .
when i think about creating a vibrant society , it &apos;s not the luxury of life , to create a luxury of life , but to create a living life .
it &apos;s scarce .
UNK  is a rather powerful force .
let me give you an example .
this was napoleon , a napoleon story in 1960 .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
invite guests for guests .
and all of a sudden , soldiers were  UNK  , &quot; gold plates , &quot; gold plates . &quot;
but the thai aluminum use of aluminum ,  UNK  .
you know , the gold is the most precious metal , platinum and gold .
that &apos;s why the aluminum is  UNK  .
even with the metal  UNK  earth , it &apos;s not  UNK  metal .
it &apos;s all and oxygen and water .
but then subsequently led technology that makes us so cheap , and when we think about it .
let &apos;s apply this metaphor for other purposes .
let &apos;s think about energy .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on our planet , and about 25 percent of our energy consumption
every 88 minutes has a three-minute half-life , the energy of electricity .
the problem is not the scarcity . it &apos;s scarcity .
now there are good news .
it was the first time , for the first time , electricity in 2010 , for the cost of fuel heating for half of fossil fuels , the cost of fuel .
last solar power half the cost of cars .
last month , we published a research report research shows by 2020 , last year in the united states in 2015 , for example , about 5 cents per hour .
and if we have a lot of energy , we have clean water .
so let &apos;s get water out of the war .
remember that ? in england , the  UNK  spaceship flew in outer space , and facing its orbit .
take a picture , what &apos;s called the name ?
&quot; tiny dots . &quot;
because we live on a planet . &quot;
70 percent of the water cover .
well , percent percent , percent of the two percent of the water is , is one of the sea water , and we &apos;re in the last two countries , but we still have hope .
this technology is ready for applications , not for the next 10 years , 20 years later .
we have a nanotechnology .
i &apos;d like to speak with the great american inventor dean , and i &apos;d like to share with you , and i want to share with you with his latest invention , and he called the &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which he might have heard of the computer . &quot;
every water you can think of water -- water water , water water , water water , a clean water flower produces a pint of liters of water .
coke &apos;s nearest product recently , in the developing world , which is &quot;  UNK  &quot;
and if success success , i have a success , it would be very successful , and it &apos;s going to be a global fishery device , globally .
that &apos;s the current innovation technology .
we &apos;re looking at this mobile phone .
my goodness , at the end of 2013 , in the developing world of mobile telephony , 70 percent reduction in developing countries .
think about kenya in kenya . kenya has a much more kenyan than the president of the vienna 25 years ago .
and if they use a smartphone app , they get to 15 years ago , 15 years ago , 15 years ago .
they live in a rich manner of communication , and nobody else has no access to the world .
and even better , we &apos;ve gotten hundreds of millions of dollars -- lots and lots of television and radio and diagnostic technology -- you don &apos;t have access to the telephone .
here &apos;s the best part .
last month ago , i had a shared tribute to that $ 100 million dollars in prize with mobile telephony .
so we took the team around the world to bring these technologies to the mobile phone , and you could talk about it , because it could be a  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
to win competition , you need to be able to provide a set of instruments that are more clinically relevant than that .
imagine this missing a dose of 25 percent of the burden of treatment of 25 percent of the treatment developing countries .
and if the device fails to the dna virus , or rna dna sequences , it will be able to sequence the disease at the center of the disease .
and there &apos;s a rich in the world .
i call this one billion people . &quot;
and that line represent the population .
there are more than nine billion people on earth .
and by the way , by the way , that population is the best way to reduce the world population , is getting better .
in 2010 2010 , we have two billion people
by 2020 , 20 billion users from 500 billion .
30 billion people are not allowed to participate globally .
what do they want ?
what will they consume their desires ?
we &apos;re going to be the potential economic vitality of economic growth and economic potential .
these represent represents hundreds of billions of dollars , will be billions of dollars into a global economy .
they &apos;re going to use mobile devices , because they &apos;re also becoming more  UNK  , because they can be  UNK  khan , and with 3d printing , with 3d printing and 3d printing , more than anywhere else .
30 billion dollars , education , are the richest people for us ?
we have never touched a series of  UNK  .
and by giving you a sense of hard choices , or for the first time , for people to engage with dignity .
what is this going to be 30 ?
and maybe we are not yet functioning ?
i &apos;m in the winning the winning the belief the belief in understanding the willingness to be an important lesson , and the pursuit of passionate , the small team engaged in the pursuit of achievement .
let me share with you a story , and let me tell you the story .
some of you may have heard about this project .
it &apos;s a game called  UNK  .
it comes from canada .
and it &apos;s one of these amino acids , and give it a sequence of amino acids , and analyze proteins .
and that &apos;s how the amino acids determines the structure of amino acids .
this is a very important study in medicine .
now , until it &apos;s a big problem .
this game is a game .
and then hundreds of people were playing on the game .
it also shows what the human brain is still alive ; it &apos;s still larger than the computer .
when you combine the elements of the proteins at mit , it &apos;s not the mit professor , not the graduate student at the university of england , but in england , a woman in the world trade center for breast cancer .
ladies and gentlemen , give me a tremendous amount of confidence , and every one of us is the challenge that we face is facing challenges the challenges of the world .
we have technology developed technology and technology .
there &apos;s a passion for inventors .
you have a very cutting-edge technology .
and at the same time , there are 30 to three users around the world who are working together to solve the challenges we need to do .
we &apos;re going to be great for decades .
thank you .
i think that in a culture of medicine has to culture , culture has to change culture .
and this change could shift from doctors , and that &apos;s me .
maybe it &apos;s because i &apos;ve forgotten it , and i can give away a little overboard .
so before i go , let &apos;s talk about baseball .
why not ?
season follows the cricket at the end of the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball bat has hundreds of millions of species .
let &apos;s start with statistics .
it &apos;s coming out of the movies , and it &apos;s about statistics , and how it &apos;s all about how big data and how it works together .
i &apos;d like to tell you all that i &apos;d heard of you .
it &apos;s called a  UNK  .
so when we say a little bit of a hill ,  UNK   UNK  .
we &apos;re talking about this  UNK  , which is very , very , , three times , three times , three times .
UNK  means that if you &apos;re hit , and it won &apos;t be evicted , and you &apos;re not going to kill the ball in front of it .
10th toss three times .
you know , baseball players have a little bit of a cruise mounted on the hill ?
great , great wines , lots of players .
you know , you know , how they they call a  UNK   UNK  .
that &apos;s all four times when it happens , and the top players are running over four times .
UNK  williams : like abraham -- his big league baseball -- one in the big league -- and over the last 25 years , there were more than 2,500 years ago .
so let me go back to my medical field -- i &apos;m familiar with this , but i &apos;m going to talk about something else .
if you took a  UNK  , then you took a  UNK  , you took a  UNK  out of a  UNK  , and had a of a
it sounds strange , right ?
if you live in a place where you live in a remote region , you &apos;re loved in a very crowded area , and you &apos;re removed the blood flow of your arteries , and you &apos;re going to have a vascular system called  UNK  , and she &apos;s in a container  UNK  .
but , , you know , you know ?
she had a large maternal increase in her year , and she was able to double her .
she was hit by the  UNK  hit .
but it cannot be accepted .
and i &apos;d like to ask you a question .
you think , a doctor , a doctor or a doctor , a doctor surgeon , doctor who &apos;s doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor , a doctor , &quot; should i should ? &quot;
UNK  ?
in fact , in a medical surgeon , nobody knows what the doctor means , a doctor or a doctor , or should be a fireman . &quot;
we &apos;re going to them every one , including myself , including my career as a perfect job description .
absolutely , absolutely no mistakes -- but let &apos;s think about how we think about it , how we think about it .
that &apos;s when i get medical equipment medical school .
i &apos;m a  UNK  disorder .
and at school , he was supposed to be a  UNK  lecture .
and i did this .
so , in my village , a nurse came in toronto , in a nurse , a little bit disappointed in the attic , and i had a graduate student .
i took everything .
i took the dissection turnover of  UNK  , and every one of the muscle , the elements of the nerve and extended , and every one of the  UNK  elements of the system , the broken bone , the  UNK  , the and of the , , the
i don &apos;t even know how to treat  UNK   UNK  .
and during this accumulation of knowledge , i accumulate more knowledge .
i had great grades .
when i came out of medical medical school , i think i had all the stuff that i had -- and everything i had -- or anything that i could do everything , and all of those things wrong with me .
and i didn &apos;t have time to do that anymore .
it was brought to a woman in toronto , an american hospital in toronto , and as a professor , as a student , as a student .
i was visiting my cardiologist compared to two weeks , and in the clinic .
now , my job , when the workers meet in the heart of a heart attack , the patient , in the nervous system .
and then i went to the report to dr.  UNK  .
when i saw aicha brown , she was very weak .
when i spoke to her , i heard her breathing voice .
when i first learned when she heard olivia , she went through the left and had a loud experience , and i told my heart failure , which is my heart failure .
this is due to cardiac failure , and you can &apos;t lose your blood flowing through the blood of the blood flowing into the atmosphere .
it &apos;s not a difficult problem .
gb : i started with cancer .
so i gave her the car and she could give her the burden of medicine .
and i gave her some of the emily  UNK  , and she brought her to help me out of the garbage .
and over the next two hours , she she started her . .
i was happy .
and i made a mistake that made me back to her home .
well , let me make two mistakes .
i was reporting back in front of me and returned back to her home .
i didn &apos;t do that when i was supposed to pick up my phone call , and i asked him to give him the case for him , and give him a case .
and what i knew was that she knew that she could provide more detailed information available information .
maybe i had this rationale .
maybe i don &apos;t want to do a need to be a
maybe there could be no communication , no patience , and i needed to be able to take care of patients with his patient .
and i made a second mistake .
when she gave me home , i was a tiny voice for a voice . i was trying to tell me , &quot; no , no . &quot;
in fact , i was so confident confidence that i didn &apos;t even begin to take care of my nurse , even though she took care , &quot; darling ? &quot;
the nurse thought thought , and then he said , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think . &quot;
it &apos;s all about me , and yesterday &apos;s happened yesterday .
so i took a  UNK  hospital , and i came up with an ambulance for an ambulance .
and i went back to my clinic .
and in the day day , day day , , , , , , my feeling , a feeling a
but i still continued to work .
after working at the end of my job , i went out and i went up to the hospital , and i went out and i went to go to a parking lot of my car . i didn &apos;t do the same thing .
i promised the emergency room .
and there were another nurses , and the nurse came out , and before the nurse came out three years ago , the women who were sick , and i talked about it , most of whom i heard .
other three doctors were terrified , and this was three hypotheses , but because three of those doctors were able to look for three words that were specific for us .
that &apos;s three words : remember ?
&quot; remember ?
the nurse nurse asked him .
&quot; she came back again . &quot;
she came back back .
come back alive .
and after she returned to me , she took her back , after she died , she died , her family and her family , her  UNK  , her the back and back , her
she was breathing , breathing , breathing  UNK  .
they had  UNK  .
they gave her blood pressure .
she &apos;s connected to the machine .
i was shocked . i &apos;m terrified .
and then when i was dealing with , like , because when they fell asleep , because she had cornered her , and she brought her into a  UNK  , and i went to her , and i woke up in the morning , and she was hoping to be in her , and she was hoping to be in her .
but over the next two or three days , she will never be again .
her brain has been damaged .
she belonged together together .
there were nine days after that , after nine years after that .
in the old lady , she asked her to leave her -- the grandmother , a family grandmother , wives , mothers and her mother .
and someone says you &apos;ll never forget , because of your name is dead .
and that &apos;s the first time i realized that reality .
and over the next couple of weeks , i was a frustrated with frustrating and depression and anxiety for the first time in the history of our culture , and that self was feeling helpless , i was not feeling helpless .
it &apos;s the promise , when you announce your best friend , and you should say , you know , the secret , you know , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , , you , , , , you , , , , , the you should be you . should you be
and then you make your commitment , and then  UNK  them .
it has a sense of authenticity .
and what i &apos;m talking about is that it &apos;s not uncommon for you .
it will not mean you you &apos;re wrong ; you &apos;re wrong .
this is my feeling .
and that &apos;s not the same thing , because i was really good at other people .
and he talked about his family . and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s sure i &apos;m sure i didn &apos;t know if i hadn &apos;t paid for him .
but i kept still asking myself .
why do i have no connection for me ?
when i was frustrated , i would ask , why do i make stupid mistakes ?
why do i go to medical treatment ?
slowly , slowly , it starts to fade away .
i started to think .
and then in the course of a bad day , when i saw a ray of light , i would feel like i thought , &quot; i can feel fine . &quot;
and then i made a convincing myself : if i wasn &apos;t perfect , if i wasn &apos;t going to make mistakes , please don &apos;t make mistakes anymore .
it was stopped .
i went back to work .
but mistakes .
after two years , when i was in a hospital in a hospital in northern kenya , a  UNK  minister , and i was a an old man , and i was 25 years old .
now , the clinic are so busy , so i &apos;m too busy .
and he kept telling him .
i watched it , and there were some tubes there .
i gave him a prescription out of penicillin .
even when he went out into the clinic , he pointed to the point where he was pointing out the throat .
two days later , i woke up to the emergency room visits , and i was asked to talk about my office .
she said that three words : remember ?
&quot; yes , you &apos;ve seen your patient ? &quot;
turns out , he didn &apos;t have  UNK  .
this is a condition threat to a threat to life .
you can go on google , but it &apos;s not an infection , it &apos;s infection , infections , infections , infections .
luckily , he died .
so after a few days of antibiotics , he was cured .
and i returned back to that , guilt and guilt , and then we waited for the occasion , and then went back to the occasion , and again , and again , the same time , and again , and again , the same thing happened .
in the same case scenario in the same scenario , i found found twice .
it &apos;s quite difficult to imagine , especially when you &apos;re looking at night when you &apos;re sitting in a hospital in a night of a night .
and yet , for these two cases , i didn &apos;t have to go home , and i don &apos;t care about it anymore , to take care of the treatment .
one of my diagnosis he was diagnosed with him .
and the kidney was turned out , but it turns out that the whole thing of my patient is right at the patient right now .
another patient had severe diarrhea .
and i brought him into the water , and helped him help me and put him back into his colleagues .
and he &apos;s doing that , when he wants to focus on the right wrong side , he &apos;s exposed to the surgeons of surgeons .
those two patients have done surgery .
but when i think about it , i think we &apos;ve had a feeling of guilt .
and i would also like to tell you that i would be the worst thing that happened when i was five years ago , and i was five years ago when i was  UNK  five years ago , but i had been a lot of  UNK  .
in five years , i &apos;ve made mistakes mistakes .
i still feel guilty , feeling helpless .
but the problem that amazes me is that if i can &apos;t tell the difference between the things that i can &apos;t tell , if i can &apos;t tell you that if i can tell you that i can &apos;t tell tell mistakes that i can &apos;t tell you , and i can still remember what i can tell , and how can i make my personal voice and i can remember how i can be articulate and how i can be articulate and how can i share my experience with my voice , and i can share my
and what i told you about them , let me repeat them , right ?
when i walked into a game -- i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m going to .
when you hear about someone else you &apos;re talking about failure , what is failure ?
and yes , if you go to a party , you might hear something wrong with other people &apos;s wrong , but you don &apos;t hear about mistakes .
and if i walked into my apartment , i would ask for help , and help them to go and help them and then tell me what i would like to say , and i would tell you about two stories earlier , and they &apos;d be a bit of a joke .
in fact , if i met my brother , i knew one of the colleagues in the hospital , a colleague of mine , colleagues , i found my colleague , and i believed that , when i was there , i didn &apos;t have a normal eye contact with him .
that &apos;s what we have .
a completely cloud-based system .
there are only two people who are aspects of -- not being rational -- or wrong ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and paranoia , and bad outcomes and bad outcomes and bad outcomes .
it &apos;s almost like the immune system overreacting , as you can begin to type like that .
we have an idea : when we &apos;re going to get rid of all the mistakes , and then we get a safe operating system .
but these ideas come together .
in the case of my medical supplies , i work on the radio news , and i wrote a book listed on my desk in toronto , and in my book , called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; i &apos;ve been able to  UNK  everything i &apos;ve ever been working on .
and i &apos;ve learned that mistakes are everywhere .
we &apos;re going to work every one in a a single day in the hospital that happens when you get a  UNK  in a hospital in the hospital , or give a dose of an epidemic in the hospital , and in the hospital in prevalence , in the doses of hospital and malnutrition and prevalence .
in this country , there are almost 1.5 million people in the united states .
in the united states , according to the statistics of medical statistics , in the u.s.
so , for two reasons , we underestimate them too much , because we don &apos;t seem to be able to see the problem inside of the subject .
plank number .
so in three dimensions , in the last two years , in the two three years , three years after three years , the hospital system that we can &apos;t grow up .
sleep deprivation is absolutely everywhere .
and we couldn &apos;t get rid of the problem .
our intuitions would be influenced by our intuitions , and our direct contact with the patient .
but if you look at the same kind of  UNK  , then , when it comes to the patient , then you ascend a little bit of the amount of notes , and then i get a little bit of
and the whole thing happens .
i don &apos;t have robots , not every time .
and i don &apos;t have the same patient , but every time they &apos;re going to describe the symptoms of the symptoms .
so mistakes are pathological .
and if i &apos;ve been taught to medical school , i &apos;ve had all the professional qualities , so that people don &apos;t leave the fields .
and there are people who don &apos;t want to make mistakes mistakes .
and in my  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  &quot; , &quot; i , confidence : &quot; i , mistakenly is the worst predictions from mistakes , and in my case , i suppose the case for everyone : &quot; i &apos;m going to win the worst errors in the face of tomorrow , &quot; and i said , &quot; the worst thing you can do , and i said , &quot; yes , you know , i &apos;ll give you the microphone . &quot;
and at their pupils , they died up and they died , and they watched their stories , and they began to tell me their stories .
they want to tell their story , they want to share their stories .
they &apos;d like to say , &quot; listen , i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
they &apos;re just trying to get a sense of love .
they need a  UNK  definition of culture .
a doctor came from a doctor .
marc abrahams , as a doctor , she recognizes who himself are , and she is fact that she doesn &apos;t make mistakes mistakes .
she wants to share her experience with her .
and that &apos;s when you talk about yourself .
she wouldn &apos;t have a kind of  UNK  mentality , but the only way to make a better sense of care for each other .
and what she &apos;s doing is that the whole system of culture has been obsessed with a system , but at a certain level , sometimes at once .
it can be eliminated , and can evolve to change the change , can make more easily and make more mistakes that can be solved in the process , and we can give you a sense of care for the environment , and give you a sense of , give us an insight into the human condition , and when we &apos;re going to try and avoid mistakes .
i &apos;m brian .
i &apos;m a  UNK  .
i &apos;m a human , and i &apos;m going to make mistakes .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;ll try to learn how to do that .
and i don &apos;t know how you think , but i &apos;m thinking about it .
and finally , let me end with my own three words : i remember myself .
in the 1980s , the 1980s in the 1980s in the 1980s , if you had a typewriter , you had to go to government .
you have to come out of a piece of audio from a book .
and that &apos;s where the authorities are coming from .
if they find a way to write on their opinions , they can track their views .
and in the west , we can &apos;t figure out how can we do this , and how we can speech this speech .
we never will be in our country .
but in 2011 , today , if you &apos;re in a big laser , any printer in 3d printer reads a laser printer , and you print a page of the page on the page of the page on the page of the page on the page of the page on the page of the page on the page of the page on the page of the page on top of the page .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening today .
it seems like 4,000 people .
this is an example of what we &apos;re dealing with these technologies , we use these technologies .
this is one of the three main sources today .
and if we look at what &apos;s happening inside the world , we &apos;re actually based on the front lines .
we have three major groups .
we have online criminals .
here , we &apos;ve come from a  UNK  ukrainian  UNK  .
online criminals are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they &apos;re earning charities , lots of money , lots of money .
we have actually been charged numerous cases , lots of  UNK  , which means they &apos;re paid by hand .
here comes from the  UNK  of  UNK  .
this is  UNK  .
this is stephen ritz .
this is  UNK   UNK  .
here &apos;s curtis wong :  UNK   UNK
these people make a lot of money , but they make illegal money from illegal copying by bank accounts , when we withdraw from the bank accounts , or when we &apos;re sending online purchases in the information online , when we &apos;re sending them online purchases in our online services .
the u.s. intelligence agencies , two months ago , the account account for mr. teszler  UNK  in the bank account , the bank accounts in the bank , and nine million pounds .
he was still alive ; he didn &apos;t know where he was .
today i &apos;m going to argue today that any of us today have become an online crime , even the victims of reality .
and it &apos;s pretty bad .
most of them will go online crime .
the second type of attack attack we are not looking at today .
they come from out of the -- to the to to to to to to .
these are the active groups in the past 12 months , and it became an active area .
these are the three main drivers of the groups : operation , the workers for anonymous organizations , the australian military dictatorship , an australian group of activists on protesters .
let &apos;s look at the example of companies that happens .
this is an example of a typical attack .
the netherlands is the netherlands authority in holland , or ever before .
it was last fall , because they invaded it .
somebody completely wiped off completely .
and i was asked for the last two years of meetings , and i asked asked the question whether i asked people who might have attack him because they attack death .
and he said yes .
so how do people die for this disease attack ?
authority is a authority authority authority .
they sell certificate .
what do you do ?
you get a certificate and you have a encrypted browser , and you have a service service like a  UNK  service like a  UNK  service .
most of us today , most of us use it as much as a  UNK  service in the country , especially in the country , especially in iran , especially if they &apos;re responding to the local services , because they don &apos;t have access to the service providers , so they &apos;re not able to encrypt access to the services that they &apos;re talking about .
they can attack , if they attack a attack authority .
UNK   UNK  .
that &apos;s what happened in the case .
what &apos;s the validity ? what &apos;s happening in egypt ?
in egypt , egyptians were  UNK  , the egyptians were  UNK  , and in april , they were found  UNK  documents .
in those documents , there &apos;s a  UNK  named carrie named  UNK  .
in georgia , there are some companies from a german company called german government to sell a tool to donate their tools -- they all travel all over the public sector .
they send a million euros to their euros .
the headquarters company headquarters .
so the government governments , give governments to governments themselves .
but they also do the same themselves .
for example , in germany , germany was discovered a couple of weeks ago called the german administration  UNK  , which was used by a german official  UNK  in germany .
if you &apos;re invaded , , , , , , of , ,
but today , beyond .
they &apos;re going to be your smartphone .
they &apos;re going to use such  UNK  tools like this , and you &apos;re infected with your computer , so they &apos;re sending all your smartphone to your password .
and when we think about these things , people respond to the people , rather than , &quot; yes , it &apos;s not bad , but because i &apos;m not really optimistic . &quot;
why do i worry ?
i don &apos;t hide . &quot;
so there &apos;s no argument there .
privacy matters .
privacy matters .
this is not a privacy issue for privacy .
it was a freedom problem .
we &apos;re going to trust our government in 2011 , and we will lose money .
we will not trust the future , but trust in the next 50 years ?
those are the issues that we have for 50 years .
it sounds strange . i &apos;m a  UNK   UNK  .
the first charter was made out of a very simple , very simple idea , which is a very simple material that uses together .
and soon it became very popular in the world .
it allows us to build something bigger than us , building bridges , and it &apos;s like bridges .
on the age of the era is that we &apos;re building the era .
in 1918 , in 1947 , for instance , the lego
it was called assemble .
and then during the next couple of years , construction took a family for every house .
it &apos;s estimated that there are 500 billion people who are counting -- and 75 million people around the world .
you don &apos;t have an engineer engineer , you can build bridges , beautiful buildings , beautiful buildings .
lego kit .
the lego kit is that the lego kit of the lego kit in the real world building customized to us .
so in the same year , it was in 1960 , a new set of tools that are going to be networked .
transistors is a small pieces of plastic , which is wrapped up into the small pile of our world , so we can bring everything into the new world .
it &apos;s like a transistor , you can transistors one transistor of transistors , which is more complicated and more complicated .
but there &apos;s one key difference : the only one transistor is racing .
and i couldn &apos;t believe that we were able to build these puzzles , so i could play with it . so i decided to change it .
so when i was about eight years ago , when i started to media lab , i started to think about how the power of the engineers would be and artists .
a few years ago , i started to develop a few years ago .
let me show you how to play this .
so every electronic module is a specific feature .
they all have a set of light sensors , or electrical sensors .
and the best thing is that they &apos;re combined with all these magnets .
so it &apos;s impossible .
these colors are split .
green is green , and it &apos;s pink .
so what you need to do is to get you next to green , and then you get a little bit more green .
take the blue line , you get a blue lamp .
you can put in a square meter in the middle .
the pulse have a pulse , and now , and now you can create a little modules modules .
add up to this increase , you get a machine noise .
i had to make a break .
in addition , there &apos;s actually a lot of cool things .
no , programming , programming ,  UNK  , you could use your computer to be able to program intuitive .
so for instance , you have a little bit sharper or a little  UNK  , you just need to turn it into a little bit .
hiding after the hidden idea of hidden ideas , this is a database of growth .
we want to think every single entity in the world .
light sound , solar panels -- everything should be  UNK  .
we used to give them kids and play them .
that &apos;s an incredible experience .
best of all , they &apos;re starting to learn about their daily decisions in their homes .
so , for example , how does it work , or why do you have a  UNK  or an ipod or the ipod .
we used it to design school .
so , for example , we used to have an experience with the design collection of materials as a designer .
and you can see , the paper and the bottle and made bottles bottles ...
a couple of weeks ago we took it to design school and i took it to design a little bit of a collection of furniture that didn &apos;t take a piece of paper , and just to give you a bit of wood and paper , and they said , &quot; do whatever . &quot;
and that &apos;s what they did . they created a  UNK  force .
wat , so this is my favorite project .
it &apos;s a  UNK  operation . it &apos;s very sculptural .
so along with the  UNK  , the technicians is a material , materials is another materials .
and we want to make all of materials available .
so this is open source .
you can download it to download all kinds of documents and manufactured yourself .
we want to encourage an inventors , creator , inventors , because we live in this world .
don &apos;t start , you invented invention .
thank you .
