so that &apos;s what we did here . you see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . that &apos;s what we know from practice .
we &apos;re working with local communities .
this is where people were handing them in , and i was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start  UNK  them .
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
so we can create the community where we have  UNK  who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; what do you need ?
you can see all of this .
some i even considered like my second home .
she said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
all right .
i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist &apos;s clinic to do it .
i worked for an italian ngo , and every single project that we set up in africa failed .
her name was joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
thanks , tom .
we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
well you can see where this is going .
and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
so i said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .
so what that means is that people will be able to â€” people will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
we hide in dark , windowless rooms , and generally avoid sunlight .
you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
the dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
and the  UNK  said , &quot; yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot;
this strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient egypt or  UNK  &apos;s  UNK  .
thing is , it &apos;s owned by the city .
he needed them to feel protected .
the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in america .
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
UNK  thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
and i see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
your money can be stolen . you can be forced to leave your home during a war .
can they really store all this information about us ?
and after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
i can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how i left north korea , but i only can say that during the ugly years of the famine i was sent to china to live with distant relatives .
then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
we say , &quot; it &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . &quot;
and i &apos;m insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day .
well , to conclude , i can say that we made a material using steel fibers , the addition of steel fibers , using  UNK  energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks .
we need to work with governments in regional levels .
so i figured that the problem is the solution .
so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
so these  UNK  tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non-invasive .
i have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
however , bit by bit , the euphoria of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was fading out -- for every day we were waking up to the news of violence .
the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son &apos;s 14th birthday .
so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture .
with  UNK  and  UNK  , we &apos;re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
thank you .
i use the garden , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my  UNK  for that cloth .
thank you .
this is six months of my life , into this file .
and if i could communicate just one thing to  UNK  and to sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
so i had an idea .
i had my first apartment , my first little green american express card , and i had a very big secret .
you &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
i am on this stage because i am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
absolutely .
and of course , everything in africa grew beautifully .
but &quot; how many times will i get stopped ? when will i get stopped ? &quot;
i had only one way out : the stairs from where i &apos;d come in .
you know ? you can be anything .
now , it wasn &apos;t until this point that i realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt .
i want to make them public .
but when none of this is presented to them , if they &apos;re not shown how food affects the mind and the body , they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
it &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you .
when these villagers claimed their freedom , the  UNK  burned down all of their houses .
and i asked them once , and i asked them again , and i got no real answer . it was only blah blah answers .
the solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt .
so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
so the city planners , they get together and they figure they &apos;re going to change the name south central to make it represent something else , so they change it to south los angeles , like this is going to fix what &apos;s really going wrong in the city .
in turn , the word &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is known in all abrahamic traditions , has the same root in arabic as the word &quot;  UNK  &quot; -- womb --  UNK  the maternal feminine  UNK  all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have  UNK  from .
kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
am i south korean or north korean ?
you already tried it once , right , and you -- i tried it before , but i stopped because it gave me a shock .
after six months in japan , 1,100 volunteers had passed through all hands , hundreds of whom had helped us  UNK  over  UNK  photographs , the large majority a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
it also has  UNK  , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that  UNK  can occur .
i was 22 , and in the united states , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners ,  UNK  , and husbands in the united states .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
you never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
i truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
and so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me .
each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
as i looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the processing lab , i couldn &apos;t help but think as a  UNK  that i could fix that tear and mend that scratch , and i knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
&quot; just in the nick of time to save the  UNK  people from starvation . &quot;
across the globe , throughout the ages , our basic needs are just the same , aren &apos;t they ? &quot;
and the garden , it was beautiful .
so i put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks .
this morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; can we -- can you imagine a city that is not  UNK  ? &quot;
so with help from old and new friends , i turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant  UNK  and  UNK  it with a  UNK  sentence : &quot; before i die , i want to ... &quot; so anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
they &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .
he didn &apos;t want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me whatsoever .
and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
so i got an old car battery , an indicator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps  UNK  when they want to turn right or left . it  UNK  .
thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
you have to create a new profession .
and i will talk about this .
i mean , come on , why wouldn &apos;t they ?
we western people are  UNK  ,  UNK  missionaries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : we either  UNK  them , or we are  UNK  .
so i think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering .
actually , it still has to cool down first before i can show you that the healing works .
and i was like , &quot; cool . bring it . &quot;
he shares it  UNK  and he shares it regardless .
because it turns out that i &apos;m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
when you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they don &apos;t have to do it .
when i was researching this talk , i found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the united states , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
thank you .
they were already drowning in manure .
i &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
and on the  UNK  , this was on .
when i was 11 , i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
nairobi national park is not  UNK  in the south widely , which means wild animals like  UNK  migrate out of the park freely .
i &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so i want to help give aspiring north koreans a chance to prosper with international support .
and this information is stored for at least six months in europe , up to two years .
that &apos;s why i am a global ambassador for  UNK  , a global campaign to educate women .
and i got a switch where i can switch on the lights , on and off .
that &apos;s just how i felt as i had those conversations with the students . i was amazed at the ideas that they had , and i wanted others to experience this wonderland as well .
i was able to leave , because of one final ,  UNK  beating that broke through my denial .
gardening is my graffiti . i grow my art .
in india and nepal , i was introduced to the brick  UNK  .
i find that americans see the fragility in changes .
but what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
just go and read her book .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
he did this especially at the beginning by  UNK  me .
here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change .
UNK  also have tremendous historical significance .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
photography has been my passion ever since i was old enough to pick up a camera , but today i want to share with you the 15 most  UNK  photos of mine , and i didn &apos;t take any of them .
and of course ,  UNK  surgery , or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and  UNK  , has a huge impact on our lives .
so i broke the silence .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
i also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
&quot; i &apos;m helping the north korean people . &quot;
you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red , overnight , some 200  UNK  came out from the river and they ate everything .
we happened to be back in new york exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as i drove down the highway , poured coffee  UNK  on my head as i dressed for a job interview , i never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
he doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : he has never told a lie .
and every day , every day we wake up with the rule of the  UNK  and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law .
and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and excite us about your content .
we started dating , and he loved everything about me , that i was smart , that i &apos;d gone to harvard , that i was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job .
the reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting poisoned is because there &apos;s  UNK  conflicts . the  UNK  communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the  UNK  are falling victim to this .
thanks so much . max little , everybody .
the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
it &apos;s everywhere .
that &apos;s why i  UNK   UNK  , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
how can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
we &apos;ve had , like , 50 people come to our  UNK  and participate , and it &apos;s all volunteers .
on may the 13th , i made my way to the town of  UNK  .
when i was a teenager , i was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; sorry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
for instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , beverly hills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
over time , more photos came in , thankfully , and more  UNK  were needed , and so i reached out again on facebook and linkedin , and within five days , 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
and i &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
and then a few days later , driving home from our  UNK  , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold big mac in my face .
and we said to the  UNK  , &quot; my god , the  UNK  ! &quot;
i was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and i got frustrated , and  UNK  used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that i could not breathe or scream , and he used the  UNK  to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
mercury is used in the extraction process .
these north koreans were not so lucky .
over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back , fully restored and  UNK  .
so i set up everything .
thank you .
i was helping clean the  UNK  , the communal  UNK  , the huge giant  UNK  .
you probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road .
not terribly damaged , but where the water had caused that  UNK  on the girl &apos;s face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy .
patronizing , i treat everybody from another culture as if they were my  UNK  .
a hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an american worker .
english was so important in south korea , so i had to start learning my third language .
this is what i looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier .
i was so scared , i thought my heart was going to explode .
we have zero infrastructure .
the next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
just like a graffiti artist , where they  UNK  walls , me , i beautiful lawns ,  UNK  .
this should be the first principle of aid .
you could not get a worse insult , and that from charles darwin .
they are constructions , and they are constructions by a group of professionals , by  UNK  and makeup artists and photographers and  UNK  and all of their assistants and  UNK  and  UNK  , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
we might produce the next george washington  UNK  .
and all over europe , people stood up and said , &quot; we don &apos;t want this . &quot;
and let that be your weapon of choice .
this is on the street for a reason .
so what is the problem with  UNK  ?
so a microwave is a similar system .
and you can even see how i go from  UNK  by train to  UNK  , and how often i call in between .
the man who i loved more than anybody on earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than i can even remember .
today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
that &apos;s why the white people in africa are called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; boss .
we need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
they &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in october and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
to me , afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of  UNK  remind me of that .
and now what she &apos;s looking at in new york are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in new york .
the smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . i call it a transformer .
i know we &apos;re getting personal , but i was a young girl .
so one night , i was walking around the  UNK  with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
there &apos;s another time when i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown los angeles .
UNK  can heat , especially steel ; it &apos;s very good at that .
he not only  UNK  about my college degree , but also that i was the first woman , and that i am the first woman to drive him through the streets of kabul .
with an amazing group of women , i  UNK  the  UNK  women &apos;s platform for peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the  UNK  empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
never the word &quot; i , &quot; and the word &quot; we &quot; 32 times .
after another two hours of hiking , the  UNK  trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people  UNK  .
it &apos;s very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos .
what we do , we work one-on-one , and to work one-on-one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
my story begins when i was in new york city for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we &apos;re on the corner of  UNK  and 5th .
here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and i are sitting here talking today , kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
so pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and  UNK  working .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
i see young people and they want to work , but they &apos;re in this thing where they &apos;re caught up -- i see kids of color and they &apos;re just on this track that &apos;s designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
but  UNK  and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
we did not prioritize right .
this picture is the very first picture that i ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that i had worn a  UNK  , and i didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
many north koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
and when we do this , who knows ?
they are far from being extinct .
in  UNK  , i was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
UNK  survivors as wonderful ,  UNK  people with full futures .
as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
this is where i live . i live in kenya , at the south parts of the nairobi national park .
i mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center  UNK  for them to  UNK  , and  UNK  on the ground helped them get a  UNK   UNK  of their own , so that now they do the same  UNK  work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
but then i said , i want to go out with this information .
instead , i stand here a proud graduate of  UNK  college .
also , asphalt can create a lot of noise .
the other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
they said , we don &apos;t want this data retention .
so , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it &apos;s not outdated .
if that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
and if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
and everyone was doing the same .
so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
local , passionate people . that &apos;s who you have  UNK  .
but then i said , i want to have this information , because this is my life you are  UNK  .
as i stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
so i asked my phone company ,  UNK   UNK  , which was at that time the largest phone company in germany , and i asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me .
but they mean two different things .
i am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind turbines do this to birds . they slice them in half .
they knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
it &apos;s tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
i hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
and this is how i decided to maintain it .
and i think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; if you are a little bit  UNK  and you have  UNK  hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot;
the exciting thing is that i see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
i met  UNK  on a cold , rainy january night .
my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
now i &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
as you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing north koreans to secretly cross .
there &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : none were started by one person .
like the others , i wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic ,  UNK  band , and i can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the  UNK  square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
but the second answer , and what i really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; why ?
the person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
he &apos;s  UNK  , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best  UNK  cannot .
within japan , by july , we &apos;d  UNK  out to the neighboring town of  UNK  , further north to a town called  UNK  .
so i want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
this is a blueprint how to survey your society , because you know who talks to whom , who sends whom an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
all this is possible with this information .
intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the &#91; aftermath &#93; of the revolution .
UNK  , i treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . &quot; i love you so much . &quot;
because there are no  UNK  , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of  UNK  dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have  UNK  dogs , you have a huge time bomb of  UNK  . the number of cases of  UNK  has increased tremendously in india .
they &apos;re our  UNK  and our histories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you &apos;d go back to look for .
i , along with hundreds of other volunteers , knew we couldn &apos;t just sit at home , so i decided to join them for three weeks .
i &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
so , well , i do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
i would like to conclude by reading an email i got from one of them ,  UNK  , the day i finally got back from japan after six months .
so one year ago , i was just a boy in the savanna  UNK   UNK  my father &apos;s cows , and i used to see planes flying over , and i told myself that one day , i &apos;ll be there inside .
so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the parkinson &apos;s voice initiative .
fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , i would be one of them .
so years and years ago , i had this idea : why don &apos;t we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why don &apos;t , for once , listen to them ? but not in community meetings .
the textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for cooking -- an  UNK  machine .
so what &apos;s being done ? well , we &apos;re conducting research on these birds . we &apos;re putting  UNK  on them .
we &apos;re talking to them about appreciating  UNK  , about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
thank you .
actually , for 10 years .
my friend got to come with me .
to me , this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : it &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an  UNK  .
they were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said : &quot; we don &apos;t want this . &quot;
extraordinary .
we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot .
the answer is easy .
i couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
i thought it was only us italians  UNK  around africa , but then i saw what the americans were doing , what the english were doing , what the french were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , i became quite proud of our project in zambia .
which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
they help to kill all the bacteria . they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals .
&quot; i &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
i joined forces with many other  UNK  inside and outside libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the  UNK  regime of  UNK  .
my family believes in me .
they &apos;d been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and  UNK  cards .
they clean up carcasses right to the bone .
as for me , i &apos;d have to wait until i got home to really feel my heartbreak .
so i &apos;m like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and i told them , you know , you don &apos;t have to do this like this .
that &apos;s a lot . almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
i was 22 . i had just graduated from harvard college .
we can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make  UNK  screening feasible for the first time .
because i want to show the people what does data retention mean .
sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
these heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing i wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india , and they have taken a stand .
today i am 22 .
it was the only way we both could be educated .
otherwise , that little girl isn &apos;t going to look like that little girl anymore , and surely that &apos;s as tragic as having the photo damaged .
the workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
afghanistan looks so different from here in america .
when i returned to afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
he sat next to me on the new york city subway , and he started chatting me up .
what we do , we &apos;re a  UNK  kind of group , where it &apos;s composed of gardeners from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it &apos;s completely volunteer , and everything we do is free .
so i grew up hating lions so much .
the profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
let &apos;s go back to that time , to this city .
i feel like every time someone  UNK  , new orleans has a parade .
because , you see , at least we fed the  UNK  .
after a period of 33 years in exile , i went back to libya , and with unique enthusiasm , i started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
the  UNK  are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
it was 7 a.m. i still had on my  UNK  .
in school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of kim  UNK  , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that america , south korea , japan are the enemies .
i remember looking into their tired ,  UNK  eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
we tend to stereotype victims as  UNK  headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods .
have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
one of them was this grandmother .
these miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of ghana .
many of them drown .
these girls were so lucky .
we had a victory on our hands .
a photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
that was awkward .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; come on , really ?
the kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the north korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we north korean people need .
anyone healthy or with parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and i &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
&quot; before i die , i want to sing for millions . &quot;
after we finished talking , i felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this  UNK  in my own lifetime , and i thought , if i don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
when charles darwin went across the atlantic in  UNK  on the  UNK  , he saw the turkey  UNK  , and he said , &quot; these are disgusting birds with bald  UNK  heads that are formed to  UNK  in  UNK  . &quot;
a conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
we made it all the way to the border of  UNK  , but i had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in  UNK  .
i am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the  UNK  list and the elections .
he had these big cheeks , these big apple cheeks and this  UNK  hair , and he seemed so sweet .
in tibetan culture , they are performing very important sky  UNK  . in places like tibet , there are no places to bury the dead , or wood to  UNK  them , so these  UNK  provide a natural disposal system .
and the indicator box makes the lights flash .
all this is possible with your mobile phone .
we &apos;re trying to determine their basic ecology , and see where they go .
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in  UNK  .
i made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and i made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including kazakhstan , south africa , australia , argentina and beyond .
in the cold , windy night .
so i was a little bit skeptical , what should i do with it ?
they &apos;ve also be associated with disney â€” â€”  UNK  as  UNK  , dumb , stupid characters .
we are the soil .
in my broken english , and with a dictionary , i explained the situation , and without  UNK  , the man went to the atm and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other north koreans to get out of jail .
and he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by  UNK  his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been  UNK  and repeatedly physically abused by his  UNK  , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
so the last question people ask me is , &quot; what is it like to be a model ? &quot;
they  UNK  me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty ,  UNK  fluorescent lit basement .
abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if i could put the lights for her .
the school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
did the  UNK  list and the  UNK  between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?
they have shown an  UNK  bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of  UNK  .
and i was very proud .
my  UNK  even called in and said how they endorse and love what we &apos;re doing .
what is it , then ?
my family was not poor , and myself , i had never experienced hunger .
the skeletal tree limbs submerged in lake volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to  UNK  the lines .
it made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why i do this , and people asked me , &quot; fin , aren &apos;t you afraid people are going to steal your food ? &quot;
okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; do you get free stuff ? &quot;
in a year , i had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , &quot; how can you do that ?
just like  UNK  million other americans , i live in a food desert , south central los angeles , home of the  UNK  and the  UNK  .
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
image is powerful , but also image is superficial .
i don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , i &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
what i will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me .
now , i cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where i &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
and when you &apos;re describing your science , beware of jargon .
you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
north koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
he kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
for the last 28 years , i &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 i had the great honor of being the sole  UNK  at the vancouver peace summit .
so green grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
tell us why your science is relevant to us .
so i am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what i do .
in our age of increasing distractions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
what is  UNK  ? you see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off .
we started talking about slavery , and really , i started learning about slavery , for i had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
also the noise will disappear in these pores .
at the end of my first week there , i found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town .
i started this as a  UNK  in  UNK  , in western australia .
instead , everything we touched we killed .
i always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
and when we &apos;re backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
i decided when i was 27 years old to only respond to people , and i invented a system called enterprise  UNK  , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
and still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
one time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a chinese police officer .
abuse thrives only in silence .
it &apos;s about all of us .
this is  UNK  . when his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
first of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
it happened twice more on the  UNK  .
for her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gift back to him , something he could look at again , something he remembered from before that wasn &apos;t still  UNK  from that day in march when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed .
almost 200 organizations were established in  UNK  during and immediately after the fall of  UNK  -- almost 300 in  UNK  .
tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic  UNK  , and the list can go on .
if kids grow  UNK  , kids eat  UNK  .
it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
thank you very much .
i hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and i hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of  UNK  can continue to live in the shadows .
saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the  UNK  when you grow up .
there were no windows large enough to climb through .
i didn &apos;t know he was  UNK  me .
so actually , i was in very good company .
as they had run from the wave , and for their lives , absolutely everything they had , everything had to be left behind .
&quot; we hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our  UNK  . &quot;
the first principle of aid is respect .
and i believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
these are the ideals that a war-torn libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace .
eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
my interpreter told me their stories .
if you have access to this information , you can control your society .
and how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant  UNK  , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
a real school .
i dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
i &apos;m rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
we want  UNK  in the digital age , and we don &apos;t want that phone companies and internet companies have to store all this information about us .
he doesn &apos;t remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my ipod , conversations we had when he was four ,  UNK  on my arm on the first ever episode of  UNK  , and lady gaga &apos;s birthday .
so i want us all to become  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  gardeners .
i would have told you myself that i was the last person on earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact i was a very typical victim because of my age .
so â€” â€” so the government says , &quot; do it again . &quot;
so what i want to do here , we gotta make this sexy .
i have that black lab , and i have that  UNK  .
i want them to take it , but at the same time , i want them to take back their health . &quot;
i have never , ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile : &quot; son , resist  UNK  . fight him .
we &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
since i was a small boy , i used to work in my room for the whole day , and i even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but i learned a lot about electronics .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
i &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in ghana .
i got a chance to come by plane for my first time for ted .
a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
but i struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
first , you have to offer them  UNK  .
you can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
thanks .
we tested a lot of specimens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s very interesting . we have to try that . &quot;
and i hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
what &apos;s the next one on your list ?
also , i realized there was a wide gap between north and south .
for elections did not bring peace and stability and security in libya .
i visited villages in india where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
now , all these photos had been damaged by water , submerged in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so  UNK  them was a huge part of the project .
i live in south central .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
we see vocal tremor , weakness and  UNK  .
you can give somebody an idea .
we pulled debris from canals and  UNK  .
the speech actually becomes quieter and more  UNK  after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
in fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here ,  UNK  with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
who calls whom ? who sends whom an email ?
but  UNK  , with parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no  UNK  , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test .
it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
he told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
&quot; the taliban are gone ! &quot; my father  UNK  .
that &apos;s enough space to plant  UNK  million tomato plants .
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
every 20 minutes , i &apos;d have to run back to our  UNK  to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as i sat there , i thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
UNK   UNK  . it means in my language , thank you very much .
it &apos;s made of asphalt , and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s raining a lot .
so l.a. times got  UNK  of it . steve  UNK  did a story on it and talked to the  UNK  , and one of the green grounds members , they put up a petition on  UNK  , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .
&quot; before i die , i want to be completely myself . &quot;
UNK  lived and  UNK  in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the smallest things , like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between .
i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
instead ,  UNK  came home one friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me , because i had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on wall street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in new england where he could start his life over with me by his side .
the book was published in 2009 .
for four decades  UNK  &apos;s  UNK  regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of  UNK  society .
it was very time-consuming .
you can see every step i take .
because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
and i was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
they are  UNK  machines .
a morning that i will never forget .
we are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot;
but it is not only about me .
so actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .
we had these magnificent tomatoes . in italy , a tomato would grow to this size . in zambia , to this size .
and i always just say , &quot; oh , i was  UNK  , &quot; but that means nothing .
you have to fight for it every day .
today i have just one request .
it &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
it manifests in each individual differently , hence why  UNK  is so different from sam .
we always wondered what they knew about us .
and , my favorite is ,  UNK  are better looking .
this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering .
why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion , by both men and women ?
hold it up .
i had moved to new york city for my first job as a writer and editor at  UNK  magazine .
who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
and it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
everything i do , and everything i do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in africa .
you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
these people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
please -- don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m normal .
i didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
it &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between north korea and south korea , so , ironically , i took a flight back to china and i headed toward the north korean border .
and here i am today .
it started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , i flew down to los angeles to meet with the director of free the slaves and offer them my help .
and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
thank you so much . thank you .
the next question people always ask me is , &quot; can i be a model when i grow up ? &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to hold her one more time . &quot;
people are dying from curable diseases in south central los angeles .
entrepreneurs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identified .
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a  UNK  inside .
even though i was really fortunate to get out , many other north koreans have not been so lucky .
they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south .
raw data .
you have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
if you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit .
i &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
we &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- carnegie ,  UNK  , edison , ford , all the new companies , google , yahoo .
and then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
it &apos;s really become sacred to us .
if anything seemed unnatural , i could be imprisoned and  UNK  .
UNK  was the symbol of the protector and the  UNK  , and together with the  UNK  , symbolized the unity between upper and lower egypt .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
we gotta flip the script on what a  UNK  is .
they were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for  UNK  .
so this is the specimen coming out now .
i met a very difficult environment in the  UNK  , an environment which was increasingly polarized , an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
my father was listening to bbc news on his small , gray radio .
yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
so we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab .
several times we can repeat that .
i got to climb out of that hole , and i got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
i live in new york , and last year , of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and  UNK  , 86 percent of them were black and latino , and most of them were young men .
yet beyond the  UNK  and the frustration and the never-ending  UNK  was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red  UNK  of the  UNK  store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
some north koreans in china seek asylum in foreign  UNK  , but many can be caught by the chinese police and  UNK  .
it &apos;s a porous asphalt , like i said , so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones .
since my family couldn &apos;t speak chinese , i had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in china and then into southeast asia .
on another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers .
that &apos;s the whole idea .
who sends whom a text message ?
and the  UNK  would have known who took part at this protest , and if the  UNK  would have known who are the leaders behind it , this may never have happened .
it &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
together we can make our beds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful  UNK  they should be .
but even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
&quot; oh , no , i cannot do this . &quot; &quot; would you like me to find you somebody ? &quot;
UNK  knows what love is .
there is a problem with community meetings .
i could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
is code for some people for , &quot; it &apos;s her fault for staying , &quot; as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us .
so why are  UNK  important ? first of all , they provide vital ecological services . they clean up .
every year , countless north koreans are caught in china and  UNK  to north korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
they will come the first day and they see the  UNK  , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
he kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
it could take an hour . it could take weeks .
the funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice  UNK  , and the client says , &quot; cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
when you walk out of this room , you will be informed about  UNK  , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighbors about  UNK  .
i even went through an identity crisis .
thank you .
take your science , subtract your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
&quot; before i die , i want to plant a tree . &quot;
he wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
guess what ?
so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
thank you .
but many die .
the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking i was walking around the  UNK  , but i was sleeping in my bed .
what i &apos;ve come to realize about afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the west , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
that was , i don &apos;t know what happened there .
it &apos;s about making space for reflection and contemplation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
this one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and i found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand .
were we being followed ?
you &apos;d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
ha . he &apos;s ready .
they &apos;re  UNK  cost , and we all know what happens .
UNK  first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
i shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
because in the mean time , the german constitutional court ruled that the implementation of this e.u. directive into german law was  UNK  .
so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when i grow up .
so i want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hesitate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; will you take our picture ? &quot;
and i figured , this has to stop .
one day , my worst nightmare came true , when i was caught by the chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
this young child is eight years old .
they are very graceful . charles darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies .
UNK  believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest  UNK  .
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it .
this is the  UNK  river , which serves as a part of the border between north korea and china .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early  UNK  of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at  UNK  out the  UNK  factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
i saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
i used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for the last little while i &apos;ve been a model .
and finally , this  UNK  can also lead to more and more damage .
as my team leader  UNK  once said , it &apos;s like doing a tattoo on someone .
but those guns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
i was so shocked .
see , i &apos;m an artist .
it &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .
i feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day , and forget what really matters to you .
areas like her husband and her face , which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix , we could just put them together in one good photo , and remake the whole photo .
but as these conversations unfolded , i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
when they came out of the shaft , they were  UNK  wet from their own sweat .
this directive says that each phone company in europe , each internet service company all over europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users .
and i thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time i &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
and so just as the womb entirely  UNK  the embryo , which grows within it , the divine matrix of compassion  UNK  the entire existence .
there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . foxp2 , for example .
the neurologist &apos;s test is non-invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were  UNK  in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the  UNK   UNK  to trucks hundreds of yards away .
from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it  UNK  , and just as the limbs are affected in parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
and my idea is also being used now all over kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
i was a doing a ph.d. at the time , trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do .
there she is .
due to  UNK  , due to  UNK  light , due to  UNK  , this binder , this  UNK  , the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink , and if it  UNK  , it gets  UNK  , and it  UNK  from the aggregates .
i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
for as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the  UNK  has nothing left to lose .
it &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on lake volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
so what we can do is use steel wool just to clean  UNK  , and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces , and these very small pieces we can mix to the  UNK  .
my next invention is , i want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
the two words come from the latin root &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
UNK  is 22 , tall and very handsome .
don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
you don &apos;t get a chance to mess it up .
we activate communities .
we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
he had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
you could be the president of the united states , or the inventor of the next internet , or a ninja  UNK  surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
the most important thing is passion .
there were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe  UNK  made  UNK  pretty much inconsequential .
children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a resume and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the president of the united states , but your resume reads , &quot; underwear model : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look .
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived .
so i was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and i would be  UNK  to a horrible fate back in north korea .
many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold ,  UNK  in water poisoned by mercury .
oddly , i had been to many of these places before .
plus i got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn &apos;t  UNK  with pesticides .
approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; hey , why don &apos;t you take  UNK  back to new york and make it a father-daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;
there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing  UNK  of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
see , i have a legacy in south central .
it &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
because it &apos;s very hollow , all the noise will disappear , so it &apos;s a very silent road .
and first , i  UNK  you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
my community , the maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for  UNK  them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
we couldn &apos;t  UNK  the photo unless it was cleaned , dry and reclaimed .
despite what had happened , i was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because i loved him , and he loved me so much .
that &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , i decided to risk going to south korea , and i started a new life yet again .
if they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
as we started down the path , we pushed aside the  UNK  blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so i  UNK  the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
so he jumps in and kills the animals .
and in the aftermath , also not the fall of the iron curtain .
he &apos;s not greedy . he doesn &apos;t see skin color .
when something becomes  UNK  cost , it becomes massively scalable .
but when i am back in afghanistan , when i see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , i see a promising future and lasting change .
normality  UNK  the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
so they kill the lions .
there were no art directors , no  UNK  , no chance for  UNK  , not even any regard for lighting .
however ,  UNK  left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds of  UNK  .
back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
but you have to maintain it .
it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
these are  UNK  lines of information .
thank you .
for weeks , all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things .
you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
from time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because taliban were suspicious .
peter  UNK  , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
&quot; before i die , i want to straddle the international date line . &quot;
so these photos are far more than  UNK  for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
in the trenches . richard  UNK  , you are something else .
growing your own food is like printing your own money .
a lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an  UNK  child in her arms just stared  UNK  at his mother &apos;s face .
the time it took , however , to get it back is a completely different story , and it depended obviously on the damage involved .
i live near this house , and i thought about how i could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood , and i also thought about something that changed my life forever .
they &apos;re high-speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
so for the next five years , i dressed as a boy to  UNK  my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
first you get one stone , then several more , and more and more and more and more , and then they -- well , i will not do that .
so i had to find a way of solving this problem .
and the trick here is to use a single ,  UNK  sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine .
the older ladies sometimes hadn &apos;t seen a scanner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scanned , uploaded to a cloud server , it would be downloaded by a  UNK  , a stranger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it &apos;d start being fixed .
at the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
when i was seven years old , i saw my first public execution , but i thought my life in north korea was normal .
i &apos;m here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer .
and i discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
no expensive staff time required .
no , it didn &apos;t .
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
so i didn &apos;t give up . i continued .
but they can damage your windshield , so you &apos;re not happy with that .
yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
if you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where i lived , what jobs i took , who my friends were and where i spent christmas , i would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in  UNK  at the beginning .
when i was working in the field , i brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , i  UNK  to the people i was photographing that i wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , i made these images .
i was just three years old when my brother came along , and i was so excited that i had a new being in my life .
i &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
this directive &#91; is &#93; called data retention directive .
and i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some  UNK  who are , like , &quot; wait . naomi .  UNK  . joan  UNK  . liu  UNK  . &quot;
during this time , we hadn &apos;t really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was printer inks .
we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
i met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
and i feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because i should not have worn this dress .
i &apos;m a child of 1984 , and i live in the city of berlin .
you just couldn &apos;t imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
and with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to  UNK  and become famous .
we take photos constantly .
but since publishing &quot; crazy love , &quot; i have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an  UNK  life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives --  UNK  , happy lives -- as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
and so what i did in  UNK  that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days i had my first client , and i helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a  UNK  guy , and i helped him to sell to the restaurant in  UNK  , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; you the guy who helped  UNK  ? can you help us ? &quot;
that &apos;s the real  UNK  .
and i am on this stage because i am a model .
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
but nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
we victims need everyone .
the project &apos;s also made a big difference in the lives of the  UNK  .
we need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
and here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of berlin and said , &quot; freedom , not fear . &quot;
why in the hell would they not okay this ?
i thought , age 21 , that we italians were good people and we were doing good work in africa .
in hindu mythology ,  UNK  was the  UNK  god , and he risked his life in order to save the goddess  UNK  from the  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
and i helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the  UNK  in  UNK  for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; hey , you helped them . can you help us ? &quot;
they are hardly  UNK  .
i did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the south korean embassy .
i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
however , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine  UNK  .
they want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
so we still have the specimen here . it &apos;s quite warm .
i thanked him with all my heart , and i asked him , &quot; why are you helping me ? &quot;
sometimes you can create potholes with that .
the journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
thank you .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
so we arrived there with italian seeds in southern zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the  UNK  river , and we taught the local people how to grow italian tomatoes and  UNK  and ...
from 1971 to 1977 -- i look young , but i &apos;m not â€” -- i worked in zambia , kenya , ivory coast , algeria , somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with african countries .
when you see a  UNK  like this , the first thing that comes to your mind is , these are disgusting , ugly , greedy creatures that are just after your flesh , associated with politicians .
i fear that these changes will not last much beyond the u.s. troops &apos;  UNK  .
if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; no , no , cameron , i want to be a model , &quot; well then i say , &quot; be my boss . &quot;
l.a. leads the united states in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
every time i use my mobile phone ?
i wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like free the slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
before march , 2011 , i was a photographic  UNK  based in new york city .
we got dirty , and we loved it .
no one knows what the hell we do .
if we can make this material  UNK  , then probably we have a solution .
in china , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
that equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
just as i was starting to get used to my new life , i received a shocking phone call .
driving down a road in ghana with partners of free the slaves , a fellow  UNK  on a  UNK  suddenly sped up to our  UNK  and tapped on the window .
so what i want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all  UNK  like my friend  UNK   UNK  .
we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
standing in the near darkness , i remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , i could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
now , sadly , neurological disorders such as parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend  UNK   UNK  , who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time .
all of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
where am i from ? who am i ?
i &apos;ll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for .
i couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
over 85 percent of  UNK  are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
even though adjusting to life in south korea was not easy , i made a plan .
each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
UNK  , michigan . henry ford .
so we can benefit from the international community for education , english language training , job training , and more .
thank you .
i was also a very typical victim because i knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
it &apos;s my gospel , when i &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .
&quot; we have no freedom , &quot; they said .
it could take months .
other outcomes include long-term  UNK  , even after the  UNK   UNK  ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to  UNK  the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend  UNK  time with the man who beat their mother .
that &apos;s 20 central parks .
there are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
now , the last thing i wanted to do was leave new york , and my dream job , but i thought you made sacrifices for your  UNK  , so i agreed , and i quit my job , and  UNK  and i left manhattan together .
so we did aging on the samples , did a lot of loading on it , healed them with our  UNK  machine , and healed them and tested them again .
so basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit .
thank you .
so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
i lost all hope .
one was that he , too , had just graduated from an ivy league school , and that he worked at a very impressive wall street bank .
&quot; before i die , i want to live off the grid . &quot;
so then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it .
i want to introduce you to kofi .
one in three american women experiences domestic violence or  UNK  at some point in her life , and the cdc reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million .
amongst all the astonishing people i met there , i met a  UNK  of free the slaves , an ngo dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
i will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge , because unlike  UNK  surgeons , it can just be distilled right into -- right now .
here &apos;s me at a slumber party a few days before i shot french  UNK  .
those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the nairobi national park .
well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , slender figures , and  UNK  and white skin .
as you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
this person has never been born .
otherwise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
and i refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people , and i &apos;m manufacturing my own reality .
like me , they are dreaming big .
so they donated to us a piece of highway , 400 meters of the  UNK  , where we had to make a test track to test this material .
and here &apos;s me today .
some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
my dog is a black lab , and i drive a  UNK  odyssey  UNK  .
they had to get out quickly , so i started planning how to help them escape .
if there &apos;s a  UNK  to this talk , i hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
when i met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be  UNK  .
kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
it read , &quot; when you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t eaten for the past two weeks .
so  UNK  , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of new york .
i do have too many  UNK  heels which i never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that i get is the free stuff that i get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
and what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
thank you .
we have groups of volunteers supporting the enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
&quot; why didn &apos;t you tell us ? &quot; &quot; you never asked . &quot;
five years ago , i experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be alice in wonderland .
what can you do ? can you make it ?
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
aware of the devastation and the challenges , i was keen among many other women to rebuild the  UNK  civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
one of them got caught up in the water .
he told me two things .
someone had accused me of being north korean , so they tested my chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
i &apos;d have to rely on free the slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and i trusted that they would .
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
like ahmed . that &apos;s not his real name , and i cannot show you his face , but ahmed is the father of one of my students .
you should see the rubbish â€” -- you should see the rubbish that we have  UNK  on  UNK  african people .
there &apos;s a lovely story that i read in a  UNK  magazine many , many years ago .
thank you .
when one dollar &apos;s worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce .
there were no back doors .
how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
we see all the same symptoms .
and these projects came from questions i had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
i had no idea what life was going to be like as a north korean refugee , but i soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since north korean refugees are considered in china as illegal migrants .
so what you do -- you shut up .
but unfortunately i have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired nyu ph.d. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the  UNK  models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were  UNK  .
i mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
many have been  UNK  by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
and he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
we need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
we need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge , collaboration instead of competition , inclusion instead of exclusion .
according to a  UNK  verse &quot;  UNK  &quot; -- peace -- &quot; is the word of the  UNK  god ,  UNK  . &quot;
she also had  UNK  .
i wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
i &apos;ve spent most of my career working for fortune 500 companies including johnson &amp; amp ; johnson , leo  UNK  and the washington post .
i want to shine a light on slavery .
then what you do is you heat up the steel , you melt the  UNK  , and the  UNK  will flow into these  UNK  , and the stones are again fixed to the surface .
now we teach entrepreneurship to  UNK  in  UNK  , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of richard  UNK  &apos;s autobiography , and the task of the  UNK  is to  UNK  , in the first two pages of richard  UNK  &apos;s autobiography how many times richard uses the word &quot; i &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
that &apos;s a little bit scary .
i remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my yard , and i came out and they looked so ashamed .
our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and i believe it &apos;s our responsibility as  UNK  to have these interactions .
we western donor countries have given the african continent two trillion american dollars in the last 50 years .
but what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
when my hand slips , i suddenly remember a miner i had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; wow , how stupid was she , &quot; but this whole time , i &apos;ve actually been talking about you .
the internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the feminine values of compassion , mercy and inclusion .
so planning has this blind spot .
i realized that the man who i loved so much was going to kill me if i let him .
kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in africa :  UNK  wind turbines are going to be up at lake  UNK  .
in south asia , in countries like india and pakistan , four species of  UNK  are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a  UNK  drug like  UNK  .
UNK  . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
and if you don &apos;t believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
and here &apos;s where those guns come in .
and after a few months went by , i realized that he was different .
so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
funny thing is , the  UNK  are killing more people than the  UNK  .
then you can have a lot of  UNK  water in the asphalt .
almost two years have passed since the  UNK  revolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the tunisian and the egyptian revolutions .
get  UNK  with your shovel , okay ?
you have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
we are at the end of the first industrial revolution --  UNK  fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
in 2009 , i lost someone i loved very much .
so this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they  UNK  me during my own tough times .
five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and i put on my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and i married him .
now don &apos;t get me wrong .
i &apos;m not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
may we all be granted a grace of mercy .
when he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even i could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
i want to challenge that . do you know why ?
you want to read the book , read &quot; dead aid , &quot; by  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  woman economist .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
i &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
you &apos;d be surprised how kids are affected by this .
what i &apos;m talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pride and the honor in growing your own food , opening farmer &apos;s markets .
you see , i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the  UNK  thighs and the  UNK  hair and the coolest clothes , and they &apos;re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet .
but i know electric fences are already invented , but i want to make mine .
we have eight species of  UNK  that occur in kenya , of which six are highly threatened with extinction .
once a week , we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up , where people were reclaiming their photos .
but you have to fight for your  UNK  today .
i have a  UNK  in english from harvard college , an mba in marketing from  UNK  business school .
he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded .
we &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
it was more like a restaurant .
there was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the taliban , despite the risks .
i &apos;d also note that i &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
young  UNK  women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime , raising slogans of freedom , dignity , social justice .
this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and i just woke up in the morning and i found it dead , and i felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
they own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
thus we are told that &quot; my mercy  UNK  all things . &quot;
i went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to get my family out , but i didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore .
so what happens ? in 40 years &apos; time , in the year 1900 , in the united states of america , there were  UNK  car manufacturing companies --  UNK  .
i promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are  UNK  themselves .
okay , can you sell it ? can you look after the money ? &quot;
and then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition ,  UNK  tests are  UNK  .
i started studying for the university entrance exam .
on march 11 , 2011 , i watched from home , as the rest of the world did , as the tragic events unfolded in japan .
recognize the early signs of violence and  UNK  intervene ,  UNK  it , show victims a safe way out .
and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
the waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height , and traveled over two miles inland .
our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- that we first held .
samuel is 16 . he &apos;s tall . he &apos;s very handsome .
so what happened ?
so what i &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at .
i want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block .
he took everyone &apos;s i.d. cards , and he started asking them questions .
so what i did , i planted a food forest in front of my house .
we all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
i would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
with a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in syria .
but today , more than three million girls are in school in afghanistan .
but i only thought that i would be separated from my family for a short time .
at first i saw it , and i said , okay , it &apos;s a huge file . okay .
i met him at a shelter where free the slaves  UNK  victims of slavery .
because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline .
the day of the tsunami , he &apos;d actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed .
let me tell you a secret .
here &apos;s me on the soccer team and in v magazine .
i don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
our society needs national dialogue and  UNK  more than it needed the elections , which only reinforced polarization and division .
i  UNK  a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids .
all this information is stored for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your internet service provider .
to solve this problem , we thought of  UNK  materials .
so do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
please don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m normal .
let &apos;s see . yeah , it worked .
within two weeks , i had 150 people wanting to join in .
our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; ripples from the  UNK  , &quot; was a project where we italians decided to teach  UNK  people how to grow food .
it &apos;s much better than that .
the north korean authorities  UNK  some money that i sent to my family , and , as a punishment , my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; hell no , i ain &apos;t afraid they &apos;re gonna steal it .
thank you very much .
this is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
and i cannot remember the first moment i encountered autism , but i cannot recall a day without it .
a total  UNK  from a remote province of afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was  UNK  by his father .
now , we were lucky with our  UNK  .
that &apos;s all this project was about , about restoring those little bits of humanity , giving someone that connection back .
and in  UNK  , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of new york in 100 years , and the conclusion was  UNK  : the city of new york would not exist in 100 years .
at first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
it was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again .
first question to answer for us : so what ?
it &apos;s all around us . we just don &apos;t see it .
one in particular , a photo of women of all ages , from grandmother to little girl , gathered around a baby , struck a chord , because a similar photo from my family , my grandmother and mother , myself , and newborn daughter , hangs on our wall .
during taliban years , i remember there were times i would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
really scared . scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
these are the guys , they helped me  UNK  the truck .
now this is one of my plans . this is what i want to do .
ultimately , more than a million north koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
i led an initiative by the  UNK  women &apos;s platform for peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to  UNK  on political parties the  UNK  of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists , creating the  UNK  list .
so at the end , i had a settlement with them .
and he was very , very sorry .
after i paid the fine and bribe , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of  UNK  .
so over the past few years , i &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like stickers , stencils and chalk .
that means they can be  UNK  .
he was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
and now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .
but most people don &apos;t agree .
back to my question : why did i stay ?
it will look something like this .
we &apos;re pale , gray creatures .
so we started  UNK  photos .
i didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
her photos were found by her husband &apos;s colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood , and they &apos;d recognized him .
it was on a strip of land that we call a  UNK  .
in a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
then he pointed toward this barely visible  UNK  , and said , &quot; this is the path , this is the path . go . &quot;
read it from an african woman , the damage that we have done .
but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonderland .
but this time , i would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
this was one of the lowest points in my life .
i told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and i &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
but if we don &apos;t change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
and if you ever are wondering , &quot; if i have thinner thighs and  UNK  hair , will i be happier ? &quot;
now ,  UNK  did not come home one day and announce , &quot; you know , hey , all this romeo and juliet stuff has been great , but i need to move into the next phase where i isolate you and i abuse you &quot; â€” â€” &quot; so i need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot;
&quot; as i worked , i couldn &apos;t help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images .
UNK  do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
but i cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individuality and communication and love , and i realize that these are things that i wouldn &apos;t want to change with normality .
one day we wake up to the news of the  UNK  of ancient mosques and sufi  UNK  .
now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
peace . thank you .
plus you get strawberries .
and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that i &apos;ve been  UNK  out on .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
&quot; kill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but i will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot;
and we need to establish that  UNK  before we do so  UNK  .
my soul is always  UNK  by the giant live oak trees , shading lovers ,  UNK  and  UNK  for hundreds of years , and i trust a city that always makes way for music .
eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
and my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
instead , i was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man , and i was the only person on earth who could help  UNK  face his demons .
when his uncle died ,  UNK  inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
and some even said , this would be  UNK  2.0 .
the big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids  UNK  them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
the shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be  UNK  so that they can extract the gold .
death is something that we &apos;re often discouraged to talk about or even think about , but i &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
since my family couldn &apos;t understand chinese , i thought my family was going to be arrested .
back in the  UNK  , i wanted to cry , but the  UNK  next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; lisa , don &apos;t do that . just don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
this wasn &apos;t a  UNK  , per se .
now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial  UNK  that may well have a genetic component to it .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
and then somebody complained .
women won  UNK  percent of the national congress in the first elections ever in 52 years .
we can do  UNK  monitoring to get objective data .
so that evening , i just reached out on facebook and asked a few of them , and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive , i knew we had to give it a go .
thank you .
there are the new world  UNK  that are mainly found in the americas , like the  UNK  and the  UNK  , and then the old world  UNK  , where we have 16 species . from these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .
the smartest people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .
this was the very first .
and because the engineers that i &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , i want to summarize with an equation .
you know , he changed his mind when he came back , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
because  UNK  do not keep the environment clean .
and yeah , they pretty much  UNK  all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
it may even be your story .
under the taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
i even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and i &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
you can be extraordinary .
UNK  stores , fast food , vacant lots .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it &apos;s not going to help you .
potholes , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- we &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
you have to offer them  UNK  , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in droves .
as he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
and making your ideas accessible is not the same as  UNK  it down .
i was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
instead , this example slide by  UNK  brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of  UNK  are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the eiffel tower .
so now you &apos;re rebuilding christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
sometimes , i saw dead bodies floating down the river .
it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in nairobi .
with a mobile phone , you can tweet a message and start a protest in egypt .
we make skinny models  UNK  , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get criticized in the press all the time , but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography .
however , there are  UNK  million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with  UNK  weakness , tremor ,  UNK  and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
and i also ask myself , does it really work ?
don &apos;t just tell me that you study  UNK  , but tell me that you study  UNK  , which is the  UNK  structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating  UNK  .
the real way that i became a model is i won a genetic lottery , and i am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
because i &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of american  UNK  or the ceo of h &amp; amp ; m , or the next steven  UNK  .
each cubicle is dark and  UNK  , identified with a painted number on the wall , and  UNK  by plywood and a curtain .
we had an amazing local woman who guided us .
when we first arrived , i went to have a quick look .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of new york in  UNK  .
UNK  are amongst the most threatened group of birds .
then if you drive over the road , you take out the aggregates -- what we just saw here .
i was mistaken in thinking that i was unique and alone in this situation .
because in the summer of 2006 , the e.u. commission  UNK  a directive .
hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
she &apos;s not north korean . &quot;
UNK  proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
but what if patients could do this test at home ?
but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
i &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
eventually , after our long journey , my family and i were reunited in south korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
thank you .
thinking about death  UNK  your life .
for some of them , it &apos;s given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin .
so i put the specimen in , which i &apos;m now going to take out to see what happened .
on another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the american ambassador and the attack on the  UNK  .
we delight at ballet  UNK  and tap dancers you will see later on .
because you can see where i am , where i sleep at night , what i am doing .
and the first answer is , &quot; i don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
you know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger .
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new  UNK  , and i get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
and a second idea i got was to use a  UNK  .
this is south los angeles .
but i &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it &apos;s great that i got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and i &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i got my first job , or maybe i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i paid for college , which seems so important right now .
the air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
a mobile phone can change your life , and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom .
UNK  by  UNK  and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
i grew up in cambridge , and one time i went into a store and i forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
so you got this scholarship . yep .
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
what we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
he looked at me  UNK  , but luckily he believed me .
more recently , if you &apos;ve been following the kenyan press â€” â€” these are the attributes that they associated the kenyan  UNK  with . but i want to challenge that .
kenya , this world , will be much poorer without these wonderful species .
gardening is the most therapeutic and  UNK  act you can do , especially in the inner city .
now , i live in new orleans , and i am in love with new orleans .
here &apos;s me on the same day as this shoot .
so i set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
power  UNK  also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in china , just across the river from my home .
a huge famine hit north korea in the mid-1990s .
one of the smartest things  UNK  did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that i was the dominant partner in the relationship .
so together with  UNK  online and open data city , i did this .
i grew up there . i raised my sons there .
now , it was emotional and it was inspiring , and i &apos;ve always heard about thinking outside the box , but it wasn &apos;t until i had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened .
and those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that i have never said on camera , is , &quot; i am insecure . &quot;
and across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
if you ain &apos;t a  UNK  , you ain &apos;t  UNK  .
she retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
so there &apos;s two types of  UNK  in this planet .
slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
we cleaned schools . we  UNK  and  UNK  homes ready for  UNK  and rehabilitation .
which presentation have you  UNK  the most this morning ?
first , it &apos;s only like , i call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .
i had no idea i was falling into crazy love , that i was walking  UNK  into a carefully laid physical , financial and psychological trap .
but today i will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
today i use a microwave because i cannot take the big  UNK  machine here onstage .
in the himalayas , i found children carrying stone for miles down  UNK  terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
and in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often bypassed and misunderstood .
and there are only  UNK  young black and latino men in new york , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; will i get stopped ? &quot;
as soon as we moved to new england -- you know , that place where  UNK  was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns .
penn state asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
we meet at the cafe . we meet at the pub .
jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of new york around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
talk about what you heard here .
so luckily i brought an outfit change .
so me and my group , l.a. green grounds , we got together and we started planting my food forest , fruit trees , you know , the whole nine , vegetables .
UNK  way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
i was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that i was standing near the  UNK  .
he was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
to him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
it &apos;s a noisy material , and if we produce roads like in the netherlands , very close to cities , then we would like a silent road .
on top of that ,  UNK  has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
and i was scared .
&quot; you can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
they kill our livestock .
but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; thank god we &apos;re here . &quot;
so max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
settling down in south korea was a lot more challenging than i had expected .
they mix dye in these big barrels , and they  UNK  the silk into the liquid up to their  UNK  , but the dye is toxic .
we don &apos;t work from offices .
there is not a day that goes by that i don &apos;t think of these many beautiful ,  UNK  people i &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
porous asphalt , a material that we use now in most of the highways in the netherlands , it has pores and water can just rain through it , so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that &apos;s easy to drive on , so no  UNK  water anymore .
thank you .
my topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question i &apos;m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : why does she stay ?
even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
UNK  was the secret police in east germany .
recently , the new york times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 american children are sold into sex slavery every year .
we are all korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division .
if some of the women were really horrified when i came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but i &apos;ll find out later on twitter .
and i think this is why the nairobi national park lions are few .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
this is a family portrait .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from  UNK  to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
these images are not of issues . they are of people , real people , like you and me , all  UNK  of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
the question , &quot; why does she stay ? &quot;
i would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
and we could not believe , and we were telling the  UNK  , &quot; look how easy agriculture is . &quot;
i was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
instead , as einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
but don &apos;t you ever turn into a  UNK  revolutionary . &quot;
and in this picture , i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
after they finished questioning me , one official said to another , &quot; this was a false report .
as the chinese officer approached my family , i  UNK  stood up , and i told him that these are deaf and dumb people that i was  UNK  .
the first time , i was driving to find a secret beach and i got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver &apos;s side window .
and why are these  UNK  there ?
so when i was writing this talk , i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , &quot; look i &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
but i came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the  UNK  .
i didn &apos;t know what it meant , but i could see that my father was very , very happy .
a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? &quot;
i was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were  UNK  .
so i decided to start a lawsuit against them , because i wanted to have this information .
we were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
my secret was that i had this gun loaded with  UNK  bullets pointed at my head by the man who i thought was my  UNK  , many , many times .
actually , my student  UNK  , i have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
the city came down on me , and basically gave me a  UNK  saying that i had to remove my garden , which this  UNK  was turning into a warrant .
when i was little , i thought my country was the best on the planet , and i grew up singing a song called &quot; nothing to envy . &quot;
sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , i was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
it will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
the next question people always ask me is , &quot; do they  UNK  all the photos ? &quot;
why didn &apos;t i walk out ? i could have left any time .
because of this invention , i was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in kenya ,  UNK  international school , and i &apos;m really excited about this .
but one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister .
the  UNK  in this shot pretty much had to be  UNK  , or  UNK  together , picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn &apos;t damaged .
i thought my life was over , but i managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
wrong . they were all enslaved .
she had started  UNK  them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage .
not exactly .
it was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
but  UNK   UNK  said , no , we will not give you this information .
and there it was , a great revolution .
i &apos;m confident that you will see more and more north koreans succeeding all over the world , including the ted stage .
at that moment , i heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
he screamed a lot .
and we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture .
this is south central :  UNK  stores , fast food , vacant lots .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
not everybody gets to do that .
how can you do â€” ? &quot; and i said , &quot; i do something very , very , very difficult .
&quot; before i die , i want to be someone &apos;s cavalry . &quot;
i could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
government ? forget about it !
i want to change that perception . i want to change those feelings you have for these birds , because they need our sympathy . they really do .
thus we are told that &quot; my mercy takes precedence over my anger . &quot;
so i &apos;m like , &quot; cool . i can do whatever the hell i want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and i gotta maintain it . &quot;
so why did i do that ?
since now , i &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
like i said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of berlin in autumn of 1989 had a mobile phone in their pocket .
but i will do a trial .
although i often wondered about the outside world , i thought i would spend my entire life in north korea , until everything suddenly changed .
i was given a slap in the face reading a book , &quot; small is beautiful , &quot; written by  UNK  , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
soon after , an organization i volunteer with , all hands volunteers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
i can feel the brush of  UNK  bodies passing me in the darkness , but i can &apos;t see much else .
and i &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
no one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
he has the most  UNK  memory .
so , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for  UNK  in the digital age .
how can you help ? you can become active , make noise . you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures . volunteer your time to spread the word . spread the word .
we cleared tons and tons of stinking , rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant .
i &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
but lions are very clever .
and i was  UNK  .
soon after , when i was walking past a train station , i saw something terrible that i can &apos;t erase from my memory .
in west africa , there &apos;s a horrific trade of dead  UNK  to serve the  UNK  and the  UNK  market .
this is the first outfit change on the ted stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , i think .
and i got these free things because of how i look , not who i am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
do they know where we live ?
but then after a while i realized , this is my life .
this happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos .
&quot; before i die , i want to be tried for piracy . &quot;
we can also act as a bridge between the people inside north korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change north korea from inside .
and the first idea i got was to use fire , because i thought lions were scared of fire .
peter  UNK  was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what peter  UNK  says : &quot; planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy . &quot;
he has a selective one , though .
so here are some amazing goals that i think we can deal with now .
suddenly , there was no country i could proudly call my own .
and especially if you then ride with your bicycle , and pass these cars , then that &apos;s not very nice .
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no  UNK  , carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose , and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases .
it &apos;s a small fishing town in  UNK   UNK  , about 50,000 people , one of the first that was hit by the wave .
hold it up . an android , a blackberry , wow .
for peace has an alchemy , and this alchemy is about the  UNK  , the  UNK  between the feminine and  UNK  perspectives .
the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
so with gardening , i see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
it doesn &apos;t exist .
that &apos;s double the amount of people taken from africa during the entire  UNK  slave trade .
they have nothing to compare it to .
