i can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how i left north korea , but i only can say that during the ugly years of the famine i was sent to china to live with distant relatives .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
i mean , come on , why wouldn &apos;t they ?
and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
i &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
i decided when i was 27 years old to only respond to people , and i invented a system called enterprise  UNK  , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
the big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
so he jumps in and kills the animals .
kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
i was also a very typical victim because i knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
the two words come from the latin root &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
so with help from old and new friends , i turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and  UNK  it with a  UNK  sentence : &quot; before i die , i want to ... &quot; so anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
this guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign  UNK  .
we can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make  UNK  screening feasible for the first time .
how does light look in slow motion ?
but , coca-cola did not sponsor this research .
the next question people always ask me is , &quot; can i be a model when i grow up ? &quot;
UNK  , i treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . &quot; i love you so much . &quot;
i find that americans see the fragility in changes .
something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
and i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some  UNK  who are , like , &quot; wait . naomi .  UNK  . joan  UNK  . liu wen . &quot;
instead , i stand here a proud graduate of  UNK  college .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of new york in  UNK  .
the internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
am i south korean or north korean ?
today i am 22 .
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
the day of the tsunami , he &apos;d actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed .
we &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
i am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind turbines do this to birds . they slice them in half .
but they can damage your windshield , so you &apos;re not happy with that .
it wasn &apos;t until , for example ,  UNK  that the british parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber .
i was able to leave , because of one final , sadistic beating that broke through my denial .
it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in nairobi .
they &apos;re  UNK  cost , and we all know what happens .
but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; thank god we &apos;re here . &quot;
afghanistan looks so different from here in america .
&quot; we hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our  UNK  . &quot;
she retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold ,  UNK  in water poisoned by mercury .
i was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
so i put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
as they had run from the wave , and for their lives , absolutely everything they had , everything had to be left behind .
photography has been my passion ever since i was old enough to pick up a camera , but today i want to share with you the 15 most  UNK  photos of mine , and i didn &apos;t take any of them .
government ? forget about it !
i , along with hundreds of other volunteers , knew we couldn &apos;t just sit at home , so i decided to join them for three weeks .
so what i did , i planted a food forest in front of my house .
we gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
the smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
i feel like every time someone  UNK  , new orleans has a parade .
induction can heat , especially steel ; it &apos;s very good at that .
however , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
no expensive staff time required .
what can you do ? can you make it ?
we say , &quot; it &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . &quot;
because there are no  UNK  , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of  UNK  dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have  UNK  dogs , you have a huge time bomb of  UNK  . the number of cases of  UNK  has increased tremendously in india .
he doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : he has never told a lie .
now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build  UNK  that can see deep inside the body around  UNK  , and also for  UNK  .
i could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
i &apos;m confident that you will see more and more north koreans succeeding all over the world , including the ted stage .
and what about some still-life photography ?
if kids grow  UNK  , kids eat  UNK  .
thing is , it &apos;s owned by the city .
the war and the  UNK  life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where i take local afghan fox fur and add it to a  UNK  jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable  UNK   UNK  .
what &apos;s going on here ?
it &apos;ll be a very boring movie — — of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
that &apos;s double the amount of people taken from africa during the entire  UNK  slave trade .
why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
please don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m normal .
now , the whole event
and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
peter  UNK  was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what peter  UNK  says : &quot; planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy . &quot;
we see vocal tremor , weakness and  UNK  .
UNK   UNK  . it means in my language , thank you very much .
not everybody gets to do that .
so i was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and i would be  UNK  to a horrible fate back in north korea .
we &apos;re pale , gray creatures .
abuse thrives only in silence .
it was on a strip of land that we call a  UNK  .
so  UNK  , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of new york .
today i use a microwave because i cannot take the big induction machine here onstage .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
at the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
i &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in ghana .
because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
i got to climb out of that hole , and i got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
one time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a chinese police officer .
here &apos;s me on the soccer team and in v magazine .
we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
so — — so the government says , &quot; do it again . &quot;
and yeah , they pretty much  UNK  all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
so this is our reconstruction .
so i &apos;m like , &quot; cool . i can do whatever the hell i want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and i gotta maintain it . &quot;
now , sadly , neurological disorders such as parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend jan  UNK  , who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time .
we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the packet of the photons , they will scatter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden  UNK  , which in turn will again scatter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot .
amongst all the astonishing people i met there , i met a supporter of free the slaves , an ngo dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
we activate communities .
when you walk out of this room , you will be informed about  UNK  , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighbors about  UNK  .
it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
when i met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
and i believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
it may even be your story .
ha . he &apos;s ready .
then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
and i discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
UNK  way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
so for the next five years , i dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , misinterpreted .
and i &apos;m insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day .
that &apos;s all this project was about , about restoring those little bits of humanity , giving someone that connection back .
i met  UNK  on a cold , rainy january night .
but lions are very clever .
now , all these photos had been damaged by water , submerged in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so  UNK  them was a huge part of the project .
each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
in a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
no one knows what the hell we do .
a morning that i will never forget .
we need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
because it turns out that i &apos;m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
as for me , i &apos;d have to wait until i got home to really feel my heartbreak .
the textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
i live in south central .
now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
one of my favorite words in the whole of the oxford english dictionary is &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
so now you &apos;re rebuilding christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
not that catchy .
all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
thank you .
so i am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what i do .
so we still have the specimen here . it &apos;s quite warm .
we are all korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division .
if you ain &apos;t a gardener , you ain &apos;t gangsta .
we are the soil .
you could not get a worse insult , and that from charles darwin .
we &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- carnegie ,  UNK  , edison , ford , all the new companies , google , yahoo .
this strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient egypt or dante &apos;s inferno .
so i &apos;m like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and i told them , you know , you don &apos;t have to do this like this .
this is south los angeles .
what we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
porous asphalt , a material that we use now in most of the highways in the netherlands , it has pores and water can just rain through it , so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that &apos;s easy to drive on , so no splash water anymore .
can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
i present you a new type of photography ,  UNK  , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
but nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visualizations , since our invention , we have  UNK  all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the diy , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop  UNK  about the  UNK  in cameras — — and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
and those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that i have never said on camera , is , &quot; i am insecure . &quot;
thank you .
absolutely .
when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red , overnight , some 200  UNK  came out from the river and they ate everything .
but one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister .
the  UNK  are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
you &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
but this is the geography of self .
i &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
i want to challenge that . do you know why ?
there she is .
this young child is eight years old .
i truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
i will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge , because unlike  UNK  surgeons , it can just be distilled right into -- right now .
we had these magnificent tomatoes . in italy , a tomato would grow to this size . in zambia , to this size .
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no  UNK  , carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose , and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases .
and i thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time i &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
we hide in dark , windowless rooms , and generally avoid sunlight .
now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
i mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center  UNK  for them to  UNK  , and  UNK  on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same  UNK  work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
they were already drowning in manure .
i use the garden , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my  UNK  for that cloth .
he told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
everything i do , and everything i do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in africa .
our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; ripples from the  UNK  , &quot; was a project where we italians decided to teach  UNK  people how to grow food .
we happened to be back in new york exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
but they mean two different things .
over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back , fully restored and  UNK  .
this was one of the lowest points in my life .
it happened twice more on the  UNK  .
they kill our livestock .
so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
it &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
but as these conversations unfolded , i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
so i set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , i was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
i feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day , and forget what really matters to you .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
so what is the problem with  UNK  ?
i was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that i was standing near the  UNK  .
so how did my team at mit create this camera ?
i promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are  UNK  themselves .
take your science , subtract your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
so green grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
when these villagers claimed their freedom , the  UNK  burned down all of their houses .
i &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
no one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
can we see it in full 3d ?
we can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data .
we &apos;re working with local communities .
in my broken english , and with a dictionary , i explained the situation , and without  UNK  , the man went to the atm and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other north koreans to get out of jail .
so they wanted to give him the  UNK  ,  UNK  , most pathetic title that they could think of .
so i had an idea .
UNK  , michigan . henry ford .
actually , it still has to cool down first before i can show you that the healing works .
it &apos;s my gospel , when i &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .
there were no windows large enough to climb through .
it was 7 a.m. i still had on my nightgown .
this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
so this is the specimen coming out now .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red  UNK  of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light .
so one year ago , i was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and i used to see planes flying over , and i told myself that one day , i &apos;ll be there inside .
before march , 2011 , i was a photographic  UNK  based in new york city .
well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , slender figures , and  UNK  and white skin .
recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with full futures .
back in the  UNK  , i wanted to cry , but the  UNK  next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; lisa , don &apos;t do that . just don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
so pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
after six months in japan , 1,100 volunteers had passed through all hands , hundreds of whom had helped us  UNK  over  UNK  photographs , the large majority
so i arrived by truck with about 50 rebels to the battle for  UNK  as a 19-year-old vegetarian surfer from  UNK  , florida .
thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
and i hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
and so i stand here today , afghan by blood ,  UNK  by the grace of god , an atheist and a radically  UNK  artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in afghanistan for the last nine years .
despite what had happened , i was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because i loved him , and he loved me so much .
i &apos;d have to rely on free the slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and i trusted that they would .
UNK  knows what love is .
growing your own food is like printing your own money .
they &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
within japan , by july , we &apos;d  UNK  out to the neighboring town of  UNK  , further north to a town called  UNK  .
these heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing i wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
the next question people always ask me is , &quot; do they  UNK  all the photos ? &quot;
first , you have to offer them  UNK  .
and that &apos;s why the senate objected to it .
by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
the  UNK  in this shot pretty much had to be  UNK  , or  UNK  together , picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn &apos;t damaged .
i was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were  UNK  .
we tend to stereotype victims as  UNK  headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods .
it &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on lake volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
so the city planners , they get together and they figure they &apos;re going to change the name south central to make it represent something else , so they change it to south los angeles , like this is going to fix what &apos;s really going wrong in the city .
you already tried it once , right , and you -- i tried it before , but i stopped because it gave me a shock .
it &apos;s a porous asphalt , like i said , so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones .
the solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt .
enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were  UNK  in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the  UNK   UNK  to trucks hundreds of yards away .
this wasn &apos;t a  UNK  , per se .
he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded .
so here are some amazing goals that i think we can deal with now .
what i &apos;m talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pride and the honor in growing your own food , opening farmer &apos;s markets .
i &apos;m here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer .
as he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
and what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
in india and nepal , i was introduced to the brick  UNK  .
and he was thrown into the tower of london and imprisoned , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough to take them on , and in the end he had such popular support in london that he won .
it &apos;s tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
what we do , we work one-on-one , and to work one-on-one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; hey , why don &apos;t you take  UNK  back to new york and make it a father-daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;
yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never-ending hyperactivity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
he didn &apos;t want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me whatsoever .
many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
so l.a. times got  UNK  of it . steve lopez did a story on it and talked to the  UNK  , and one of the green grounds members , they put up a petition on  UNK  , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .
you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
they ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
but &quot; how many times will i get stopped ? when will i get stopped ? &quot;
so i said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .
but what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
the answer is easy .
but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light washes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
and when we do this , who knows ?
thank you very much .
from 1971 to 1977 -- i look young , but i &apos;m not — -- i worked in zambia , kenya , ivory coast , algeria , somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with african countries .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
from time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because taliban were suspicious .
kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in africa :  UNK  wind turbines are going to be up at lake turkana .
more recently , if you &apos;ve been following the kenyan press — — these are the attributes that they associated the kenyan mps with . but i want to challenge that .
this one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and i found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand .
the time it took , however , to get it back is a completely different story , and it depended obviously on the damage involved .
now , i live in new orleans , and i am in love with new orleans .
and now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .
and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our  UNK  , it has some unique abilities .
i mean , some people wanted him to be called chief  UNK  washington , and other people , his  UNK  george washington , and other people , protector of the liberties of the people of the united states of america washington .
but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about  UNK  as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
so why did i do that ?
these images are not of issues . they are of people , real people , like you and me , all  UNK  of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
ninety-nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
to me , afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of  UNK  remind me of that .
peter  UNK  , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
i &apos;ve spent most of my career working for fortune 500 companies including johnson &amp; amp ; johnson , leo  UNK  and the washington post .
funny thing is , the  UNK  are killing more people than the  UNK  .
and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
and i am on this stage because i am a model .
but when i am back in afghanistan , when i see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , i see a promising future and lasting change .
some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ripples of waves .
within two weeks , i had 150 people wanting to join in .
just as i was starting to get used to my new life , i received a shocking phone call .
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
there were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government , but it was really a nothing title .
and this was debated in congress for ages and ages .
there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
my interpreter told me their stories .
and i &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
UNK  believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
you don &apos;t get a chance to mess it up .
so actually , i was in very good company .
english was so important in south korea , so i had to start learning my third language .
i was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine .
now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
guess what ?
it also has disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that  UNK  can occur .
i want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in afghanistan has become conflict  UNK  .
i shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
the house of representatives didn &apos;t want washington to get drunk on power .
that &apos;s the whole idea .
every year , countless north koreans are caught in china and  UNK  to north korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
i met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
we &apos;re trying to determine their basic ecology , and see where they go .
the smartest people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .
so this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they  UNK  me during my own tough times .
even though i was really fortunate to get out , many other north koreans have not been so lucky .
not terribly damaged , but where the water had caused that  UNK  on the girl &apos;s face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy .
some north koreans in china seek asylum in foreign  UNK  , but many can be caught by the chinese police and  UNK  .
i even went through an identity crisis .
my  UNK  even called in and said how they endorse and love what we &apos;re doing .
you want to read the book , read &quot; dead aid , &quot; by  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  woman economist .
well you can see where this is going .
there &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : none were started by one person .
he &apos;s not greedy . he doesn &apos;t see skin color .
he did this especially at the beginning by  UNK  me .
so me and my group , l.a. green grounds , we got together and we started planting my food forest , fruit trees , you know , the whole nine , vegetables .
he kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
he has the most  UNK  memory .
so planning has this blind spot .
we pulled debris from canals and  UNK  .
it was more like a restaurant .
but even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
and we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture .
we couldn &apos;t  UNK  the photo unless it was cleaned , dry and reclaimed .
thank you very much .
this is south central : liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
and this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of brass  UNK  , who took on parliament .
president . they didn &apos;t invent the title . i mean , it existed before , but it just meant somebody who  UNK  over a meeting .
i know we &apos;re getting personal , but i was a young girl .
so what i want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all  UNK  like my friend jan  UNK  .
a total maverick from a remote province of afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was  UNK  by his father .
so after our paper was published in nature communications , it was highlighted by  UNK  , and they created this animation .
it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
in hindu mythology ,  UNK  was the  UNK  god , and he risked his life in order to save the goddess  UNK  from the  UNK  demon  UNK  .
my secret was that i had this gun loaded with  UNK  bullets pointed at my head by the man who i thought was my  UNK  , many , many times .
the north korean authorities  UNK  some money that i sent to my family , and , as a punishment , my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside .
so then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it .
now , if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons shatter into this bottle ?
so they donated to us a piece of highway , 400 meters of the  UNK  , where we had to make a test track to test this material .
and i was distraught .
i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
you know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger .
i always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
so over the past few years , i &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like stickers , stencils and chalk .
and i &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
that &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , i decided to risk going to south korea , and i started a new life yet again .
you know ? you can be anything .
also the noise will disappear in these pores .
and i &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple kabul  UNK  and putting it on the wall amidst kipling &apos;s call of  UNK  to generate dialogue about how i see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colonial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even  UNK  him a bit .
but i do them because i have to , because the geography of self mandates it .
it &apos;s about time . thank you .
&quot; before i die , i want to hold her one more time . &quot;
and in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often bypassed and misunderstood .
for the last 28 years , i &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 i had the great honor of being the sole  UNK  at the vancouver peace summit .
the workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
never the word &quot; i , &quot; and the word &quot; we &quot; 32 times .
to me , this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : it &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an  UNK  .
so actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .
but this time , i would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
otherwise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
when i was little , i thought my country was the best on the planet , and i grew up singing a song called &quot; nothing to envy . &quot;
we had an amazing local woman who guided us .
barack obama , president obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the senate to spring into action .
there is a problem with community meetings .
i would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
that means they can be  UNK  .
i wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
i mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
it manifests in each individual differently , hence why  UNK  is so different from sam .
several times we can repeat that .
it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and einstein would have loved to see this picture .
i didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
the school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
you should see the rubbish — -- you should see the rubbish that we have  UNK  on unsuspecting african people .
in west africa , there &apos;s a horrific trade of dead  UNK  to serve the  UNK  and the  UNK  market .
this is where i live . i live in kenya , at the south parts of the nairobi national park .
it was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again .
&quot; oh , no , i cannot do this . &quot; &quot; would you like me to find you somebody ? &quot;
it &apos;s a small fishing town in  UNK   UNK  , about 50,000 people , one of the first that was hit by the wave .
i &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
if we can make this material  UNK  , then probably we have a solution .
first you get one stone , then several more , and more and more and more and more , and then they -- well , i will not do that .
slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
and of course , barring surgery , or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and  UNK  , has a huge impact on our lives .
in south asia , in countries like india and pakistan , four species of  UNK  are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a  UNK  drug like  UNK  .
first of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
and the indicator box makes the lights flash .
now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
i was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and i got frustrated , and  UNK  used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that i could not breathe or scream , and he used the  UNK  to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
so i set up everything .
we &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
i would like to conclude by reading an email i got from one of them , cindy , the day i finally got back from japan after six months .
wrong . they were all enslaved .
a lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an  UNK  child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother &apos;s face .
so what &apos;s being done ? well , we &apos;re conducting research on these birds . we &apos;re putting transmitters on them .
it &apos;s a noisy material , and if we produce roads like in the netherlands , very close to cities , then we would like a silent road .
and when you &apos;re describing your science , beware of jargon .
i grew up there . i raised my sons there .
not exactly .
so years and years ago , i had this idea : why don &apos;t we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why don &apos;t , for once , listen to them ? but not in community meetings .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
thank you .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
i hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and i hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of  UNK  can continue to live in the shadows .
one in particular , a photo of women of all ages , from grandmother to little girl , gathered around a baby , struck a chord , because a similar photo from my family , my grandmother and mother , myself , and newborn daughter , hangs on our wall .
there &apos;s another time when i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown los angeles .
he kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
and i helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in  UNK  for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; hey , you helped them . can you help us ? &quot;
i was mistaken in thinking that i was unique and alone in this situation .
and that &apos;s the important lesson i think you can take away , and the one i want to leave you with .
your money can be stolen . you can be forced to leave your home during a war .
and a second idea i got was to use a  UNK  .
now this is one of my plans . this is what i want to do .
we victims need everyone .
first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as i &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the senate has never formally  UNK  the title of president .
so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice  UNK  , and the client says , &quot; cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
what i &apos;ve come to realize about afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the west , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
we need to work with governments in regional levels .
UNK  by  UNK  and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
he sat next to me on the new york city subway , and he started chatting me up .
we are at the end of the first industrial revolution --  UNK  fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
this morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; can we -- can you imagine a city that is not  UNK  ? &quot;
this is what i looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier .
thanks so much . max little , everybody .
and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that i &apos;ve been  UNK  out on .
sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
her name was joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
since i was a small boy , i used to work in my room for the whole day , and i even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but i learned a lot about electronics .
mps do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
i was 22 , and in the united states , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the united states .
there are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
but what if patients could do this test at home ?
you could be the president of the united states , or the inventor of the next internet , or a ninja  UNK  surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
we are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot;
and so the senate won in the end .
but if we don &apos;t change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
over time , more photos came in , thankfully , and more  UNK  were needed , and so i reached out again on facebook and linkedin , and within five days , 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
but  UNK  , with parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biomarkers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test .
talk about what you heard here .
she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if i could put the lights for her .
there are the new world  UNK  that are mainly found in the americas , like the  UNK  and the  UNK  , and then the old world  UNK  , where we have 16 species . from these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .
UNK  first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
i told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and i &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
l.a. leads the united states in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
when i was 11 , i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
recognize the early signs of violence and  UNK  intervene ,  UNK  it , show victims a safe way out .
now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . foxp2 , for example .
but to really show you how words and politics interact , i want to take you back to the united states of america , just after they &apos;d achieved independence .
but those guns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
they had to get out quickly , so i started planning how to help them escape .
i was just three years old when my brother came along , and i was so excited that i had a new being in my life .
and in  UNK  , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of new york in 100 years , and the conclusion was  UNK  : the city of new york would not exist in 100 years .
and making your ideas accessible is not the same as  UNK  it down .
when charles darwin went across the atlantic in  UNK  on the  UNK  , he saw the turkey  UNK  , and he said , &quot; these are disgusting birds with bald  UNK  heads that are formed to  UNK  in  UNK  . &quot;
so i want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
and everyone was doing the same .
i didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
we cleared tons and tons of stinking , rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant .
i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
thank you so much . thank you .
to solve this problem , we thought of  UNK  materials .
for as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
and the  UNK  said , &quot; yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot;
reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur .
they are very graceful . charles darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies .
right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; wow , how stupid was she , &quot; but this whole time , i &apos;ve actually been talking about you .
north koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
i thought it was only us italians  UNK  around africa , but then i saw what the americans were doing , what the english were doing , what the french were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , i became quite proud of our project in zambia .
she also had  UNK  .
so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
long before that i had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend  UNK  and saturday soccer games and  UNK  with racist children of the  UNK  and  UNK  demonstrations chanting , &quot; down with communism and long live afghanistan , &quot; and burning  UNK  of  UNK  before i even knew what it meant .
you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
he screamed a lot .
i started studying for the university entrance exam .
it &apos;s really become sacred to us .
i saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
they own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
we western donor countries have given the african continent two trillion american dollars in the last 50 years .
and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
at that moment , i heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
and the first idea i got was to use fire , because i thought lions were scared of fire .
i &apos;m not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
so what that means is that people will be able to — people will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
and here &apos;s me today .
i have a  UNK  in english from harvard college , an mba in marketing from  UNK  business school .
the older ladies sometimes hadn &apos;t seen a scanner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scanned , uploaded to a cloud server , it would be downloaded by a  UNK  , a stranger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it &apos;d start being fixed .
now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in afghanistan , but personally i don &apos;t want to paint rainbows ; i want to make art that  UNK  identity and challenges authority and exposes hypocrisy and  UNK  reality and even uses kind of an imaginative  UNK  to try and understand the world that we live in .
so we started  UNK  photos .
we western people are  UNK  ,  UNK  missionaries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : we either  UNK  them , or we are  UNK  .
that equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
some i even considered like my second home .
because , you see , at least we fed the  UNK  .
let &apos;s see . yeah , it worked .
that &apos;s why the white people in africa are called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; boss .
we have groups of volunteers supporting the enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
even though adjusting to life in south korea was not easy , i made a plan .
and i got a switch where i can switch on the lights , on and off .
how can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
so max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
as my team leader  UNK  once said , it &apos;s like doing a tattoo on someone .
all of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
a real school .
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
i thanked him with all my heart , and i asked him , &quot; why are you helping me ? &quot;
and this is how i decided to maintain it .
so , superman can fly .
so what i &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at .
when i was working in the field , i brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , i imparted to the people i was photographing that i wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , i made these images .
each cubicle is dark and  UNK  , identified with a painted number on the wall , and  UNK  by plywood and a curtain .
when he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even i could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
we delight at ballet  UNK  and tap dancers you will see later on .
i had moved to new york city for my first job as a writer and editor at  UNK  magazine .
people are dying from curable diseases in south central los angeles .
he has a selective one , though .
&quot; before i die , i want to be tried for piracy . &quot;
meanwhile , the ripples are traveling on the table , and because of the reflections at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the reflections are focused .
and first , i  UNK  you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
it was very time-consuming .
these people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
and we said to the  UNK  , &quot; my god , the  UNK  ! &quot;
and we could not believe , and we were telling the  UNK  , &quot; look how easy agriculture is . &quot;
you have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
they help to kill all the bacteria . they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals .
and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
it started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , i flew down to los angeles to meet with the director of free the slaves and offer them my help .
the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
back to my question : why did i stay ?
and i see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the parkinson &apos;s voice initiative .
astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
i remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my yard , and i came out and they looked so ashamed .
so i put the specimen in , which i &apos;m now going to take out to see what happened .
since my family couldn &apos;t speak chinese , i had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in china and then into southeast asia .
the funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
i used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
so , in the future , when this  UNK  is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it .
&quot; i &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time warp , we can correct for this distortion .
there were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe  UNK  made  UNK  pretty much inconsequential .
so i broke the silence .
and i refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people , and i &apos;m manufacturing my own reality .
it &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
we got dirty , and we loved it .
on may the 13th , i made my way to the town of  UNK  .
after we finished talking , i felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and i thought , if i don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
but when none of this is presented to them , if they &apos;re not shown how food affects the mind and the body , they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
thank you .
in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
and i &apos;ll tell you why .
what we do , we &apos;re a  UNK  kind of group , where it &apos;s composed of gardeners from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it &apos;s completely volunteer , and everything we do is free .
jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
because mps do not keep the environment clean .
a hundred and forty-seven .
the man who i loved more than anybody on earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than i can even remember .
many of them drown .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist &apos;s clinic to do it .
one of them was this grandmother .
what do you call the leader of a republican country ?
liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
that was , i don &apos;t know what happened there .
and i think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; if you are a little bit  UNK  and you have  UNK  hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot;
less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from  UNK  to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
plus i got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn &apos;t impregnated with pesticides .
you probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road .
mercury is used in the extraction process .
why is that ? because the tomato is actually ripe , and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several  UNK  of a second .
most people think that &apos;s down to the metal .
standing in the near darkness , i remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , i could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it &apos;s not going to help you .
and of course , everything in africa grew beautifully .
&quot; before i die , i want to be completely myself . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to call him king in case that gave him ideas , or his successor ideas .
i could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
nairobi national park is not  UNK  in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
also , asphalt can create a lot of noise .
and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
i wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
the book was published in 2009 .
so we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab .
the air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
but i came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the  UNK  .
the person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
so that evening , i just reached out on facebook and asked a few of them , and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive , i knew we had to give it a go .
i &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so i want to help give aspiring north koreans a chance to prosper with international support .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
when his uncle died ,  UNK  inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
&quot; you can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
something to do with words , i assume .
it made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why i do this , and people asked me , &quot; fin , aren &apos;t you afraid people are going to steal your food ? &quot;
and they had to face the question of what to call george washington , their leader .
UNK  are amongst the most threatened group of birds .
and then somebody complained .
so luckily i brought an outfit change .
the question , &quot; why does she stay ? &quot;
at the end of my first week there , i found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town .
cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
you can give somebody an idea .
it &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you .
is code for some people for , &quot; it &apos;s her fault for staying , &quot; as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us .
i was 22 . i had just graduated from harvard college .
we cleaned schools . we  UNK  and  UNK  homes ready for  UNK  and rehabilitation .
and i was scared .
well , to conclude , i can say that we made a material using steel fibers , the addition of steel fibers , using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks .
you &apos;d be surprised how kids are affected by this .
the reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting poisoned is because there &apos;s  UNK  conflicts . the  UNK  communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the  UNK  are falling victim to this .
and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
i was so scared , i thought my heart was going to explode .
there were no back doors .
and i was like , &quot; cool . bring it . &quot;
and i was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
and how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant  UNK  , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son &apos;s 14th birthday .
now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial  UNK  that may well have a genetic component to it .
in the cold , windy night .
i want to introduce you to kofi .
those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the nairobi national park .
they have nothing to compare it to .
you can watch the ripples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
although there was a 19th-century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said , &quot; a  UNK  is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party , platform or principle , and who , when he wins , gets there by the sheer force of monumental  UNK   UNK  . &quot;
second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting  UNK  years later .
kenya , this world , will be much poorer without these wonderful species .
we can also act as a bridge between the people inside north korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change north korea from inside .
thanks .
there were no art directors , no  UNK  , no chance for  UNK  , not even any regard for lighting .
thank you .
i don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , i &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
now i have no idea what &quot;  UNK  &quot; is .
but i know electric fences are already invented , but i want to make mine .
if there &apos;s a  UNK  to this talk , i hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
with  UNK  and  UNK  , we &apos;re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
let me tell you a secret .
we started talking about slavery , and really , i started learning about slavery , for i had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
just like a graffiti artist , where they  UNK  walls , me , i beautiful lawns ,  UNK  .
in china , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
and i think this is why the nairobi national park lions are few .
the project &apos;s also made a big difference in the lives of the  UNK  .
all right .
one of the smartest things  UNK  did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that i was the dominant partner in the relationship .
now don &apos;t get me wrong .
thank you .
i want to spend a day in the life of a  UNK   UNK  who wears his jihad against the communists like  UNK  bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich .
it &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between north korea and south korea , so , ironically , i took a flight back to china and i headed toward the north korean border .
actually , for 10 years .
you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the  UNK  thighs and the  UNK  hair and the coolest clothes , and they &apos;re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet .
so these photos are far more than  UNK  for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
instead ,  UNK  came home one friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me , because i had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on wall street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in new england where he could start his life over with me by his side .
even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car  UNK  as i drove down the highway , poured coffee  UNK  on my head as i dressed for a job interview , i never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
these are the guys , they helped me  UNK  the truck .
so we arrived there with italian seeds in southern zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the  UNK  river , and we taught the local people how to grow italian tomatoes and  UNK  and ...
i thought , age 21 , that we italians were good people and we were doing good work in africa .
and the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the house of representatives were against the senate .
i didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
it was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
this should be the first principle of aid .
just because it sounds so good .
and i got these free things because of how i look , not who i am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; come on , really ?
the first time , i was driving to find a secret beach and i got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver &apos;s side window .
but most people don &apos;t agree .
who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
my soul is always  UNK  by the giant live oak trees , shading lovers ,  UNK  and  UNK  for hundreds of years , and i trust a city that always makes way for music .
here &apos;s me on the same day as this shoot .
it &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
there &apos;s a  UNK  hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
so a microwave is a similar system .
that &apos;s just how i felt as i had those conversations with the students . i was amazed at the ideas that they had , and i wanted others to experience this wonderland as well .
i have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
they were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for  UNK  .
i didn &apos;t know what it meant , but i could see that my father was very , very happy .
over 85 percent of  UNK  are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
why in the hell would they not okay this ?
it will look something like this .
the most important thing is passion .
once a week , we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up , where people were reclaiming their photos .
it will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
i &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
we had a victory on our hands .
we see all the same symptoms .
thanks , tom .
and my idea is also being used now all over kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
i &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
to him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
he was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
this happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos .
instead , everything we touched we killed .
because i &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of american  UNK  or the ceo of h &amp; amp ; m , or the next steven  UNK  .
instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; president &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations , whether under republican or  UNK  forms of government , whose custom it is to  UNK  , through the office of the chief  UNK  , titles of respectability -- not bloody president -- and that in the intercourse with foreign nations , the majesty of the people of the united states may not be  UNK  by an appearance of singularity , i.e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weirdos .
this is on the street for a reason .
for weeks , all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things .
i also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
but now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , i would be one of them .
UNK  is 22 , tall and very handsome .
and it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase &quot; as bold as brass . &quot;
and so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
my story begins when i was in new york city for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we &apos;re on the corner of  UNK  and 5th .
he looked at me  UNK  , but luckily he believed me .
that &apos;s why i am a global ambassador for  UNK  , a global campaign to educate women .
in the himalayas , i found children carrying stone for miles down  UNK  terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
she had started  UNK  them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage .
because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- we &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like free the slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
we make skinny models  UNK  , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get criticized in the press all the time , but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography .
we tested a lot of specimens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s very interesting . we have to try that . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .
a conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
and if you ever are wondering , &quot; if i have thinner thighs and  UNK  hair , will i be happier ? &quot;
and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
&quot; the taliban are gone ! &quot; my father shouted .
it &apos;s much better than that .
this was the very first .
today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
you just couldn &apos;t imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
someone had accused me of being north korean , so they tested my chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
i met him at a shelter where free the slaves  UNK  victims of slavery .
they mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their  UNK  , but the dye is toxic .
i went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to get my family out , but i didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore .
just go and read her book .
now ,  UNK  did not come home one day and announce , &quot; you know , hey , all this romeo and juliet stuff has been great , but i need to move into the next phase where i isolate you and i abuse you &quot; — — &quot; so i need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot;
and then a few days later , driving home from our  UNK  , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold big mac in my face .
so one night , i was walking around the  UNK  with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
you have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
when you see a  UNK  like this , the first thing that comes to your mind is , these are disgusting , ugly , greedy creatures that are just after your flesh , associated with politicians .
so they kill the lions .
what is  UNK  ? you see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off .
thank you .
as you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing north koreans to secretly cross .
and i feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because i should not have worn this dress .
a hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an american worker .
it read , &quot; when you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t eaten for the past two weeks .
this person has never been born .
so there &apos;s two types of  UNK  in this planet .
i traded my converse black  UNK  for a pair of brown leather sandals and launched a rocket towards government tanks that i couldn &apos;t even see .
as soon as we moved to new england -- you know , that place where connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns .
now , we were lucky with our  UNK  .
but since publishing &quot; crazy love , &quot; i have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an  UNK  life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives -- joyous , happy lives -- as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
and across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
so i didn &apos;t give up . i continued .
and they weren &apos;t even being  UNK  there , they had the idea that you could be elected king for a fixed term .
read it from an african woman , the damage that we have done .
politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
the real way that i became a model is i won a genetic lottery , and i am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new milestones , and i get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
if they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
so i grew up hating lions so much .
they &apos;re our  UNK  and our histories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you &apos;d go back to look for .
my community , the maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
and in this picture , i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
we meet at the cafe . we meet at the pub .
it was like the foreman of the jury .
but i cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individuality and communication and love , and i realize that these are things that i wouldn &apos;t want to change with normality .
so we did aging on the samples , did a lot of loading on it , healed them with our induction machine , and healed them and tested them again .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
i was so shocked .
and it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
how can you help ? you can become active , make noise . you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures . volunteer your time to spread the word . spread the word .
i had only one way out : the stairs from where i &apos;d come in .
a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
this picture is the very first picture that i ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that i had worn a  UNK  , and i didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in america .
actually , my student  UNK  , i have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
and there are only  UNK  young black and latino men in new york , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; will i get stopped ? &quot;
&quot; as i worked , i couldn &apos;t help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images .
and so , in the end , the senate won and the house of representatives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the president of the united states of america .
they didn &apos;t know .
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in  UNK  .
the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
i started this as a  UNK  in  UNK  , in western australia .
we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; hell no , i ain &apos;t afraid they &apos;re gonna steal it .
they clean up carcasses right to the bone .
i want to change that perception . i want to change those feelings you have for these birds , because they need our sympathy . they really do .
so what happened ?
he not only  UNK  about my college degree , but also that i was the first woman , and that i am the first woman to drive him through the streets of kabul .
i couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
there &apos;s a lovely story that i read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when i grow up .
but i only thought that i would be separated from my family for a short time .
the exciting thing is that i see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
in 2009 , i lost someone i loved very much .
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
sometimes , i saw dead bodies floating down the river .
at first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
we always wondered what they knew about us .
my next invention is , i want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
penn state asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
i fear that these changes will not last much beyond the u.s. troops &apos;  UNK  .
i visited villages in india where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
and these projects came from questions i had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
so i had to find a way of solving this problem .
so i want us all to become  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  , gangsta gardeners .
thank you .
he had these big cheeks , these big apple cheeks and this  UNK  hair , and he seemed so sweet .
anyone healthy or with parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and i &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
on march 11 , 2011 , i watched from home , as the rest of the world did , as the tragic events unfolded in japan .
i had my first apartment , my first little green american express card , and i had a very big secret .
but it &apos;s very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
i don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
this is where people were handing them in , and i was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start  UNK  them .
that &apos;s 20 central parks .
as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s bouncing around inside .
our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and i believe it &apos;s our responsibility as  UNK  to have these interactions .
so , well , i do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
when one dollar &apos;s worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce .
entrepreneurs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identified .
i made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and i made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including kazakhstan , south africa , australia , argentina and beyond .
together we can make our beds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful  UNK  they should be .
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india , and they have taken a stand .
they &apos;re high-speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
suddenly , there was no country i could proudly call my own .
he &apos;s  UNK  , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best  UNK  cannot .
thank you .
the profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
during this time , we hadn &apos;t really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was printer inks .
where am i from ? who am i ?
every 20 minutes , i &apos;d have to run back to our  UNK  to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as i sat there , i thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
it &apos;s all around us . we just don &apos;t see it .
you have to offer them  UNK  , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in droves .
this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering .
ultimately , more than a million north koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the  UNK  has nothing left to lose .
what &apos;s the next one on your list ?
in school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of kim  UNK  , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that america , south korea , japan are the enemies .
then he pointed toward this barely visible  UNK  , and said , &quot; this is the path , this is the path . go . &quot;
now i &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .
today i have just one request .
he wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
they are constructions , and they are constructions by a group of professionals , by  UNK  and makeup artists and photographers and  UNK  and all of their assistants and  UNK  and  UNK  , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
&quot; kill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but i will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot;
as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . i call it a transformer .
a photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
potholes , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; do you get free stuff ? &quot;
so i want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hesitate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; will you take our picture ? &quot;
it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
i have that black lab , and i have that  UNK  .
this is the first outfit change on the ted stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , i think .
i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
recently , the new york times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 american children are sold into sex slavery every year .
eventually , after our long journey , my family and i were reunited in south korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
across the globe , throughout the ages , our basic needs are just the same , aren &apos;t they ? &quot;
&quot; we have no freedom , &quot; they said .
a huge famine hit north korea in the mid-1990s .
extraordinary .
and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an x-ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic  UNK  , and the list can go on .
if that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
they &apos;ve also be associated with disney — —  UNK  as goofy , dumb , stupid characters .
in kathmandu , i was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
&quot; before i die , i want to plant a tree . &quot;
i did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the south korean embassy .
gardening is the most therapeutic and  UNK  act you can do , especially in the inner city .
i dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
and what  UNK  means is &quot; a dishonest politician . &quot;
i lost all hope .
i want to shine a light on slavery .
so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
as you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
he doesn &apos;t remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my ipod , conversations we had when he was four ,  UNK  on my arm on the first ever episode of  UNK  , and lady gaga &apos;s birthday .
and i cannot remember the first moment i encountered autism , but i cannot recall a day without it .
it &apos;s everywhere .
i grew up in cambridge , and one time i went into a store and i forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
in our age of increasing distractions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
it &apos;s made of asphalt , and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s raining a lot .
when they came out of the shaft , they were  UNK  wet from their own sweat .
back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
we were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
but i struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
the next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
just like  UNK  million other americans , i live in a food desert , south central los angeles , home of the  UNK  and the  UNK  .
i hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it .
then if you drive over the road , you take out the aggregates -- what we just saw here .
so i think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering .
here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and i are sitting here talking today , kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
so what happens ? in 40 years &apos; time , in the year 1900 , in the united states of america , there were  UNK  car manufacturing companies --  UNK  .
how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
we all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
and , my favorite is ,  UNK  are better looking .
thank you very much .
why didn &apos;t i walk out ? i could have left any time .
if you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit .
i want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block .
i was a doing a ph.d. at the time , trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do .
he had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
and also , the senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of singularity -- well , it was a singularity back then .
this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and i just woke up in the morning and i found it dead , and i felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
sometimes you can create potholes with that .
that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
and that title was &quot; president . &quot;
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
if anything seemed unnatural , i could be imprisoned and  UNK  .
so you got this scholarship . yep .
you never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
because of this invention , i was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in kenya ,  UNK  international school , and i &apos;m really excited about this .
many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
it &apos;s not . it &apos;s down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press .
on top of that ,  UNK  has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
they thought it was tried and tested .
and i was very proud .
tell us why your science is relevant to us .
and if i could communicate just one thing to  UNK  and to sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
so what you do -- you shut up .
so we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; what do you need ?
some people just wanted to call him king .
and , you know , it could have worked .
the dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
so we can benefit from the international community for education , english language training , job training , and more .
when something becomes  UNK  cost , it becomes massively scalable .
i got a chance to come by plane for my first time for ted .
when you look at the ripples under the cap , the ripples are moving away from us .
our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
we made it all the way to the border of  UNK  , but i had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in  UNK  .
instead , i was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man , and i was the only person on earth who could help  UNK  face his demons .
my dog is a black lab , and i drive a  UNK  odyssey  UNK  .
they are  UNK  machines .
then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt .
&quot; before i die , i want to straddle the international date line . &quot;
i realized that the man who i loved so much was going to kill me if i let him .
and finally , this  UNK  can also lead to more and more damage .
the skeletal tree limbs submerged in lake volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to  UNK  the lines .
they &apos;d been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and  UNK  cards .
okay , can you sell it ? can you look after the money ? &quot;
so with gardening , i see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
also , i realized there was a wide gap between north and south .
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
they knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks .
plus you get strawberries .
i would have told you myself that i was the last person on earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact i was a very typical victim because of my age .
the shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be  UNK  so that they can extract the gold .
it &apos;s very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos .
UNK  was the symbol of the protector and the  UNK  , and together with the cobra , symbolized the unity between upper and lower egypt .
other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the  UNK   UNK  ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend  UNK  time with the man who beat their mother .
so do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
after i paid the fine and bribe , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of  UNK  .
now if i take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one  UNK  of a second -- which is several  UNK  -- i &apos;ll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that packet of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
otherwise , that little girl isn &apos;t going to look like that little girl anymore , and surely that &apos;s as tragic as having the photo damaged .
when we first arrived , i went to have a quick look .
and the trick here is to use a single ,  UNK  sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a  UNK  — that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel — but i &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
i couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
oddly , i had been to many of these places before .
we &apos;ve had , like , 50 people come to our  UNK  and participate , and it &apos;s all volunteers .
they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture .
so what i want to do here , we gotta make this sexy .
UNK  also have tremendous historical significance .
&quot; before i die , i want to be someone &apos;s cavalry . &quot;
now , it was emotional and it was inspiring , and i &apos;ve always heard about thinking outside the box , but it wasn &apos;t until i had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened .
i worked for an italian ngo , and every single project that we set up in africa failed .
it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
image is powerful , but also image is superficial .
if you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where i lived , what jobs i took , who my friends were and where i spent christmas , i would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in  UNK  at the beginning .
instead , as einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
one of them got caught up in the water .
and everybody got insanely bored , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .
because it &apos;s very hollow , all the noise will disappear , so it &apos;s a very silent road .
the waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height , and traveled over two miles inland .
in a year , i had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , &quot; how can you do that ?
but the second answer , and what i really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; why ?
in the trenches . richard  UNK  , you are something else .
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
now , the last thing i wanted to do was leave new york , and my dream job , but i thought you made sacrifices for your  UNK  , so i agreed , and i quit my job , and  UNK  and i left manhattan together .
soon after , an organization i volunteer with , all hands volunteers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
really scared . scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
these miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of ghana .
i had no idea what life was going to be like as a north korean refugee , but i soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since north korean refugees are considered in china as illegal migrants .
peace . thank you .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for the last little while i &apos;ve been a model .
so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
this is a satellite picture showing north korea at night compared to neighbors .
five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and i put on my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and i married him .
on the left , you see our  UNK  .
and he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by  UNK  his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been  UNK  and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonderland .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
i live near this house , and i thought about how i could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood , and i also thought about something that changed my life forever .
since now , i &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking i was walking around the  UNK  , but i was sleeping in my bed .
we have zero infrastructure .
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
and so what i did in  UNK  that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days i had my first client , and i helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a  UNK  guy , and i helped him to sell to the restaurant in  UNK  , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; you the guy who helped  UNK  ? can you help us ? &quot;
but unfortunately i have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired nyu ph.d. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the  UNK  models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were  UNK  .
there is not a day that goes by that i don &apos;t think of these many beautiful ,  UNK  people i &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
five years ago , i experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be alice in wonderland .
we might produce the next george washington  UNK  .
yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
and there were all sorts of suggestions on the table , which might have made it .
thinking about death  UNK  your life .
i remember looking into their tired ,  UNK  eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
but what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
so i figured that the problem is the solution .
here &apos;s me at a slumber party a few days before i shot french  UNK  .
he told me two things .
please -- don &apos;t tell me i &apos;m normal .
i want them to take it , but at the same time , i want them to take back their health . &quot;
don &apos;t just tell me that you study  UNK  , but tell me that you study  UNK  , which is the  UNK  structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating osteoporosis .
i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
in tibetan culture , they are performing very important sky burials . in places like tibet , there are no places to bury the dead , or wood to  UNK  them , so these  UNK  provide a natural disposal system .
but i will do a trial .
we started dating , and he loved everything about me , that i was smart , that i &apos;d gone to harvard , that i was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job .
when my hand slips , i suddenly remember a miner i had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
that was awkward .
i read a diary of this poor senator , who just keeps coming back , &quot; still on this subject . &quot;
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
and this was my first time in afghanistan .
thank you .
we take photos constantly .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
i am on this stage because i am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
my family believes in me .
i do have too many  UNK  heels which i never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that i get is the free stuff that i get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
these girls were so lucky .
one in three american women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life , and the cdc reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million .
saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the  UNK  when you grow up .
like me , they are dreaming big .
so that &apos;s what we did here . you see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . that &apos;s what we know from practice .
UNK  proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
although i often wondered about the outside world , i thought i would spend my entire life in north korea , until everything suddenly changed .
they are hardly monogamous .
there was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the taliban , despite the risks .
if some of the women were really horrified when i came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but i &apos;ll find out later on twitter .
they said , that &apos;s ridiculous , you can &apos;t call him president .
the ripples should be moving towards us .
some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
the kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the north korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we north korean people need .
he was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
i would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
and he was very , very sorry .
thank you .
and after three weeks of debate , in the end the senate did not cave in .
you see , i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
do they know where we live ?
&quot; i &apos;m helping the north korean people . &quot;
this is a family portrait .
which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
this is the  UNK  river , which serves as a part of the border between north korea and china .
were we being followed ?
she &apos;s not north korean . &quot;
now , like doc  UNK  , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of  UNK  photography , and i realized that all the gigabytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time-lapse and  UNK  , and we look at those ripples . remember , the time between each of those ripples is only a few  UNK  of a second .
these north koreans were not so lucky .
however , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor ,  UNK  and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
like ahmed . that &apos;s not his real name , and i cannot show you his face , but ahmed is the father of one of my students .
power  UNK  also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in china , just across the river from my home .
settling down in south korea was a lot more challenging than i had expected .
soon after , when i was walking past a train station , i saw something terrible that i can &apos;t erase from my memory .
i can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but i can &apos;t see much else .
thank you .
as we started down the path , we pushed aside the  UNK  blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so i hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
it could take months .
and still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
and who &apos;s going to take him seriously if he &apos;s got a silly little title like president of the united states of america ?
but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point i want to leave you on , is that the title , president of the united states of america , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
he shares it  UNK  and he shares it regardless .
the neurologist &apos;s test is non-invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot .
now , it wasn &apos;t until this point that i realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of new york around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
for her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gift back to him , something he could look at again , something he remembered from before that wasn &apos;t still scarred from that day in march when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed .
and my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
&quot; before i die , i want to live off the grid . &quot;
for instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , beverly hills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
that &apos;s enough space to plant  UNK  million tomato plants .
they &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in october and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and excite us about your content .
but today , more than three million girls are in school in afghanistan .
so why are  UNK  important ? first of all , they provide vital ecological services . they clean up .
i  UNK  a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids .
instead , this example slide by  UNK  brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of  UNK  are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the eiffel tower .
and the first answer is , &quot; i don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
it was the only way we both could be educated .
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived .
local , passionate people . that &apos;s who you have applauded .
and after a few months went by , i realized that he was different .
what i will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me .
due to  UNK  , due to  UNK  light , due to  UNK  , this binder , this  UNK  , the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink , and if it shrinks , it gets  UNK  , and it  UNK  from the aggregates .
thank you .
this is  UNK  . when his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
i even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and i &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
my topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question i &apos;m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : why does she stay ?
since my family couldn &apos;t understand chinese , i thought my family was going to be arrested .
UNK  lived and reigned in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the smallest things , like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between .
so basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit .
and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition ,  UNK  tests are  UNK  .
we have eight species of  UNK  that occur in kenya , of which six are highly threatened with extinction .
together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
they will come the first day and they see the  UNK  , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a résumé and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the president of the united states , but your résumé reads , &quot; underwear model : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine  UNK  .
now , i cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where i &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
and try and use this campaign to expose these  UNK  who are  UNK  as national heroes .
and here &apos;s where those guns come in .
but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
normality  UNK  the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
thank you .
but many die .
when i was researching this talk , i found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the united states , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
you can be extraordinary .
i see young people and they want to work , but they &apos;re in this thing where they &apos;re caught up -- i see kids of color and they &apos;re just on this track that &apos;s designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
after another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people  UNK  .
a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
for some of them , it &apos;s given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
now you can learn three interesting things from this .
you have to create a new profession .
patronizing , i treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; no , no , cameron , i want to be a model , &quot; well then i say , &quot; be my boss . &quot;
i want to look into corruption in afghanistan through a work called &quot; payback &quot; and  UNK  a police officer , set up a fake  UNK  on the street of kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the kabul police department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100  UNK  on our behalf .
it could take an hour . it could take weeks .
in fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
so the last question people ask me is , &quot; what is it like to be a model ? &quot;
that &apos;s why i cofounded  UNK  , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
she said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? &quot;
the city came down on me , and basically gave me a citation saying that i had to remove my garden , which this citation was turning into a warrant .
from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates , and just as the limbs are affected in parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
death is something that we &apos;re often discouraged to talk about or even think about , but i &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
you &apos;d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
they got their title of respectability .
areas like her husband and her face , which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix , we could just put them together in one good photo , and remake the whole photo .
so what we can do is use steel wool just to clean  UNK  , and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces , and these very small pieces we can mix to the  UNK  .
so , what we do is we send that bullet , those packet of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchronization , and from the gigabytes of data , we  UNK  weave together to create those  UNK  i showed you .
and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
but you have to maintain it .
under the taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
and now what she &apos;s looking at in new york are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in new york .
samuel is 16 . he &apos;s tall . he &apos;s very handsome .
the journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
&quot; why didn &apos;t you tell us ? &quot; &quot; you never asked . &quot;
so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
as the chinese officer approached my family , i  UNK  stood up , and i told him that these are deaf and dumb people that i was  UNK  .
but i &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it &apos;s great that i got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and i &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i got my first job , or maybe i wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how i paid for college , which seems so important right now .
it doesn &apos;t exist .
so i got an old car battery , an indicator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps  UNK  when they want to turn right or left . it blinks .
many north koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
during taliban years , i remember there were times i would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
they are far from being extinct .
i was given a slap in the face reading a book , &quot; small is beautiful , &quot; written by  UNK  , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
doc  UNK  inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple , and exposure just a millionth of a second .
as i stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
we need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
driving down a road in ghana with partners of free the slaves , a fellow  UNK  on a  UNK  suddenly sped up to our  UNK  and tapped on the window .
i live in new york , and last year , of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and  UNK  , 86 percent of them were black and latino , and most of them were young men .
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
when i returned to afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
and i figured , this has to stop .
when i was seven years old , i saw my first public execution , but i thought my life in north korea was normal .
one was that he , too , had just graduated from an ivy league school , and that he worked at a very impressive wall street bank .
what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
thank you .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
see , i have a legacy in south central .
and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
how can you do — ? &quot; and i said , &quot; i do something very , very , very difficult .
we don &apos;t work from offices .
he took everyone &apos;s i.d. cards , and he started asking them questions .
my family was not poor , and myself , i had never experienced hunger .
&quot; before i die , i want to sing for millions . &quot;
so these  UNK  tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non-invasive .
and let that be your weapon of choice .
and i always just say , &quot; oh , i was  UNK  , &quot; but that means nothing .
&quot; just in the nick of time to save the  UNK  people from starvation . &quot;
after they finished questioning me , one official said to another , &quot; this was a false report .
the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
we &apos;re talking to them about appreciating  UNK  , about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
now we teach entrepreneurship to  UNK  in  UNK  , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of richard branson &apos;s autobiography , and the task of the  UNK  is to  UNK  , in the first two pages of richard branson &apos;s autobiography how many times richard uses the word &quot; i &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
i &apos;d also note that i &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
and it didn &apos;t have much more grandeur than the term &quot; foreman &quot; or &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
my father was listening to bbc news on his small , gray radio .
i had no idea i was falling into crazy love , that i was walking  UNK  into a carefully laid physical , financial and psychological trap .
you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
so when i was writing this talk , i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , &quot; look i &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
i was helping clean the  UNK  , the communal  UNK  , the huge giant  UNK  .
you know , he changed his mind when he came back , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
and especially if you then ride with your bicycle , and pass these cars , then that &apos;s not very nice .
first question to answer for us : so what ?
and here i am today .
so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside .
and where else can the  UNK   UNK  go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! i &apos;ve done jihad , and i &apos;m rich . &quot;
and because the engineers that i &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , i want to summarize with an equation .
i &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
it &apos;s about making space for reflection and contemplation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
the other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
the speech actually becomes quieter and more  UNK  after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
as i looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the processing lab , i couldn &apos;t help but think as a  UNK  that i could fix that tear and mend that scratch , and i knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
and when we &apos;re backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
like the others , i wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic ,  UNK  band , and i can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the  UNK  square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
her photos were found by her husband &apos;s colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood , and they &apos;d recognized him .
i thought my life was over , but i managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
my friend got to come with me .
i thought , this is how nature paints a photo , one  UNK  frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
see , i &apos;m an artist .
the first principle of aid is respect .
then what you do is you heat up the steel , you melt the  UNK  , and the  UNK  will flow into these  UNK  , and the stones are again fixed to the surface .
one day , my worst nightmare came true , when i was caught by the chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
he needed them to feel protected .
gardening is my graffiti . i grow my art .
and then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
when i was a teenager , i was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; sorry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
