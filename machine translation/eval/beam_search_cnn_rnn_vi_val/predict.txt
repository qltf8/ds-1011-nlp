when i was a little kid , i thought that the money was the best country in the world and i often say , &quot; we have nothing . &quot;
i was very proud of my country .
in school , we &apos;re spending a lot of time to learn about the president of our lives of the world ,  UNK   UNK  , but not from the outside world , except for the united states , and the united states is the enemy of our japan .
although i &apos;ve been wondering if i didn &apos;t know what the world looks like , but i still think i &apos;m going to live in life in my life in my life .
when i was seven , i saw people &apos;s open for the first time my life in my life , but i still thought my life is still quite normal .
my family &apos;s not poor , and myself are not hungry .
but one day in 1995 , 1995 , i brought a mom home with a fourth of one of my grandmother .
and she wrote a text : when she read it , it &apos;s about five of the families who don &apos;t even have their children on this anymore , because it &apos;s because you don &apos;t have nothing to eat .
all the way , on the floor , and we can love to feel like death .
i was shocked .
because it &apos;s the first time i know that my grandparents are suffering .
not long after that , when i walked across a station , i saw a scene that i was astonished i could never forget .
in the lower mayor of a woman who &apos;s still healthy with a baby and baby sister , and you know , baby sister looked at her face .
but nobody had helped them , because all of these were all their own gods and their family .
in the &apos; 90s , north korea .
it &apos;s more than a million million deaths in prison , and many of them survives .
it gets more frequent than anything , so everything around me in the dark when i shine light into the light from china to a river .
i &apos;m always asking myself why they have electricity .
this is an aerial photo from north korea .
this is a river where it &apos;s the border between north and north korea .
you can see  UNK   UNK  , so there &apos;s a couple of north korea from china to china .
but a lot of people died .
and i saw saw them on the river .
i can &apos;t tell you how reassured i &apos;ve been away from north korea .
now , i just thought i would have to go away from a short family .
i would never imagined that i would have to go to 14 years .
in china , the lives of a boy stuck outside of death as a tough family .
i couldn &apos;t figure out what happened to a syrian refugee family north from north korea , but i &apos;m not going to realize that it &apos;s not really hard , but it &apos;s not really dangerous , but because it &apos;s threatened because of syrian refugee immigrants from north korea .
i always live in a fear of breaking that my identity is going to be discovered , and i will be paid to me in north korea .
one day , i had a nightmare to become a police , and i got a police officer , and turned into police officers to police .
somebody who told them told me that i was north koreans , so they were able to check the chinese and i ask a lot of questions .
i excitedly incredibly frightening , and i felt like myself .
because if they saw what nature doesn &apos;t , i &apos;m going to get into the cochlea and get paid water .
i thought i &apos;d dedicate my life , but i &apos;m trying to control my emotions and my answer .
after being asked , one of the police told the cops , there was a liar .
it &apos;s not north korean . &quot;
and they released me .
some of korea north korea in brazil came to the foreign border to support , but many of them were arrested by the police and china got paid water .
these girls have been blessed .
because although he was arrested , but at the end of the day , was due to the ground from the inside .
but north korea . it &apos;s not blessed .
every year , there were plenty of north korea in china and they were paid sick , where they were tortured , or tortured .
when i was very lucky , because i was released a lot of people to my knees .
korean north korea had to hide his identity and to struggle with a tragedy .
even when she introduced the chinese school and find a job , then their lives could be completely different in a different way .
that &apos;s the reason why 10 years after all of our identity , decided to go to south korea , to start a new again .
settling of life lives .
because in korean , english is very important , so i started to learn english language , my third language .
i also realized that gap a huge gap between north korea and north korea .
we were all elated , but we became very different from the control of  UNK  .
i &apos;ve been through a crisis crisis .
i &apos;m in south korea or north korea ?
i &apos;m from ?
suddenly , i didn &apos;t have a country to be a  UNK  country .
although to cope with the lives in south korea .
and starting to learn to prepare for college .
and yet , i &apos;m just going to have to
the north koreans came out of the money that i sending money to the family , for family , and to punish them , they would have to move my family to an area in the countryside .
in order to quickly get out of that out of that , and i started to plan my family planning .
north korea has to overcome  UNK  gaps to overwhelm .
because border guards from north to korea , almost to korea , so i flew to china to go back to the south west north korea .
because my family doesn &apos;t know a chinese , so i have to go to the nearest year 2000 in china .
it took a bus on a bus , and a couple of weeks ago , we started flying .
one time , our car was left and driven by a police officer .
he tried everything , all of his people , and started pouring .
because my family doesn &apos;t understand chinese , so i thought they would be arrested .
when the police station came to near china , i stood up and stood up and said to him that he was a deaf person who i was blind .
he looked at me thinking , but luckily , he was lucky .
and we went on to the border borders , but i had to use the whole amount of money that i had to pay for the bribe to guard the guards .
however , after we were crossed the border , my family was arrested into the word because i wanted to cross the border .
and after i applied the bills and gave the bribe , gave my money into a month .
that &apos;s my time in my life .
i &apos;ve been making enough new ways to bring my family , and i &apos;ve been successful as they were left with us , just by south korea .
i went to return to the middle of the middle of the  UNK  and  UNK  police , trying to figure out how to get rid of that , but i couldn &apos;t afford to pay for the bribe or to pay for the bribe .
i was completely .
right at the moment , there &apos;s a man who said , &quot; what ?
i was incredibly surprised when it was completely strange to me .
in english alone , and he says , &quot; i &apos;ve told him a photo for my family . i don &apos;t think of a man , not a man , but i &apos;ve been able to pay for the rest of the money i &apos;ve lost all the rest of my family and parents .
so i thank you for his heart , and i ask , &quot; why is why i helped me ? &quot;
&quot; i don &apos;t help , &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m going to help north korea . &quot;
i realized that was a very significant meaningful moment in my life .
the good word for strangers is turned into hope that i hope to both symbols and others in north korea , but we need it , and he showed me the good news and the support of strangers .
after the end of a long journey , and my family was reunited with the korean of freedom to be a civil war .
a lot of north korea north korea is divided with my family , and when they came to another country , they start to start with less and less .
so we can get from the international aid community , for training and english , and listening to other areas .
we also can play the role as the bridge between being in north korea with the outside world , because there &apos;s a lot of us inside us with the family members .
i was very fortunate fortunate enough to get a lot of help and inspire the rest of my life , so i &apos;d like to share them with my country to give me a chance to develop an opportunity to develop with international development .
i believe that you will see increasingly more  UNK  million people in the world , even the ted stage .
thank you .
i &apos;m just a request today .
please don &apos;t tell me me .
now i want to introduce you to my brother .
UNK  pierson , 22  UNK  , handsome , handsome .
i &apos;m not saying , but spoken word poetry in the way that the best teachers can &apos;t do .
UNK  knows love .
he shared it in the conditions .
she was not .
you don &apos;t care about the religious religion , and understand that , you know , i don &apos;t lie lied .
when i sing those grains from our childhood , we tried to remember from the ones that i couldn &apos;t do , and i &apos;m reminded of a little bit about what i &apos;m saying : how we know about the brain , and we know , and we know , god knows , we know .
samuel  UNK  .
i have a perfectly background .
but there &apos;s also a natural selection .
i &apos;m not sure if i turn my turn into my pocket -- i &apos;m not sure , but i remember lying on the record of my ipod songs on the ipod , my talk , we &apos;re talking about four years old .
but this sounds great . isn &apos;t it ?
but most people don &apos;t agree .
and in fact , the mind of my mind , i &apos;m not afraid to uncomfortable with normal society , and they often often they are often controlled .
but what i experienced the heart of my soul and my soul is more powerful than that , although it &apos;s true , even though i &apos;m not going to be seen as usual , and that means that it &apos;s just extraordinary : incredible people -- incredible people .
and you &apos;re not familiar with phrases with phrases , but it &apos;s a developmental disorder where the ability to interact with society and social networking , sometimes .
a million people have personal individuals , which is why the other is sam .
and all over the world , 20 minutes 20 minutes has a diagnosis of autism , and even though it &apos;s one of the fastest developmental disorders in the world , because we don &apos;t know how to treat them .
and i couldn &apos;t remember the first time with them with autism , but i couldn &apos;t remember one day .
i was three years old when i was born and i was fascinated by that there was a new person in my life .
and after several months , i realized that i was different .
she &apos;s a lot .
you don &apos;t want to play like other kids , and in fact , i don &apos;t seem to be interested in what i &apos;m .
UNK  and live in your own world , with your own rules , and you can see pleasure in the most beautiful things , like handing around the dining room and stare into the washing machine and everything in your eyes .
when i grew up , i became more different and different .
but beyond the anger and their anger and  UNK  to understand the fortress , something that &apos;s really unique : real , instinct and  UNK  , an ounce of ignorance , not a little boy , not to have a bias , not to have a bias , but not to have a bias biases , not lying .
incredible .
my father , i couldn &apos;t deny some some tough moments in my family , but i would love to feel like myself .
but i took my memory back to the things that i &apos;ve learned about my character , character and romantic love to realize that this is what i &apos;m going to take away from ordinary .
the normal beauty of beauty is that the difference between us and how different we don &apos;t have means that we &apos;re in something wrong .
it just means that there &apos;s a right word .
and if i can convey a platform for the  UNK  and for derek to you , that &apos;s not normal .
you can incredible incredible .
since they have autism or no difference between us -- we have a gift in our gift , and frankly , in the pursuit of pursuit , the pursuit of pursuit of success is the greatest potential .
the great opportunity of great progress , and for change , when we try to become more like a person .
please don &apos;t tell me .
thank you .
maybe you all agree with me here is a nice street .
it was built from asphalt , and it &apos;s a plastic packaging that &apos;s going on it , but it &apos;s not exactly the same time , but it &apos;s not especially in today , but especially today because it &apos;s not today .
then you can get water in the yellow line .
and especially if you like a bike , and over the car , it &apos;s not really cool .
but secondly , noise also noise lots of noise .
it &apos;s a  UNK  material , if we are doing the same as the netherlands , near the near urban view , we want to be silent .
the solution problem is that the roads from asphalt asphalt .
leaven is a biomaterial that we &apos;re currently taking place in most of the netherlands , most of them in the netherlands , and there &apos;s holes in the water and even the water , and through holes .
and noise noise disappeared too late .
because it &apos;s full of noise , it will vanish away , so the road is so silent .
there &apos;s also a lot of  UNK  , uncomfortable , this is the kind of  UNK   UNK  , which is  UNK  .
what is the bottleneck ? you can see this red line .
first of all , you &apos;ve got a lot more , and then more , more , , more , more , and more , and more and more , and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more -- and then they &apos;re -- oh , i &apos;m not going to do it .
but they can imagine the window of your car . so you &apos;re not happy .
and at the situation , it &apos;s going to make a lot more .
sometimes they build these chicken .
oh . he was ready .
mallory , of course , could be a problem , but we have solutions .
in fact , you see here in this material , there &apos;s a  UNK  .
it &apos;s plastic , like i said , you just have a little bit of weird sticky .
under the air of the weather , the seawater , the chemical chemical chemical , this plastic  UNK  cellulose between  UNK  and  UNK  these cells , and so forth , it &apos;s so stressful , it &apos;s going to break down the pore .
and if you drove around the road , you destroy the destruction of these cubes -- like we &apos;ve seen here .
to deal with this problem , we &apos;ve devised materials materials .
if we created this material , we could figure out the solutions .
what we can do is  UNK  with levers steel to  UNK  and we cut them out of the oven , and we hid these little bits of plastic .
so we have these panels with steel very  UNK  .
then you need a machine , as you can see here , is a machine -- to cook -- a  UNK  .
the sensors can make heat , especially hot heat .
but what you do , is hot steel , you can run plastic and plastic , and they &apos;re going to  UNK  into these little red swarms , and they &apos;re going to go back to the other end of the  UNK  .
today i &apos;m taking a moment in the moment because i &apos;m not able to make any noise from a  UNK  stage .
the same vent system has exactly the same system .
i &apos;ve tried to elaborate into the oven , so i &apos;m going to check it .
this is the blood .
i said we invented an industrial model of  UNK  .
in the laboratory we tried too many samples , and then , they actually saw the results . and they thought , &quot; well , how do we do it . &quot;
and they gave us a  UNK  guessing , 400 meters of  UNK  , and this is  UNK  , we had to build a similar experiment .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done here in front of the road , and we &apos;ve been able to do it , and of course , and of course , that there is going to be in many years that the years won &apos;t .
we took a sample from this street , and we tried them in the lab .
so we magicians  UNK  , and we put it together , it  UNK  them with magnetic materials , and then they stop again .
we can do it again .
and actually , concluding conclusion from this research is , if we reduce the four years of four times a standard computer -- this is a big version that we grew it up to  UNK  -- so if it &apos;s four years old , if we save four hundred years ago , we can shorten the same amount of torque .
well , in addition to my body , i can tell us that we &apos;ve created a materials that we use with synthetic , steel , steel , using the flow of co2 , to actually increase the flow of the flow of co2 .
now you may be wondering if it &apos;s effective or ineffective .
we &apos;ve got this pet here . it &apos;s pretty warm .
it must have to be to people before us to see how you can improve the therapy , therapy .
but let me see .
look .
thank you .
today i &apos;m here today to talk about a question that &apos;s confusing to me .
the subject of violence is violence , and my question question is asking questions : why is it : why ?
why why do women stay stay in front of them ?
i &apos;m not a psychopath doctor , not a veteran service to a society or a  UNK  expert .
i &apos;m just a woman .
when i was 22 years old , i graduated at school college .
i moved to new york city when the first job was writing and writing for the editorial cartoonist .
the first time i have the apartment , the american express american express your own , and my father had great secrets .
and that &apos;s the gun , this gun is being sold by a  UNK   UNK  month , and by the time i &apos;ve been shot by the man who thought i was wondering , and over again , over and over again .
the man i love all the kisses of death and my father death by telling me how i told you that i couldn &apos;t remember .
i came here to tell you about the love of a love , one of the  UNK  of  UNK  of love and  UNK  women and millions of men have women .
this is your story .
i &apos;m not a consultant a domestic violence .
i have a bachelor &apos;s degree in english , and business business school .
i &apos;ve done all my career at work in the u.s. , 500 miles of r &amp; amp ; amp ; d ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
i married my married husband has been 20 years 20 years , and she has seven children .
my dog is the kind of journalism , and i  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
so the first thing i want to talk to you about is the violence that happens to everyone in new countries , everyone , religions .
it &apos;s happening .
and the second thing i want to say is that people think that the family is happening with women , is the women &apos;s issues .
no .
more than 85 percent of the men are men , and domestic violence is only within the relationships , long-term , long-term , long-term ,  UNK  , in the end , in the end , in the end of the city , we want to believe that violence is believing in violence , which is why violence against the violence is the cause of violence , which is the cause of violence , which is the cause of violence and despair , which is why the family of family violence .
and i thought myself myself , i am a man on earth , with the man who beat his father , but i was a jewish victim .
i was 22 years old , in the united states united states , was 16 years old , from 24 / 11 to my grandmother who had become a domestic violence against women , and over 500 million people , and she killed these women in the united states , and by killing people in the united states .
i was used to be a pretty good because i didn &apos;t know what it was about to know about the family , but let &apos;s follow it .
i met a  UNK  in one night , and the rains .
he sat beside me in new york city , and he talked to me .
he told me about two things .
he was a photographer , and i just went to school and  UNK  schools , and he worked at the end of a very unusual bank governor wall street .
but the thing that i picked up with me was in the first type of wood was to be smart , and he looks like a  UNK  guy .
he got the big hills of these bubbles , the twin towers , and the big bangs were like  UNK  , and he &apos;s so sweet .
one of the most brilliant thing that has been done , since the beginning is , beginning to create a illusion that i &apos;m enthusiastic as a promise .
he tried to figure this out at the beginning of the time .
and we started , and he was love and i love that every man , i &apos;m smart , that i chose to harvard , i went to harvard , and i &apos;m asking , i &apos;m passionate about it .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood , and my dream dream dream .
UNK  faith , as a writer and a woman who has never seen before .
and he also creates the sense of the wonder of what we believe in the secret of his secrets , that he &apos;s like a young kid who is at the age of the age of  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  , and his  UNK  and his  UNK  , his  UNK  and his  UNK  him , and he and his  UNK  and his  UNK  and his  UNK  and his  UNK  and his life , and he and his  UNK  and his  UNK  and his  UNK  and his  UNK  and his  UNK  , and he and his  UNK  , and
that explains how degrees in  UNK  and  UNK  in the wall street future and the future , the great power of him .
if you tell me that man , intelligent man , funny people , i loved writing a day , i &apos;m forced to me , or not my hands , how much i &apos;m going to forget , my head , how much i &apos;m alive , how much i am , what i &apos;m going to do in the end of my head , my head , my head , i &apos;m going to leave you with my head , and i &apos;m going to go down to the end of the violence , and i &apos;m going
i didn &apos;t know that the first phase of any relationship was violence against sex and  UNK  .
i don &apos;t know that the second phase are isolated victims .
now , let &apos;s not go back home a day and say , &quot; hey , don &apos;t know , it &apos;s all about  UNK  and juliet , and it &apos;s great , but i need to talk to go to the next phase , and i say , &quot; i want to have split my life . &quot;
see ,  UNK   UNK  work on fridays and he said to me that he thought today &apos;s dream of today , his dream and his talk , he said , he said , because he claimed me , because he claimed me , because he claimed me , because he claimed me , because he was really successful , because he claimed he was willing to stand up in the city , and he wanted to go to northern ireland , and he wanted to go to northern ireland , and he wanted to go to the streets of
now , the final thing i want to do is to leave new york city and dream my dream , but i think you &apos;ve got to consider for your partner , so i agree , and so i &apos;m going to marry me , and together , and over and over and over again .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve been in love with love , that i &apos;m forced to follow my first flight , which has been morally and morally .
the next step in this violence is the threat of violence and violence and how she responds .
since here , the gun goes into the gun .
when we moved to new new england -- you know , it &apos;s based on  UNK  safe .
he stayed a thousand trees in his parking lot .
a tree under the bed of our bed and his third group has always been in the middle .
and he says that he needs the trees , because those holes are left over the past when he was a kid .
he needed to feel them .
but these trees are actually a one message for me , and although he hasn &apos;t touched the side of my hand , but my life in my life in every minute every day .
UNK   UNK  attacks in my wedding .
it was seven o &apos;clock in my morning when i was wearing .
i &apos;m  UNK  on  UNK  ,  UNK  into writing , and i &apos;ve seen  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , and i &apos;m fascinated by my  UNK  as a result , and i took two arms around the continent and i would ruin my silence , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling , yelling ,
next year later , you know , i have on my side , and i dress with my mom , and my mom , married .
for me what happens , i &apos;m sure we will live forever because i love him and i love too much .
and he was incredibly upset .
he actually was very nervous , because  UNK  and family planning with me .
it &apos;s an antidote to an  UNK  , and he will never hurt me .
it has occurred again in  UNK  .
on the first time , i was driving a way to find a beach and i got to shake him , picked up on a head on my head .
a few days later , when driving driving home after home , and he was tired of the car , and he sold the bread in my eyes .
and then  UNK   UNK  i hit a two weeks for two weeks straight for two months and after half a year .
i mistake when i thought that i was the only way and i am alone in this alone .
a third part of violence in american violence or domestic violence in a certain period of time and a few months reporting shows millions of children , 15 years later , 15 million .
so i &apos;m actually in a very good company .
back to my question : why am i ?
the answer is easy .
i don &apos;t know him .
he &apos;s  UNK  his head to his head , and i &apos;m down to the san diego , my daughter , the key to my car , driving my car driving my car when he drove me down to the front of me , when i &apos;m pouring in front of me , when i &apos;m pouring up in front of coffee cups , i &apos;ve never been scooped in front of an hour , and i &apos;ve never been scooped in front of the day .
instead , i am a woman in love with a man with a man , and i am the only one who believes that earth can help us with the earth &apos;s face of evil .
the other question that people ask or is , why is it ?
why i didn &apos;t walk ?
for me , that &apos;s the sad question , and most of us , but we know some of the things that you don &apos;t know : dangerous , dangerous burden to leave a violence .
because the final step in the aftermath of death is killed her death .
more than 70 percent of violence against domestic violence after the end of civilian victims , after her father was left , because after the time , then they didn &apos;t lose their dignity .
but the other condition were regarded as a result , even after the rest of the married ; it was from the ministry of finance , the lack of the ministry of the ministry of the education system , to get their families and raise their kids , they &apos;re often constrained by the time they had not been monitoring by the time .
and we have continued to wonder , why is it ?
i can quit my father , because a  UNK  hit the end of the occupation .
i realized that man was a very loved thing . i would kill him .
so i broke my silence .
i tell tell people : the bars wing , my friends , friends and family , my friends , totally unfamiliar , unfamiliar , and i stand here today , because i &apos;m here today because you &apos;re helping me .
we have this notion of stereotypes , but as the terrifying , the woman from the women , the hurt .
the question , &quot; why ? stay ? &quot;
it &apos;s a certain amount of people , &quot; this is my father &apos;s condition , &quot; as if the victim chooses to choose to destroy us .
but since the book came from &quot; love , &quot; i &apos;ve heard hundreds of stories from women and men and women who are left , but learn a lesson .
because the truth is i was a typical victim of violence in my family violence who was a dead victim .
i married married a nice man man and good , and we had them together .
i have kids in my lab and i have a  UNK  .
what i never did was , again , was a gun by my head , who said that i loved him .
right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; oh , this is great , &quot; oh , &quot; oh , &quot; oh , she &apos;s , how is it all this time . &quot;
i &apos;m sure sure of you who are listening to the person who are being abused and abused who are abused , or when they &apos;re impaired or brother .
your body can influence your daughters , your daughter , your best friend of your right now .
i &apos;d like to finish the love story of love with my silence .
i &apos;m talking about silence .
this is how i help other others , and this is the last request of my final victims .
let &apos;s talk about what you heard here .
silence is scary .
you have the power of violence against the state of  UNK  by a minute .
we victims .
we need you to understand the secret of the secret family .
the wolves popped by the day of the day , by talking about it , but with your kids , your colleagues , your friends , your friends and your friends .
and they write their lives as the happy , happy , the future future .
the signal transmission of violence and lies the  UNK  of  UNK  , reduced it down to the road .
together we can make sleep sleep with our families and our family and become safe and  UNK  .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about a particularly special group .
there &apos;s about 10,000 birds in the world .
UNK  is one of the most vulnerable groups .
when you see a  UNK  ken like this , the first thing that pops up in your head , you know , it &apos;s unfortunate creatures , it &apos;s ugly disgusting , to eat and eat , you know , it &apos;s implicit , you know , and you &apos;re grumpy .
i want to change my perception . i want to change the feeling that you enjoy for these birds , because they need to be our compassion .
i &apos;m going to tell you why .
first of all , why do they have bad ?
when charles darwin crossed the pacific coast from  UNK   UNK  , he saw the  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  , he said , &quot; these birds are  UNK  with  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  to  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot; designed to  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;
you can &apos;t get  UNK  than hatred , and that &apos;s charles darwin . charles darwin .
you know , he had seen the idea when he came back , let me tell you why .
they &apos;ve been hacked with disney hall called  UNK  , characters , stupid .
more recently , if you &apos;re watching news in kenya -- -- these are the features that correspond to the  UNK  .
i want to resist you why ?
it &apos;s not  UNK  for the environment .
UNK  doesn &apos;t help prevent the infection of disease .
they almost not a  UNK  .
they were extinct .
and , what i &apos;m interested in is , but it is more  UNK  in the more .
there are two species on this planet .
the  UNK   UNK  are found found in the united states , like  UNK  and  UNK   UNK  , and  UNK  sheep , where the world is 16 .
so , why is it important ? well , they &apos;re essential , they &apos;re essential essential .
they &apos;re really natural .
they  UNK  the bodies down .
they kill them to kill them to  UNK  the kidney  UNK  that they curable and spread the vast amounts of pollutants and  UNK  animals and other animals for other animals .
but most recent research has shown shown in areas where the areas of  UNK  areas like  UNK   UNK  takes about three times three times the size of time , and the vast majority of these contagion is the transmission of transmission transmission .
UNK  has an historic history of importance .
they had been  UNK  with the ancient culture .
UNK  is the symbol of protection and  UNK  , and his mother ,  UNK  them with the  UNK  of  UNK  &amp; amp ;
in the middle of the  UNK  , the  UNK  ,  UNK  , , ,  UNK  the to the 10  UNK  10  UNK  10
in culture culture , they are very important to stay in places like they are , and they don &apos;t choose to choose to die , or otherwise , they have  UNK  , so , so they have the natural resources , a natural system .
so what is concurrency ?
we have eight  UNK  species in kenya , in the six endangered species with endangered species .
the reason is that they were reading , they were reading because of the  UNK  between the world and the wild community .
in south , countries like india and pakistan , there are four types of  UNK  , which have been listed in these endangered species that have been worse for them to be less than 10 or 15 years ago .
this drug banned banned dysfunction in india .
so there &apos;s no  UNK  , there &apos;s no doubt about the size of the parts of the region of a  UNK  area of garbage as if you have a mask , you have an enormous amount of ticking bomb  UNK  .
in kenya , there was a big field in africa in africa with  UNK   UNK  in africa will be built in  UNK  .
i &apos;m not going to prevent the wind , but we need to collaborate with , because wind keeps birds .
they &apos;re clouds .
in west africa have a  UNK  mall  UNK  to serve to serve the  UNK  mayor and the  UNK  .
so what did we do ? we were studying these studies . we were sending signals that they signals into the signal .
we &apos;re trying to identify the basic root system , and it &apos;s where they &apos;re talking about .
we can see that they move on a variety of different countries , so if you only black holes in the region , this may not work for you .
we need to collaborate with the state level .
we are working with local communities communities .
we are telling them about what the  UNK  is for both the value for the value of the great honor of creatures and these creatures that benefit them .
how are you going to help you to become an active human beings , create a voice . you can write a government for your government and telling them that we need to get these volunteers .
when you step away from this room , you have to get information from the  UNK  , birds , for your family , your children , your neighbor , your neighbor belongs to your neighbor .
they &apos;re very impressive . charles darwin famously said , because he looked at the time they saw that they didn &apos;t seem to be able to see the eyes .
in kenya , this world is going to be more than if it &apos;s not the amazing thing .
thank you very much .
when i was 11 years old , i woke up one morning when i woke up listening to my house .
my father was listening to hear the bbc of his chicks .
he was a big smiley face of smiling , it was very unusual because he was doing it .
he &apos;s up : &quot; the taliban has gone . &quot;
i &apos;m not clear to understand what i can see , i &apos;m very excited .
&quot; you can actually go to school . &quot;
one morning morning i couldn &apos;t forget .
a school .
you know , the taliban came to afghanistan from when i was 13 and 40 years old .
in five years later , i dress up as a son to go to my son with me just a secret school because i just got shot out of a house .
that &apos;s the only way we can to learn .
every day , we crossed the path of nowhere to our choice .
we &apos;re hidden in the hours of hours every day we think we &apos;re just going to shop .
and she &apos;s going to get home in a home , it &apos;s more than we us in a living room .
it &apos;s pretty warm in winter of hot summer , but hot summer .
we all know the risk of dying of our teachers , teachers and parents .
there &apos;s a couple of times , a quarter of a school closed once a taliban for the taliban .
we always wondered what we knew .
what do they have ?
do you know what ?
we were very afraid , but nevertheless , we wanted to go to school .
i &apos;m fortunate very fortunate to raise a family in honor family and respect to school .
my grandfather was a real revelation .
it was totally wrong to get rid of a prison from afghanistan , afghanistan to his daughter , and my daughter went to school , and he got his father .
my mother education has become a teacher .
she .
she expected two years ago to stop our house to girls and girls and girls in girls .
and this is my father &apos;s father who was the first family in his family education .
no doubt that her female will be educated education , including his daughter , despite his daughter , despite the dangers , despite the dangers .
for him , his children is not much greater than that .
in the taliban , i remember that there were moments of outrage in our lives , and we were not going to see the future .
i excitedly wanted to learn from school , but my father , he said , &quot; listen , darling , you could take your eyes on your life .
the money is lost .
but it will forever be forever with us , and if we are forced to get the money , we will do it .
so what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m 22 22 .
i was raised in a country country developed abandoned attacks .
less than six percent of the woman i &apos;ve learned from high school high school , and if my family was not about my career , i became one of them .
but yet , i &apos;m standing up in front of a college student .
when i went back to afghanistan , my grandfather , who was killed by his granddaughter for his daughter , was one of my first friends .
he not only had to talk about my grandfather , but i am the first woman , and the first woman , and the first woman was my first woman .
my family .
i grew up , big families , my wish for my wish .
so my motto is global .
so i helped myself the  UNK  , the first school , and stood for the only girl in afghanistan , a country that was still dangerous for girls schools .
i &apos;m really excited to see my students to school to chance .
and i saw them parents and father like my father , regardless , regardless of even when the opposition is struggling .
like this guy . ahmed is not his name , and i couldn &apos;t ignore his eyes , but his father was a member of my students .
less than one month , and he was scratching on the streets of their village , and they actually actually got to killed a death bomb inside the  UNK  .
when he was talking about my home , my cell phone , a voice , if he drove the boy if he walked into my daughter , they would have .
and he said , &quot; if you want to kill me , but i &apos;m not going to destroy the my my my .
now , i &apos;ve found my success in afghanistan , and this is often the west side of the west , which is the most fundamental side of our citizens to cherish the value of our value and their daughter .
it &apos;s not the mother of our mothers .
in fact , they were the first person to persuade the status quo to persuade the future of the future .
under the taliban , the taliban have come to a small square , that is illegal .
but today , more than three million women are in afghanistan .
afghanistan is a different view from the united states .
i see that americans americans ,  UNK  , in vitro change .
i &apos;m afraid that all of those changes will not persist after the u.s. military .
but when i went back afghanistan afghanistan , when i saw the students in my school and and their parents , supporting them , encouraged , i hope to change the future and trend change .
for me , afghanistan is a state of hope , not to limit the world , and not to mention new schools .
like , they have big dreams .
thank you .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
a mobile phone can change your life , and your cellphone has delivered your cellphone for free .
with a mobile phone , you can record your tattoos control of human rights .
with a mobile phone , you can post a message on the board and post a protest and protesters in protest against the government .
and with a phone that you can record this song , it rang the fame and it became famous .
all that &apos;s completely remixable with your cell phone .
i &apos;m a child in 1984 , and i lived in berlin .
let &apos;s go back at that moment .
you can see here in thousands of thousands of people on the floor and stand up to change .
that &apos;s what happens when the rain , and imagine the people who have stood up and changed the change during a cell phone .
anyone in the audience ?
let &apos;s turn it up .
or your phone call your iphone , please raise your iphone ?
raise your hand . it &apos;s a phone , android . , wow .
many of them today , most of us have a mobile phone .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about myself and my personal phone , and how about it has changed my life .
i &apos;m going to talk about that .
there &apos;s about  UNK  information .
but information .
but why are those information here ?
the reason is due to the summer , by the european union commission , just a proposal .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
it &apos;s a new telecommunications company in europe , connectivity across the internet service across the internet .
who is somebody who ? who who somebody who someone sent someone dollars ?
who sent someone to receive mobile phones ?
and if you use cell phones , here &apos;s where the problem is .
all of this information is stored at least six months , for me , for two years , because you &apos;re wearing the internet service provider .
and across europe , people stood up and say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to . &quot;
they say , we don &apos;t want to ignore this information .
we want to have autonomy in our digital technology , and we don &apos;t want to assume that companies and the internet service provider all of our information information .
they were lawyers , lawyers and journalists , and all they said , &quot; we don &apos;t want to like that . &quot;
and you can see on here , like like a march involved in berlin , and they say , &quot; okay , &quot; no fear . &quot;
and some people say , it &apos;s like  UNK  2.0 .
UNK  is the police force force in germany .
i was wondering , had it actually work ?
can we record our entire information information ?
do we use our mobile phones ?
so i asked my house , using  UNK  , the service provider provider provider in denmark was at the time , and i asked them to ask , for them , please ask me to send my entire information to my entire information .
i asked them to ask them to send me a sheet , and i &apos;d like to ask , but what i was expected to get was a clear answer .
but then i said , i want to have this information , because they &apos;re saving my life .
and i decided to make a donation , because i wanted to get this information .
UNK   UNK  said , we &apos;re not going to give them information information .
and finally , i &apos;ve had a clients with them .
i &apos;m going to skip , and they will provide me information to give me requests .
because at the time , the soviet union decreed that the european union decreed is not in the southern constitution of the constitution .
so i got it in this  UNK  pot .
and on the cds , cd , i needed a record .
UNK  sethi : information .
so i first looked at it , and say , it was a big file .
but then i realized , this is my life .
this is life in my months months , i record this file .
then i wondered , what should we do with this ?
because i can see where i &apos;ve been talking about , where i &apos;m night to night .
but then i said , i want to go on this information .
i want to get to the public .
because i want to show people how people actually see real data .
so for the open source of information online , data , i do .
these are images of visual lives in the months of months that i recorded .
you can zoom into a catheter or you can , you can get back to the climate or backwards .
you can see my step .
you can even know how i was  UNK  by the train , and i was talking about the frequency between the location .
can all of this information .
i have a little scared .
but those information isn &apos;t just about me .
it &apos;s information about all of us .
first of all , it &apos;s just like me , called my wife and i call her wife , and i spoke with each other , we spoke to each other .
and then there &apos;s a couple of friends telling me , they call them .
then once you give you a call for you , and calling you give you a call , and you &apos;ll have a grid network .
but you can see how we communicate with each other , they call each other , when they sleep .
you can see all of that .
you can see the most important parts , like the leader of leadership .
if you have access to this information , you can see the status of the society community .
if you have access to information , you can control the entire society .
this is a drawing design for countries like china or iran .
so this is a study how to study all social media , you know , to someone who , who sent someone listening to email , all of that , if you could have access to access to this information .
and these information are stored in at least in europe in europe , for two years .
as i said before , let &apos;s imagine imagine if all the people on the street in the last fall in the fall of a cell in a bag .
and maybe it &apos;s probably going to know who has been involved in this march protests , and if you know the leader is that the leader behind it , it would never occurred .
the wall of the berlin wall would have won &apos;t exist .
and if there &apos;s a collapses of the fabric of the cold war in the cold war that would not exist .
and today , today ,  UNK  and companies want to record information about them , we get better , and online networking .
they want to be able to be under our lives , and so they want to record this information in time .
and autonomy is living in the digital technology , not .
what you should do is fighting for autonomy .
and you must struggled to think it every day .
then , when you go home , home your talk to your privacy , that your privacy is a value of value , and it &apos;s not outdated .
when you go home , let &apos;s tell you the owner of your company , by companies and  UNK  and keep listening information , despite the fact that although they don &apos;t necessarily have to do it .
and if you don &apos;t trust me , let &apos;s make personalized information that information about them .
so in the future , when you use your cellphone or to remind yourself that you have to remind you to fight for your own autonomy .
thank you .
photography is my passion for me when i &apos;m big enough to share a camera , but i want to talk to you about 15 pictures , and i &apos;m not from one of them .
there &apos;s no director art , i don &apos;t have the apple ; it &apos;s not taking care , but i &apos;m not interested in the light .
in fact , most of them are funded by every single item over time .
so the story began when i went to new york to participate in a lecture where i spoke to my wife and i took my image to my daughter &apos;s first birthday .
we happened to be in new york next year later , so we decided to take a picture .
you can see the story story .
when i &apos;m going to my third birthday to my daughter , my wife said , &quot; why don &apos;t you give him a new way to go to a new tour of the village and daughter , and then go on ? &quot;
and since we started clustering .
you know , there &apos;s a gesture of my camera is completely anonymous across the world .
no one who refuse , and lucky , who has no cure for us .
ask , we don &apos;t know how we &apos;re going to change our lives .
it became very closely related to us .
this was taken a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and i explained to try to explain what happened in the same way that a child could be five years old .
these pictures are not just a representation of a particular moment , or a particular particular journey .
they are ways for us to spend a week in our summer , thinking about our time , and we changed the way we change in the year , not just about physically , physically , physically , about everything .
because we had a photograph of photographs , but our view changes in my daughter , and i was placed in new oil , and i was looking at her life , looking at her eyes , and she looked at her interaction and interact with them .
and we have to focus on each other , and this is what we respect for years .
recently , in a trip , we &apos;re walking away , and suddenly we stopped the middle of the middle of the road , and it just goes to the color of the red store that it was very fond of that little girl .
she told her how she felt she was five years ago , standing at the right place .
she said it was looking for us to realize that when she saw it in the first saw the first nine years .
and now it &apos;s findings to see in new york , universities , because it &apos;s decided to go in new york .
and i realized : one of the most important things that we create memory .
so i &apos;d like to share the idea of an active role in trying to create memories .
i don &apos;t know how you do it , but this picture 15 pictures , i don &apos;t appear to do a lot of my family .
i &apos;m always smiling .
so i want to encourage you to invite everybody to be involved in the picture , and don &apos;t give me a question , and ask , ask , &quot; take your picture ? &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;d never forget my three words , who died in his life : &quot; hey , let &apos;s fight him fight fight against fight .
but never turn into a form of human beings . &quot;
in the last two decades from when the libya libya libya libya in libya was happening , and it was more courageous enough to push berserk by the  UNK  of the incidents incidents in tunisia and tunisia in egypt .
i was involved in libya in libya , and beyond the embodiment of the day of israel , and to start a fight against  UNK  .
and that &apos;s a great revolution .
the young men on the front row , the vast majority of the people dignity , dignity , social justice .
they &apos;ve been able to mirror a persona in the face of dictatorship with a dictatorship .
they showed a unity to the camp from  UNK  to east and west to southern south africa .
in the end , after six months , and months after the battle of war , came up with us to liberate our nation and liberate their country .
however ,  UNK   UNK  has a huge chunk of the heritage of corruption , corruption and  UNK  .
for four decades , the  UNK  of authoritarian regimes grew healthy and moral infrastructure .
cognition is cognitive and the challenges , but as many other women as many other women , in many ways of respect to society , and offers a comprehensive process .
nearly recently organized organized organized  UNK  in the time during the day and days after  UNK  collapsed --  UNK   UNK  .
after 33 years later , i libya libya libya , sebastian wernicke  UNK  passionately , i started to develop the skills the foundation , developing world .
there &apos;s a great group of women , i joined the founding group of women in the world of peace , women , leaders , from the different leaders , from different backgrounds , in the lobby , for empowerment , for empowerment and empowerment for empowerment and empowerment for women and respect to empower and equality , to fight for equality .
i was in incredibly difficult situations in the context of the election cycle , a kind of chaotic environment , which is dominated by a political view of racial opposition conspiracy and dominated by divergent .
i led to an idea of  UNK  women in the world of peace , to lobby the rule for a profitable rule , law enforcement agencies that could bring citizens to citizens to the citizens , but for citizens , destroying them to the constitution , and what is the most important rule , and the candidates is going to lay down the candidates of politics and the candidates , and the candidates , the candidates , and the candidates , and the list of candidate , and the candidate list of the list of the list of the
ultimately , our final idea has been successfully and successfully .
march women in the  UNK  parliament in the state of elections in the last 52 years .
however , just a little bit of elation , from the  UNK  of elections and innovation on the face of every day before we passed away from the news of violence .
one day we woke up in the morning of the  UNK  of  UNK  and  UNK  .
the other day we woke up in front of the united states feared and  UNK  attacks .
the other day we woke up in the invasion of government .
and every day , every day we went up to the state of the civil war and civil war against their own citizens , as opposed to torture as weapons in legal regulation .
our societies , by formal processes , becomes more potent and more prosperous and more control , our freedom , autonomy , dignity , social dignity , which we are in respect for the initial constitution .
UNK  ,  UNK  and became a symbol of icons .
i &apos;m not here to inspire my story to success in the story of creating a list of interviews and the elections .
so i came here to admit that all the country had gone wrong .
we had no rights rights .
and the elections have not counted peace , stability or  UNK  .
is a list of  UNK  and the  UNK  between the the and and the and and peace and reconciliation and and
no , no .
so what did it work ?
why societies we continue to society is a great society and dominated by the political and its universality of our greed and doubts , because both worlds ?
maybe it &apos;s not just about losing our women , but the value of our values , compassion and compassion .
our societies need a conversation with the national conversation and building more than the elections , but it just makes the disparity and polarization together .
our societies need to represent our fears from women .
we need to act like the  UNK  act of  UNK  .
we need to start acting like our compassion and compassion .
we need to develop a sexual partnership not only to protect ourselves , but instead of  UNK  , instead of instead of  UNK  , instead of  UNK  .
this is the essential idea that the country has been completely silent as as possible to breathe .
because it promises to the needle .
that &apos;s the real  UNK  .
and we needed to be survival .
in a verse of glass in the koran -- &quot; peace -- &quot; -- god is god himself , god himself . &quot;
and over the word , &quot;  UNK  &quot; i know about the traditions of abraham in the origin of arabic , &quot; which is &quot;  UNK  &quot; --  UNK  --  UNK  expression -- the expression of the sexual expression -- which is the birthplace of the sexes and the jewish tribe , the sexes , the birth of birth .
and the uterus is completely static , in this tight coupling , the  UNK  of life itself .
so we &apos;re taught &quot; our legitimacy .
so we &apos;re taught &quot; our ignorance . &quot;
he invites us to our faith .
thank you .
five years ago , i was too late a little bit like  UNK  .
the penn state university asked me , a teacher teaching teach communication a technology program .
i was scared .
actually .
but when i had open conversations , i experienced the experience that she experienced in the shipyard and then discovered the door to the world .
and that &apos;s what i feel when i feel when i talk to my students .
i believe the key to open the door to the world is communication .
we need to work very well with our scientists and engineers to change the world .
scientist and science is facing the greatest challenges of the biggest challenges , from the environment and energy , and more and more , if we don don &apos;t know , and don &apos;t understand , and it &apos;s not going to do it , and and , , , and , , and , , , , , and , , , , , and , , , , , and , , , , , , and , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , and , , , ,
but the effective conversations cannot happen if scientists and scientists and not engineer them .
ask scientists and engineers , or eight  UNK  with us .
i &apos;d like to share some of you to make a sexy science that we see the science of sexy science , sexy is sexy .
the first question is : what ?
why do science related to us .
don &apos;t just say that you study open your bone , bone or your bone center , bone marrow , it &apos;s going to look like the inside of us , because we need to know how to get sick and treat them .
when you describe science , if you &apos;re careful listening to the term .
from the term we understood the idea of his ideas .
i could say , &quot;  UNK  doc , &quot; and why not use time ? &quot;
so the idea is not easy to get them down .
instead , you like  UNK  , the better thing : the better things are simple , but simpler .
it &apos;s clear that you can talk about the science behind the idea .
so , for example , if you tell stories , that &apos;s fascinating to motivate us to motivate us .
and when you present , don &apos;t use the  UNK  .
have you ever wondered why i call them ? &quot;
when the horse was blown away ? and he was killing , and they kill him .
a slide like this , not just about it , but also depend on the part of the brain in the language of the brain , which allowed us to be fooled .
instead , this slide here shows the brown  UNK  actually understand better . it shows the distinctive structure of the bone so that it &apos;s really inspirational , empowering inspiration .
and the cat here is used to pick up and the audience reader can rely on them if they don &apos;t interact , and then we use this image to help us understand how much it makes sense .
i think this is just a few tools that help us open the door and the door of science and technology .
but i engineers myself to teach me to know how to  UNK  everything . i want to
so , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot;  UNK  finn , &quot; and &quot; the term &quot;  UNK  &quot; for &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is , &quot; you can explain explain , explain to the audience , but then you can appreciate the audience , &quot; and then ron , &quot; he loves to pay for the task that he &apos;s doing with the results , the results are going to work with .
and therefore , scientists and engineers , when you fill up the equations , you add up to the price , or say , to me .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m saying russell , and for a short time ago , i &apos;m a model .
in fact , 10 years .
and i felt felt less unfair in this room because i &apos;m not supposed to wear this thing .
luckily luckily i brought a different suit .
this is the first time you see on the stage ted stage , so i think you &apos;re delighted to see this .
if i feel a woman scared when i &apos;m scared , when you &apos;re not told me , right now , but i &apos;m just going to go through .
i realize that i &apos;m very fortunate fortunate to change what you think about 10 .
not everybody has an opportunity to do this .
sometimes the shoes is less likely to be comfortable uncomfortable , but i &apos;m not going to .
the worst part is in  UNK  hands , because how do you smile , so what do you when it comes in .
it &apos;s done .
why do i do that ?
it &apos;s weird .
actually , hopefully it &apos;s not weird .
the image is huge , but it &apos;s also fake .
i &apos;ve just completely changed what i think about six seconds .
and in this photograph , i actually haven &apos;t have left .
i felt very uncomfortable at this moment , and photography  UNK  photography had to put my feet back and forth his hands .
and of course , the surgery , or ptsd ii , i have a couple of days ago to have , very very , very very , very , very very , very , very , very , very , very , , to , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so today , i &apos;m not afraid i &apos;m afraid .
and i stood on this stage because i &apos;m a model .
i stand on this stage because i am beautiful , a white woman , and in our prototype , we call it a girl .
and i will answer questions that people are always asking me , but with honesty .
the first question is , how did i become a model ?
and i &apos;m always saying , &quot; oh , i found , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
in fact , i became a model because i was awarded the genetic profiles , and i was a member of my identity , inherit , and maybe you were wondering about what they were .
in the past decades , we have definition definition of beauty , and depression and depression and we are consistent with our biological lives , but also the height of the illumination , and the  UNK  and white divisions and  UNK  and white divisions and white .
this is the legacy of a legacy of furniture , and it &apos;s a legacy where i made a small point in it .
i know there &apos;s a couple of people who are watching this skeptic , and some groups have a beautiful dress , like  UNK  .
i want to praise the praise of your audience .
but unfortunately , i have to tell you in 2007 , a ph.d. student in new york was a lot of episodes , and in fact , in a  UNK  model of  UNK  , there &apos;s less than 90 percent , not less than four percent of whites .
the next question that people all have me asking me : is that i can become my big brother ? &quot;
and the first answer my answer is : &quot; you know , not just &quot; vote . &quot;
but the next answer that i actually want to talk to girls is : &quot; why ? &quot;
you know ? i can become anyone .
you can become the president of the united states , or the inventor of the internet , or a  UNK  , a great  UNK  , the great  UNK  .
if , after a list of interesting , i &apos;m still say , &quot; no , no , no , cameron , i want to become a model , i &apos;m going to
because it &apos;s not only power power , or maybe the editor of the editor of the american museum in the u.s.
she says she wanted to be as if i grew up as if i &apos;d like to say when i &apos;d like to say when you got a little bit when i was growing up .
it &apos;s the control of control , and it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a career path .
i &apos;m going to show you -- for 10 years of experience , i &apos;ve been working with it , because it didn &apos;t work with cardiac surgeon , just a short time .
if the photographer was standing here in the light , the same as a interface interface , and as the clients says : &quot; when she came to me , &quot; he wanted to go to the tank , &quot; and he walked up to walk up to this tank , and this was a foot in front of the tank , and after three weeks later , and after three weeks later , you just get to the end of the tank , and then , just by the end of the talk , and you &apos;re going
like this .
hopefully it &apos;s less less than the middle in between the middle .
i don &apos;t know what happens inside .
in fact , when you learn to learn , you write , and write and write a couple of things that you can &apos;t talk to each other anymore , because if you want to talk to the united states of the american mind : &quot;
the next question that people ask me : i &apos;m asking all of you ?
right here , it &apos;s almost all eight images , but it &apos;s only one element of what &apos;s going on .
this is one of my favorite images that i &apos;ve ever been photographed , and it &apos;s the first time that i took my photographs , and i was even at that time .
i know that we &apos;re going into a personal moment when i &apos;m a boy .
this is my view , and photographed of three months ago .
this is me in one day .
my friend &apos;s going to go .
this is my evening at a day before i was taking pictures of  UNK  .
this is my team sport in the magazine .
and this is now .
i hope you &apos;re going to see -- photos on the pictures of my image .
these are images that are used , and it &apos;s been used by a group of professionals , professionals , professionals , professionals , professionals , professionals , professionals and professionals , and the musicians and builders , and they crafted all of their customers , and they &apos;re creating , and they &apos;re makers .
the next question i was asked , asked , &quot; what is you free for free ? &quot;
i have a lot of shoes shoes in  UNK  heels i &apos;ve never been dived , but this is the exception , but it &apos;s something that i received from what i have in life , except for life , and that &apos;s what we want .
i grew up in cambridge , and it took me to go to the store , and i used to take away with them , and they gave me a virtual medium .
when i was a teenager , i was sitting a car dealer , and she was driving a very scary man , and she saw the red line , she grabs us , and we got to stop , and all of what i did , and saying , &quot; i &apos;m saying , &quot; i &apos;m saying , &quot; you &apos;re told you , &quot; and we said , &quot; hey , you can tell you . &quot;
i got a mail , but it was into my side , and not because i &apos;m not somebody who was willing to have people who were willing to spend on a lot of money for them .
i lived in new york , and last year , in 140 140  UNK  and  UNK  , 86 percent known as adults , medieval schools .
in new york , there are thousands of black ugandan and others , so , they don &apos;t have to be me ? &quot;
i &apos;m &quot; am going to get arrested ? &quot;
when i &apos;m preparing for this talk , i discovered that , by percent of these girls have 13 years old in the united states who didn &apos;t like the age of my body , and they came to 78 percent .
the final question that people ask me is : &quot; how do you feel the color ? &quot;
i think that they want to listen to &quot; if you wait a little bit , and your hair is more  UNK  , and you &apos;ll be happy . &quot;
and when we left behind the wheel , we took the answer to the kind of thing .
&quot; it was great to travel , and work with creative people , talent . &quot;
and that &apos;s true , that &apos;s just one thing , because that &apos;s what we &apos;ve never been before before , before myself , i &apos;ve never seen before .
i &apos;m nervous because i have to think about image every day .
and you have yourself wonder yourself , &quot; if you &apos;re more  UNK  and more kindly , so i &apos;m happier . &quot;
you just need a group of people , because they have their best legs ,  UNK  and the most beautiful most vivid , and they can be the most proud of the the planet
when i wrote this speech , i felt very hard to find a balance , because , i feel like i was uncomfortable uncomfortable when i came here to talk to me , &quot; i &apos;m all sure i &apos;m going to die , because i &apos;m really fortunate enough to die , and i &apos;m really sure enough , and i &apos;m really sure enough , and i &apos;m not really sure enough , and i &apos;m not really sure enough to be happy . &quot;
but mostly is tough , it &apos;s a legacy of identity and the problem of the problem i am in one of the biggest people .
but i &apos;m also happy to be honored to be honored up here , and i think it &apos;s been fortunate enough to get me before , 10 or 20 or 30 years ago , and i &apos;ve been working with a career company in my career , because i can tell you stories because i &apos;m going to tell you about .
if there &apos;s something that goes in this conversation , i hope it &apos;s all of us feel uncomfortable to feel more powerful .
thank you .
there &apos;s a lot of ways of people around us who can help improve our lives .
we don &apos;t get around the people around the table , so there &apos;s a lot of times that we have never been able to know , even though we shared public space .
so a few years ago , i &apos;m trying to share a lot more to share with my public space in public space , using simple tools , like a paper , and german .
and these projects came from the question , asked me , like my neighbor , how much i would pay for the apartment ?
how do we want our jobs and we want more to do things than wood is at the same time ?
how do we share more of our memories of our buildings that are abandoned , and we understand better understand our landscape ?
and how do we share a lot more hope of our hope for the store and the rest of our communities that reflect our dream and our dreams today ?
now , i lived in new orleans , and i was in love , new orleans , new orleans .
my mind is always being constrained by the trees that grew up , the  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  hundreds of years , and i have expected to believe in the city .
i felt like everyone was  UNK  , new orleans .
the city has some of the most beautiful architecture on the world , but it also has the largest number of the best value in the united states .
i live close to this house , and i think , how can i become a better place for my neighborhood , and i think think about something i can change my life forever .
in 2009 , i lost a very passionate loved ones .
her name is changing , and she was a mother to me , and my death of death is a surprise and  UNK  and uncertainty .
and i thought about death , and this makes me feel a sense of what i have had , and i &apos;ve given a clarity of what i mean for life now .
but i struggled to keep the perspective in my daily lives .
i felt it was easy for years to get through the day , and it forgot to really make sense .
so with the help of people and old , and i moved to an abandoned building into a giant collection and a big deal with it , and you fill them into a yo-yo -- in my life : &quot; i want to dedicate my life , i want to ruin my life .
i don &apos;t know what to expect from this trial , but on the day after the day , it was completely  UNK  , and it kept on .
and i want to share a few things about people on the wall .
&quot; before i die , i want to try to try . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to be  UNK  on the holidays . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to sing millions of people . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to plant a tree . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to live outside . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to get sick again . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to become a  UNK  . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to be totally .
so space was dominated by a space that was formed , and the hope and dreams of my dreams , and i slipped up , and tears and tears , and in tears , and in tears , and i was crying in the rest of the time .
it &apos;s about realization that you don &apos;t just have one .
it &apos;s about understanding the people around us and  UNK  .
it &apos;s about creating space to reflect and  UNK  , and what that is truly what we regret when we change adults and change .
i &apos;m doing this project last year , and started getting hundreds of letters from the people who want to make a wall of their community , so their colleagues so , and so i &apos;m doing a tool , and now i &apos;m doing a tool , and now , as a  UNK  tool , which is what we &apos;ve been doing , and the  UNK  countries , in the world , australia .
together , we just had public spaces that we have access to the power of if we could give her a chance to be shared voice and shared shared a shared narrative , and to share another one more .
two most important thing we have is time and time with other people .
in a rise of our age , this is more important than to figure out how to keep the and maintain and short life and short .
what death is something that we normally don &apos;t encourage to aim or even to think about it , but i &apos;m going to give you that the death is that death is one of the most powerful things that you can do .
think about dying of life lives .
but our shared shared our shared narrative can be reflected back to reflect on what we &apos;re as individuals , as a community , and with a lot of ways to hope , and hope to hope and shared fear and hope to tell us stories , but we &apos;re not able to tell ourselves around them .
thank you .
thank you .
yes , i do math math and app and this is an incredible problem for anybody , which is what we ought to manage .
nobody knows what we do .
so today i &apos;m going to try to explain to you .
well , dance is one of the things that people normally do .
we cherish dancers for the dance and dance  UNK  you &apos;re going to see .
buy buys a special level of technical discipline and technical engineering levels that can be relevant to this relevant genetics .
and unfortunately , neurologic diseases like parkinson &apos;s reduced to progressively denser , as if it occurred to me ,  UNK   UNK  , who was a  UNK  artist .
for the last years have progress .
however ,  UNK  million people worldwide , and they have to live in the , condition , the , , , , , , , , symptoms , , , , , , , , , , need , to , to we need to identify
we need to change the way , objective , and the only way we think we know how we treat it is , when we have a french mechanism , we can figure out how to answer .
but it turns out that they &apos;re with parkinson &apos;s disease and other neurologic disorders , they don &apos;t have cassava , so they don &apos;t have a simple test , but you can do the best , and the best thing we can have standardized tests .
you need to go to hospitals to do that . it &apos;s very expensive , it means that clinical trials clinical trials , it &apos;s never been done .
but if if patients can do this tests in the house ?
it &apos;s going to really go a place to go to the clinic , and if you &apos;re able to do a clinical trial , how do you do it ?
it &apos;s time for the time .
it &apos;s only about 300 dollars , 300 cells in the clinic .
so what i want to suggest is you coping with a traditional fee , that we can achieve this , because as you can see , at least one day , we are masters of these masters .
here we have a movie of video games .
this paper was healthy and someone who was saying , and we can watch as the dancer , and diana nyad , because we had to use all the time agencies to create new language , and we all have the genetic code for us .
it &apos;s like a trained need to be trained .
i mean , how long it takes to take a child .
from sound , we &apos;re actually able to track the position of vocal nerves , when the only are affected by your parkinson &apos;s disease , by the way , your voice has fooled .
so below the graph , you can see an example of an  UNK  forest of  UNK  .
we all see symptoms .
we see  UNK  , and our fragile .
the voice gets louder and much more hours later , and that is one of the symptoms .
but the sound can really can be really hard to detect , in some cases , with any electronic sensors , and software analysis to analyze the most accurate machine methods , which is the most accurate way that we can quantify ourselves in exactly the right amount of confidence in the same way that represent the same transmission in the same amount of nutrients in the same way .
so how does this experiment based on the same as compared to the professional ?
the nervous experiment has no  UNK  . they have infrastructure .
you don &apos;t need to redesign a whole new system to run this hospital .
and both of them .
that means it can be done .
fast pace , it takes about 30 miles .
the cost tower , and we all know what happens .
what happens is something that &apos;s cheap , it will be distributed .
so this is a great goal of what i think we can do now .
we can do the hard problem for logistics .
needless to go to clinic .
we can do this with a high frequency with high resolution data to get data .
we can do advertising and  UNK  with low cost to clinical trials clinical trials , to scale on a scale basis for the first time .
we have an opportunity to start looking at the beginnings of  UNK  .
so to do the first step towards the end of this , we &apos;re going to have to start aging .
with  UNK  and  UNK  , we came up with a voice with a very large number of samples across the global data to collect data and analytics .
we have a local residents of access to access to access to a billion people on a planet .
any healthier or parkinson &apos;s disease , i can call  UNK  , and leave my message , and a few seconds , and i &apos;m really happy , i &apos;m really happy to say , we &apos;ve funded the next 10 percent .
thank you .
tom wujec : max , how to take all of your blood ?
what are you going to conclusion from these samples ?
max weber : well .
you see , some people could not do that . they couldn &apos;t call me .
but we &apos;re going to pick up vast amounts of data collection from all these different directions , and the results are in different directions , because we &apos;re looking at least consider the element of finding , and this is actually finding the findings of this disease .
so what &apos;s right now ? is 86 percent ?
it &apos;s newer .
in fact , my student pranav  UNK  , i have to prove him , because he has some amazing thing , he has shown that this proved that can be done through mobile mobile phone , so that allows the mobile phone , that allows the project to be able to do this .
nine .
so , that means that people will invite people to take mobile phone calls from their mobile phones and checking them , and you can have parkinson &apos;s disease , parkinson &apos;s disease , they can improve their own voice , and then they can improve their doctors , and then they can examine their behavior .
exact .
thank you very much .
thank you .
i live in the middle of the year .
this is a central bank : wine , wine , fast food .
so the zoning city council together and they &apos;re going to see what it &apos;s called in terms of meaning .
this is in los angeles .
UNK  , fast food , fast food .
it &apos;s almost like millions of americans , i live in a  UNK  desert city in los angeles , sitting in the fast food , fast food and fast food .
what &apos;s interesting is about fast food is killing killing people dying en masse .
in  UNK  , los angeles are dying .
so , for example , the rate of growth in the middle of the five times larger times , for example , beverly , beverly and about 16 miles .
i  UNK  when i saw this had to happen .
and i wonder , how do you feel healthy food for every time when your eye is going to see the bad thing that you know ?
i saw the wheelchairs wheelchair .
i saw the cultivation centers as a starbucks .
and i realize that that has to stop .
i realized that the problem is solution .
food is the problem and food is food .
and i was also overwhelmed with all of 45 minutes , just to buy a single dose of  UNK  drugs .
what i did was a food in front of the house .
it &apos;s on a long way that we call it  UNK  .
it &apos;s more  UNK  .
the problem is the land , it belongs to belong .
but you have to hold it .
so i thought , &quot; great . i can do it , because it &apos;s my responsibility for me to hold it . &quot;
and this is how i stayed in the land of land .
so with my crew , my green , green  UNK  , we started commuting and plant in the forest : food plants , you know , nine plants .
we &apos;re a group of people who share the with  UNK  , but from many different lives from each other lives , from every city in cities , and they &apos;re willing to , and everything we do .
and it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s beautiful .
then she  UNK  .
the city i met , and i was a given to a  UNK  , forced to break to a break .
and i said , &quot; okay ? &quot;
one of the guards had planted planted trees on the board that didn &apos;t care about ?
and i said , &quot;
since this time , i didn &apos;t .
a.  UNK  : the texts was challenged , steve  UNK  wrote a song about it , and with your head .
we had a  UNK  .
the board commissioner is even calling me , and they say that they like to do what we &apos;re doing .
i mean , is why ?
l.d.  UNK  : the u.s. accounted for the city of the city .
they owned a  UNK  square .
the equivalent for 20 20 park , the central park .
it &apos;s enough to plant  UNK  million .
how can they agree ?
in a plant that gives you 10,000 seed .
when the cost of the cost is going to cost about 75 dollars per product .
that &apos;s my belief , when i tell people , from people or food .
in our food products from the money .
i have a legacy of  UNK  .
i grew up there .
and i refuse to do a part of what reality is made , which is created by some other people and me .
i am an artist .
UNK  is my artwork . in my artwork .
just like a cartoonist , about the wall of the wall , about me , for 62 ,  UNK  .
i use a piece of furniture , put in a canvas like a couple of trees and trees and plant , and i &apos;m concerned about it .
you &apos;re going to with all the unexpected things that if you make them a little seaweed .
you can &apos;t imagine how great art and how they affect how many people .
so what happened ?
i witnessed my own garden to become a powerful tool , education for transformation .
in order to change the community , you have to change your components .
we are .
you &apos;re surprised when you see how young babies are affected .
gardens is the most successful business and the challenges that you can do , particularly in city .
and , you know , the thing is .
i remember one day , there was a mother and my daughter , and that was a girl : 30 and 10 years later , and in my 30s in my garden .
i thought , oh my god , i feel bad because they were there . and i told them that , they said , you don &apos;t need to do that .
this  UNK  in the line line is the reason for it .
i felt embarrassed when i saw the people who came close to me and still wait and wait , and the reason why i would add this reason why i was working on .
i answer , &quot; of course , i don &apos;t fear .
so they all in the street .
the whole idea is .
i want them to take them , but then they want to get my health . &quot;
there was another day when i was in budapest in downtown los angeles .
there &apos;s a man , they helped me to get a truck from trucks .
the air is very happy , and they share stories stories about how powerful they affect and they &apos;ve been used in their mothers with their mothers , with their mothers , and before they &apos;ve seen this idea that they &apos;ve changed the idea that they &apos;ve changed .
so the blue line has continued to grow in 20 pieces .
we had about 50 people to participate , and i was all .
if kids in the  UNK  , they will double helix .
if they &apos;re tomato , they &apos;re tomato .
but no one can show them them , if they don &apos;t see the impact of the mind and mind , they will find anything in front of us .
i see young people who wanted to work , but they were stuck in front of me , and i saw the children who came to see the color of color , and they just pick up their path , which i was not going to hurt .
with glaciers , i see a chance that we can give four children &apos;s communities , and they have a sustainable life .
and when we do that , who knows ?
maybe we &apos;re going to be released from george washington george  UNK  .
but if we don &apos;t change the ingredient , we will never do that .
this is one of my projects . this is what i want to do .
i want one of the pieces of pieces in the audience .
i want to go to public schools -- it &apos;s going to turn them into sea and beneficial health .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
i &apos;m not talking about things , free free ; it &apos;s not sustainable .
what &apos;s interesting about sustainability , is that you have to maintain it .
i &apos;m talking about taking care of people , and pull out of the  UNK  out of the street , and they know the joy of pride , joy and pleasure and joy in honor of honor , for for a shopping mall .
what i want to do here is , we &apos;re going to make it sexy .
i want all to become a rebel  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
we &apos;re going to change the concept of concept .
if you &apos;re not  UNK  , you &apos;re not  UNK  .
do it  UNK  with your  UNK  ?
and let &apos;s throw it into a weapon .
basically , if you want to meet you , you know , if you want to meet you , don &apos;t want to call me if you want to  UNK  in the chair and i talk about where you talk about this talk where you talk about it .
if you want to meet , let &apos;s go along with your pen and you puke in a couple of things .
hi . thank you .
thank you .
this is where i live .
behind me my father was left my father , and the father , the national park .
the national park devoid of  UNK  in the region area , which means that wildlife  UNK  out of the park .
and so penguins animals eat like after tiger , and this is what leopard seals do .
they kill our livestock .
this is one of my father was killed in the morning , and when i woke up in the morning , i saw it was dead , and i felt very sad , because it was the only thing that we had left .
my community , , , believed that we from meditation in love with other animals and all of our lands to keep them , because why is why we value them value .
so i grew up with the lion  UNK  .
the actors who protect our communities and we are very concerned about this issue .
so they kill lions .
this was a lion behind the lion was killed in nairobi .
and i think this is why the national park in national park are very few .
the youngest son from six to nine years old , in my community , is responsible for my leg and my father , and i have to do the same thing .
so i had to figure out how to fix this problem .
the first idea that i had was used , fire because i think of lions .
but then i realized that i didn &apos;t actually work , because it &apos;s even further down the track of seeing the bell .
but i don &apos;t quit .
and the second idea of my artwork is use .
i tried to  UNK  the leopard seals .
these are very smart .
they are the first day , and i saw them , and then they turned them back to the day , and second , and they said , and it &apos;s not this thing , it &apos;s just going to it .
and then they hop freight and kill .
so one night , i held a tree ring around the doorbell , that night , and she doesn &apos;t exist .
i discovered that lion lions .
so i have a idea .
since i remember , i used to work in my office , and even my grandfather had passed the radio every single day , and that night , i was killed , but i learned a lot about what i had learned about .
so i took a battery -- a car drove a car . it &apos;s a little device that was found in a car that was built in the car that was built in the car , and he helped to figure out what they &apos;d like to take off .
and i have a switch to switch gears and open .
and that &apos;s a little light bulb .
and i set up everything .
as you can see , the batteries battery use the battery to battery , battery , battery , battery and energy -- the battery that battery you call it .
and the box has made for  UNK  .
as you can see , it &apos;s lighting the light bulbs , because it &apos;s the lion lion .
and that &apos;s the way the light that shine light on the light when they arrive at night .
they have turned upside down to the lion , and they thought they thought i &apos;d been around the bell , but actually i &apos;m actually lying on my bed .
thank you .
i installed it up in my house two years ago , since we don &apos;t have any trouble with lions with lions .
family members about this idea .
one of them is this .
she has many cattle eaten , and she asked me if i could help her  UNK  .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
so i installed collusion cameras , you can see here in the next two , and these are the light bulb .
so this came to me , i helped them to seven children in their own backyard , and they worked .
now my idea was used in kenya with other animals like the hyena , and it was also threatened to protect them from the farm to the farm .
this particular invention , i &apos;ve been blessed to get a good school in schools in kenya , in the international schools , and i &apos;m really excited about this .
my school school is now starting to help and raise raise .
i even pasted my friends in community community , and we installed them to the  UNK  families that they have access to me and teach them to put them to them .
a year ago , i just had a boy in the cage of my father , and my father , i saw seen flying airplanes , flying airplanes , and i flew him to say , that one day i would sit in it .
and i &apos;m here today .
i had an opportunity to go to the airplane with the first time .
the biggest dream of mine is becoming an aircraft and pilot on top of them .
i used to hate the lion , but now i &apos;m saving my father and my father , and we can live with lions without any conflicts .
UNK  .
i don &apos;t know that it &apos;s interesting when i hear stories .
so i &apos;ve got a scholarship .
you &apos;re doing the invention of other things .
what &apos;s the next invention in your list list ?
the invention of my invention is , i want to do a wire fence .
you know that the fences has been invented , but you want to do your own .
and i tried , right , and i have you in africa had been stopped with electric charges .
richard  UNK  , great .
we &apos;re going to have the kids in your town .
thank you very much . thank you .
what i did , and what i do about -- my life -- had been prepared to seven in seven years in africa .
since 1962 in 1977 -- i &apos;m not young in the early &apos; 80s -- i -- i &apos;ve been working on zambia in kenya , in kenya ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , in colombia , in collaboration , with the projects in somalia , with partnerships in collaboration with partnerships with african countries .
i &apos;ve been working on ngos to italy and what we &apos;ve done in africa has failed to fail .
i was very  UNK  .
all the 21st of life , i think , people are good , and we are working in africa africa .
but since we can kill the death that we we don &apos;t .
the first project , what was inspired by the first book of my book , &quot;  UNK   UNK  , &quot; from  UNK  , which is one of the projects in which i decided to teach people in food .
so we looked at the southern seed cathedral in southern  UNK  bay up to the  UNK  , and we teach people in the italian and italian and italian .
of course , these poor people are interested in this task , so we paid them and they go to work .
we actually grew up with indigenous people , in the soil like this savannah .
but instead of asking why they don &apos;t look anything like us , we simply say , &quot; thank you . thank you . &quot;
&quot; just blow yourself out of prison rescue .
and of course , everything in africa is good .
we &apos;ve got a lot of tomato sauce . in italy , it &apos;s too much bandwidth in this country .
it was incredible , and we spoke to people in zambia , and we were looking at people in india .
when the landscapes of the land , soil , nine and red , just passed through them , about 200 yards away .
we told people , &quot; oh god , ooh ! &quot;
and people said , &quot; well , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t look something here . &quot;
&quot; why can people tell us before us before ? &quot;
i thought , you know , it &apos;s worth in africa , but when i look at what you americans , doing what you &apos;re doing , but what you &apos;re doing in french , doing what you &apos;re doing , and after seeing what they &apos;re doing .
because , you can see , we &apos;ve eaten also meals eaten dogs .
you should look at all this crap -- so you should look at all the crap that we &apos;ve been blessed with african .
you want to read the book , or write &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK   UNK  genug ,  UNK  , world-class  UNK  .
the book was published in 2009 .
we have the national income countries , brought up to the continent of africa .
i &apos;m not going to tell you the amount of damage .
take a book reading her book .
reading it from a woman woman , but what we did .
but the western societies like us is the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the constitution , and we are only  UNK  in the way compared to other people : or , or  UNK  , or or  UNK  .
two words from medieval languages , &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which means &quot; dad . &quot;
but it &apos;s different .
and i &apos;m treat with any other religious culture from what i am . &quot; i love them . &quot;
my sponsor , i &apos;m hungry with each other from all different cultures .
that &apos;s why the white difference in africa is called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i was tied off in front of the book when i read the little book , &quot; snowy , beautiful ,  UNK  , , most of all , in the economy , if they don &apos;t , help or help .
this is the first principles of aid .
the first principle of respect is respect .
this morning , this organization has put a  UNK  tree , and say , &quot; can we take a picture of a city without a  UNK  ? &quot;
when i was 27 years old , i decided to focus with people and and i was creating a system called  UNK   UNK  , where you &apos;re not going to have anything you never wanted , who never allowed me to go to a  UNK  , who has become a  UNK  who wanted to become a  UNK  for survival .
so what you do -- you &apos;re left corner .
never come to a community with the idea .
we don &apos;t work from the office .
we meet at the pub .
we had no infrastructure infrastructure .
and what we do is we &apos;re going to each other .
the most important point is .
you can somebody someone like a idea .
if that didn &apos;t want to do , then , how do you do ?
the aspiration of the woman has for aim is the most important thing .
the  UNK  of male survival of personal aim is the most important thing .
and we helped them to look for the insight , because nobody wanted to be successful .
the idea has god idea , understanding the idea .
so a lot of years ago , i have this idea : why don we don &apos;t just one another , instead of a community , and to tell people what they &apos;re doing , what do we listen to them , but not just for a meeting meeting , but not just for a meeting meeting ?
let me tell you a secret .
there &apos;s still one in the meetings .
entrepreneurs have never come to mind , and they don &apos;t tell you , in the community , what they want to do with their money , what they find .
so this takes a plan .
the most wise citizens in  UNK  , never known them because they didn &apos;t go to public meetings .
what we did was working a team -- and to do that , you have to create a social structure that doesn &apos;t exist .
you have to create a new .
a new nigerian sport , a nigerian family , a family business , for business , with your friends in your home , in your kitchen , in your kitchen , in your kitchen , and help you find a way of finding the source of resources to find a source .
i started grappling as a  UNK  experiment .
i &apos;m in academic , at the time of the time , trying to get rid of of  UNK  and how to you .
so what i did in the first year was in  UNK   UNK  , just over three days and three days , and in my three days , i had a very nice day , i had a very nice piece of furniture , and in the garage , a garage , a garage , and he helped me to sell a restaurant for a restaurant , and he sits in a restaurant and a restaurant , and for a restaurant , and he got into a restaurant , and where do you work ?
and i helped these guys know how to cook each other , and you &apos;ve got these  UNK  tuna for you to do it with a  UNK  factory , 60 bucks , and we &apos;ve found a way to encourage them to hire the price for japanese tea , and for $ 40,000 cents , and the price of a farmer , who said , &quot; hey , doc , help john people ? &quot;
in one year , i have 27 partner and my partner government , &quot; how do you do it ?
what do you do -- and i say , &quot; i &apos;ve done a very hard job .
i listened to my mouth and listened to them . &quot;
so -- -- so the government said to me , &quot; keep doing it . &quot;
we did that in 300 communities around the world .
we helped profit 40,000 business .
there is a new generation epsilon of people who are increasingly isolated .
peter  UNK  : one of the greatest sayings in the history of finance , when years ago .
peter  UNK  was a professor of professor , when he was working with business , and this was the way that &apos;s peter  UNK  : &quot; real interaction with a society and a business business .
planning is the kiss of death .
so now , you &apos;re looking at in new jersey , that you don &apos;t know who &apos;s most baffling in the nicer ?
you have to learn how to those people to you .
you have to go to the security guard , privacy , you &apos;ve got to really excited , because they &apos;re helping them , and i &apos;m going to follow the crowd .
with 10,000 communities , we could have 200 200 clients .
can you imagine a broader more committee , with intelligence and intelligence ?
this is a lot of  UNK  .
the people , the human aspirations .
so what i &apos;m talking about is business is a business .
we are at the final phase of the industrial revolution -- with the birthplace of r &amp; amp ; d , and , of course , we don &apos;t have robust systems .
the engine in the medina is not sustainable .
so let &apos;s take advantage of the  UNK  .
what we have to look at is that we nurture to nurture , nurture , education , and move to seven billion people .
there &apos;s not technology .
what &apos;s going to reinvent technology ?
the government ?
that will be  UNK  , and they &apos;re doing it right now right now .
there &apos;s a very funny story that i &apos;m reading in a magazine called  UNK  years ago .
there was a group of experts in a new discussion about the future of new york city .
and in  UNK  , the qalandar group came together , and over the course of what happened in new york city in the next 100 years , and in conclusion , following conclusion : after the city : new york city would not exist in the next 100 years .
why ? because they look at the curve in the curve and say , if the world &apos;s population growth , in order to move a population of new york city , they will need to be six million people , and from the horse , and then there are six million words that are not going to have to be cut down .
they will be  UNK  in the horse .
so in  UNK  , they saw this technology of  UNK  technology in the city of life in new york city .
so what has happened ? in 40 years ago , in the united states , in the u.s. , there was a company in the car company .
the idea of a technology that has completely changed across the globe , and there are very small factories in this  UNK  situation .
UNK  .
however , there is a secret to work with business .
first of all , you have to go online for them .
there &apos;s not going to go to to talk to you .
then you have to bring them an absolute service provider , and they are .
and then you have to tell them about them .
the most small company , biggest biggest companies , has to be able to do wonderful three things : the product that you want to want you to have , you have to have a you have , you have to have a have you with , and you have you have to have a you have to have you have to have the funds .
think of this ?
we &apos;ve never met a personal person in the world , who &apos;ve been able to do , , and , and and and and and and .
it didn &apos;t exist .
this character has never been born .
we did a study , and we looked at 100 percent of our companies in the world , carnegie mellon , at ford , all of google .
there &apos;s one thing that all the success companies in the world , there is a one : just one company : begin with a user .
we teach our businesses about the age of 16 in 16 years , we started with the first two children in the first two years of richard weber , richard weber , richard and 16 years old in the ages of 16 years old , which is 16 years old in the age of 16 years old , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK  , richard  UNK
it never occurred from me , &quot; and we &apos;ve got 32 times .
he didn &apos;t start alone .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
so we can create a community where people are able to support based on the scale of a small scale of small enterprises in the , , the , , and , , you and you and you of people you of you of you that you of for whom who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who you asking you ?
can you do what ? do you do ?
okay , can you zap it ? you can handle money ?
&quot; oh , no , i can &apos;t do it . &quot; i want you to want to find somebody else ? &quot;
we activate those communities .
we have these volunteers volunteers from  UNK   UNK  help them to search for resources and resources we discovered that that is the intelligent intelligence of what people like is that the challenge of our economies , and so the challenge of our economies and the economic experience of the economy in the economy , the way of thinking about the energy of the imagination .
thank you .
in march for three months , 2011 , i woke myself in the new york city .
we are creatures , creatures , creatures .
eating in the dark room , and they &apos;re sun sunlight .
we &apos;ve been more responsible for the skin , the better beauty is beautiful , and it can &apos;t be useful , and it has always been criticized for us , but the press in our newspapers , but we also have a great deal with the incredible experience of us with our experience and the experience of knowledge .
in november 15th , 2011 , watching the world in the world , i see the tragic events occurred in japan .
then i held a volunteer volunteer all over the  UNK  , a couple of days later .
i &apos;m also hundreds of volunteers volunteers who couldn &apos;t just sit at home , and so i decided to join them with three weeks .
on april 15th , i found tim  UNK  .
it &apos;s a small village in  UNK  , with a 50,000 of 50,000 people , one of the first places that cross the line .
the depth is reported to notice less than 24 kilometers , and over three kilometers away .
so imagine the town .
we pulls samples from  UNK  channels .
the school bus , hygiene , ready for innovation and  UNK  .
we  UNK  tons of  UNK  , and from the factory to factory .
we  UNK  , but who are fun .
in many weeks , volunteers volunteers and search for a second .
they &apos;re looking for images and images and and camera and  UNK  .
all of that .
they collected and  UNK  them to stay in places places around them .
it &apos;s not that time when i realize that every single one of these images is a personal portion of these individuals .
when the gunfire , alive , keep keeping their lives , keep the father , everything all left behind everything left behind .
on the weekend on the bus , i went to a  UNK  downtown .
i helped  UNK   UNK  , confidence ,  UNK  giant .
and here &apos;s the place where the invasion of  UNK  .
this is a place where people  UNK  them , and that day i &apos;m hoping for them , because they trust me to allow them to give them a book .
and it &apos;s moved to me .
when i look over the photo , there &apos;s some more than a hundred years ago , there are still some of the  UNK  in the rooms , i thought , oh , i think , by the way , and i can fix the milk and i could ruin my body .
so i &apos;m going to access access to facebook and ask a couple of people , and i turned to the morning , and i got a lot of positive feedback , i started to know .
we started the main milk .
this is the first eight .
it &apos;s not very sick , but it has been to the to the the the the the the the the the the the ,  UNK  the exactly right
if no boy , girl in the photo will not remain humorous anymore , and that &apos;s certainly worse .
over time , a lot of images , images delivered , and , you need to edit out of the milk , and then , again , i &apos;ve paused on facebook , and on facebook , and i &apos;ve paused on the day , and in the &apos; 80s , i wanted to help 80 other people in the u.s.
in two weeks , i &apos;ve had 150 people to participate .
in july , we came up with the town of the nearby village , far beyond the corner of the town .
every single week , we put a device scan of our library in the library that had been done before , to get people to reclaim their own photos .
older women sometimes haven &apos;t seen a scanner , but after 10 minutes , looking at his photograph , his eyes , to give us a scan , to put a server on a server , to put in the cloud , a swimming pool , a place , a stranger , somewhere in the world , and where to begin .
time to take a leap out of prison is a completely different story , and it &apos;s unambiguous depends on the slide .
perhaps lost one hour .
it could take months months .
this  UNK  in this photograph almost is almost all the way back to the west bank , or nerve , and the other parts of the brain is .
it takes a time .
now , all these images have been degraded , water poisoned , water poisoned , water poisoned , bacterial spores , sometimes , during a sewage , for a period of time .
we couldn &apos;t afford the milk ; he couldn &apos;t do it , and it &apos;s hard .
we did a quick deal with his hands .
there &apos;s a great woman who tried to teach us .
very easy to add propriety images .
the school team of  UNK  : i &apos;d say it would be like a tattoo .
you can &apos;t make mistakes .
the woman gives us these eight photos , when they get to recover .
she had passed away from the book and they realized that he was doing it .
there &apos;s also a copy of his photograph .
if not , for her husband and her face , she never would have imagined , but she could just put herself in a different image , and again and again .
when he texts his words , we had a little bit of his story .
these images are my male colleagues have found in the middle of a fire , between the bands that have been dead since , and they got him .
on the tsunami , you &apos;re responsible for the tsunami of the tsunami .
he had to go to the stream .
secondly two little boys , don &apos;t remember two children , boys are secondary boys at school .
one result in the stream .
it took a week , they had found that and they knew that all of them had survived .
i &apos;m going back to her her son the youngest son of 14 .
for her , after all of this , these pictures were a gift for him , he had a sense of that , he could memorize the past prior to the past .
six months later at the top of the time , the  UNK  volunteer to volunteer ,  UNK  , in hundreds of thousands of pages ,  UNK   UNK  , most of the — — — most of the majority — — most of the time -- most of his time had spent most of his time , was too much about the importance .
over the last 10 years worldwide volunteers gave to the more than 90 percent , families hundreds of thousands of images completely changed and recover .
in this time , we didn &apos;t just have a thousand dollars dollars , and it &apos;s almost exactly the cost of the ink .
we take a picture .
each picture of someone speaks to something or something , a relationship , a dear friend .
these are the objects that the memories and our memories are , the final thing is that we finally laugh and the first thing we &apos;re looking for .
that &apos;s the significance of this project , , small pieces of humanity , bringing us together .
when a photo was brought back , it would make a huge difference in their lives .
the project has generated big differences in the lives of his life .
for some people , they &apos;ve been connected with something larger , for something that &apos;s based on your device to something else , but that &apos;s actually a texture and texture .
i want to read a email to end this email . from email to an email , someone who helped me to send me back to the next shot .
&quot; when i work , i can &apos;t think of new and  UNK  stories stories of pictures .
it took a photo , it took a lot of women from home , from home to young people , around the children , a child , i was struck by my family , because she had a similar picture , my father , my father , my daughter , my daughter , my daughter , my daughter , my daughter , my daughter , and i was born , and my daughter was born on the wall .
the other on the globe , even though , the need for our need is is , right ? &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m staying in  UNK   UNK  in ghana in ghana .
air humidity around dust and  UNK  , and it &apos;s very , very low .
i can feel  UNK  from the  UNK  that  UNK  jump through the shadows numb , but i can &apos;t see .
i hear a voice , but it &apos;s almost kind of a mixture of their hours a vacuum , and they got a lot of crude tools , so they absorb water .
as a person , i wear a  UNK  on top of a foot , it gets closer to this rubber , and i can &apos;t be able to see if the trees will be  UNK  anymore .
when you slip in front of my little sister , a few days ago , a couple of days ago , fell into tibet .
when i talk to you today about these people , these people are still waiting to die afterwards , they live , they don &apos;t live or  UNK  , and often die .
i was shoved away from them , and i was recruited , but home , maybe they &apos;ll never get home , because it &apos;s got wrinkly .
over the last 28 years , i collected a local cultural diary in 70 countries in the country , and in the middle of the continent , i was honored to be honored to exhibit the museum of exhibition in the u.s.
and amongst other people who are great inspiration to me , and i met a petition campaign to liberate a campaign , a member of a slave named  UNK  .
we started talking about slavery , and frankly , i started to know about my life , because i knew that it was in the world , but that wasn &apos;t .
after the talk , i saw real , humiliated and really worried about this , and in my life , and i thought , if i don &apos;t know , how many people know what ?
it started  UNK   UNK  , so a couple of weeks later , i went to los angeles to see a slave and asked them to help them .
and since that begins to bring the world in the modern world .
weird is that i &apos;ve been largely most of these places .
some places i &apos;m saying i &apos;m home .
but this time , i want to see the truth .
a conservative estimation gives us more than 27 million people in the world today .
twice the number of people get out of africa from the slave to the atlantic ocean .
150 years ago , a  UNK  cost of three times three times the size of american worker .
that &apos;s the equivalent of 50,000 u.s. dollars today .
but today , a lot of generations have been passed away from 18 generations , it &apos;s just 18 .
in fact , it &apos;s more  UNK  than 13 billion dollars a year around the globe .
a lot of people are being rejected by the promise of promise of good education , good jobs , just to see yourself , not working with violence , and not resist .
as a slave today is trade , where people have enslaved , who are creating debris and debris .
sunitha krishnan is almost everywhere in the world , whether it &apos;s illegal illegal everywhere .
in india and nepal , i got a  UNK  .
it &apos;s weird landscapes like a  UNK  in the  UNK   UNK  .
all right in the lower than 10 percent of the men , men , women , child , the whole family ,  UNK  in  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , i lifted up and down the road , and they picked up a lot of black holes .
UNK  is  UNK  and  UNK  , and they they quiet , and 16 times , 16 and 16 hours , and 16 hours a day .
there &apos;s no relief , in the middle of food , so it &apos;s expensive , so it &apos;s so expensive .
and the hot dust is so ubiquitous that my camera is so hot that i couldn &apos;t get to touch the button .
for 20 minutes , i have to run back to a parking lot of equipment and  UNK  them to regulate temperatures , and when i &apos;m sitting there , i think it &apos;s better for the camera .
go back to the rubble , i just wanted to cry , but you puke to the next slide , and i quickly say , &quot; oh , etc . &quot;
he explained that very clearly explained that it is very dangerous and say , not to me with them .
i couldn &apos;t help him directly .
i didn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
i &apos;m not a country .
i can get them into the situation of their situation .
i have to rely on organized to run the operating system to release them , and they trust me .
for me , i have to go home to the real world .
in the himalayas , i saw children through a mountain bike mountain miles down to the road down there .
the big panels are bigger than the children who are carrying their children , they  UNK  their heads up using their own voice , from  UNK  , stick and bags .
it &apos;s too much .
how can we create this  UNK  , what happens ?
some people don &apos;t even know where they are turned into slave trade , they don &apos;t work 16 hours , but 17 hours a day , because they spend their life .
they don &apos;t have to compare to comparison .
when people were waiting for this village , they  UNK  their  UNK  .
these people don &apos;t have anything , they  UNK  , they want to ask housewives , but in the middle of the middle of the woman , and calls for people , and  UNK  and  UNK  , and it  UNK  the way they  UNK  it in the legal department of them , and they actually have their own egos .
we tend to think about sex about the sexual slavery from &quot;  UNK  , &quot; and therefore i understand this , because i &apos;m going to be hard to get to safe in this industry in this industry .
in  UNK  , i was struck by women who were  UNK  .
they led me to the narrow close down to the basement .
this is actually not the church .
it &apos;s more than a restaurant restaurant .
restaurants restaurants , like , known as it is , in terms of  UNK  .
everywhere she &apos;s small , she says , women , children , young women , and children are old , some of seven children , forced to their customers , even buying their food and alcohol .
the sleeping room in the hive and the  UNK  found is covered in black holes .
we do a lot of people have to sexual sexual control .
stand in my corner , i remember feeling that scared of bleed , and that moment , i had to understand everything in hell that was hell in hell .
it turns out there : the staircase itself .
there &apos;s no  UNK  .
there was no big windows .
these people have no escape hatch , when we talk about the topic that is difficult , it &apos;s not just a slave , including sexual slavery , which is where we live in life .
tens of thousands of people were raised in agriculture , in the restaurant , in  UNK  ,  UNK  , and in a long list .
recently , the new york times reported reported that from 100,000 to 100,000 children to be sold .
it &apos;s around us .
the textile industry also used to think about the slave slavery .
i &apos;ve been a lot of village in india , where many family  UNK  .
this is the family .
hands up in the hands of his father , his hands and his son .
they mix in the frozen boxes , and put it into the west ,  UNK  spanish , reading it .
my storyteller tells their stories .
they said , &quot; we don &apos;t have freedom , freedom .
but still hope for that day , and in other places where we &apos;re told .
that means that we have more than 4,000 children , they &apos;re at the , , they their world
again , i went through a roll .
i see the same as a family tree on the zodiac , two brothers , a little boy , a little bit better , right ?
wrong . they &apos;re sold .
children were killed away from families , and for the missing , and not attracted to work on these boats , they don &apos;t know .
this boy is eight .
i &apos;m shaking when we came close to the boat , and so on the boat to go through the tiny little girl .
he was terrified .
the branches branches from them to  UNK  them , fishing and fishing and  UNK  and  UNK  .
many of them are drowning .
what he was , was being arrested .
it &apos;s too afraid of women , and not treat them from being  UNK  , and they &apos;ve gone down to the small girls , but they &apos;re smaller .
and i met these little boy at 5 a.m. , when they &apos;re taking the end of their uniform , but they did a job in the morning .
in my glow .
notice that these grid are near freight .
i want to introduce kofi annan .
kofi annan from a bottle .
i met him in the bailout that run the bailout of slavery .
so here i &apos;m trying to get there , and the  UNK  , and the , , , , , , when , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , , better family , and , family and and and family and alive and their home , , families and support their families and support their
kofi is the embodiment of potential ability to embody the embodiment .
how am i going to be somebody if you stand up and stand up and change your life ?
driving car drivers in ghana , but also his colleagues in the united states , he sold a drug  UNK  that he takes off the vehicle , and we turn on the window and the window on the window .
he told us to follow the footsteps in the woods , in the woods .
at the end of the road , he drives us , and he drove him to walk .
and just in this space , and this says , &quot; this is the word , this is the word . go away . &quot;
stepping along , we  UNK  the footsteps of legs , and after one hour of the forest , in the woods of the water , after the rains , i &apos;d like to take my head out of the air water when we went to the  UNK  .
after two hours later , they end up to end up to the end of the land , and in front of us , and in front of us , is a  UNK  tiger , they have  UNK  .
a lot of women  UNK  on the back of the the while , and the  UNK  flow of water .
UNK  is used in the process .
these  UNK  are sold in a segregated in ghana in ghana .
when out of the door , they sold their own  UNK  .
i remember when i look at my eyes eyes ,  UNK  tired of them .
but the next six of my  UNK  , they got infected with bags , and they moved to the other part , and they spoke to other places where they got to get the gold .
looking through the site , it seems to be healthy , but when you look closer , there &apos;s a lot of interruptions , working with kids .
they were victims .
in fact , many of these people are going to end up like this , like  UNK  and asthma .
this is  UNK  .
when the eye is lost , it &apos;s inherited inherited , and it &apos;s forced to go away in this long .
when i met him , he has 14 14 years ago , and in the wound of a leg that you see here is a prisoner in the middle of the accident .
on top of all ,  UNK   UNK  , tuberculosis still work .
and yet , he was still free to be considered to help with the help of local communities , as a prisoner , and , like this , so , on the face of the face , on the face of the face of the face of me , the incredible challenges .
i want to take a slave away .
when i work in this field , i brought a lot of contacts , so with the help of my view , my voice , to communicate with the people who i wanted to take that picture , and i wanted to understand the story of their story , and when they came to their faces , and when they listened to their faces , and when they came home with me .
they know that their image will be seen by others , like you .
i want them to know that we &apos;re going to do them for them , and we can do anything that help them change their lives .
i truly believe , if we treat other people like the human beings , it &apos;s hard to get rid of crime .
but the photograph is not about myself , it &apos;s about human being human , and people like , and as i am , is equal to each other , equal respect , and respect each other .
there is no one day i &apos;m not thinking about these guys who aren &apos;t going to have a great honor .
i hope those images will make a clear power in the audience , but as you will lose , and that power will spark the flame , that flame will fire it with the flame , rather than  UNK  , because there &apos;s no blood flow in the middle of the  UNK  .
thank you very much .
