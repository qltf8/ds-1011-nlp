and he comes to the , and he closes his voice , and he sounds , if he comes back to the daughter &apos;s office , and that &apos;s going to happen .
&quot; how could it be willing to talk to her men ? &quot;
we go to the gowanus canal and the circumference of the gowanus canal .
every single case in particular case is special , so it &apos;s a different story .
and you might agree with this .
my behavior is going to make them worse than worse .
they don &apos;t know .
and it &apos;s one of the things i prefer to be better than the legislators .
and i was able to finish by the end of my crazy book .
the people around us will be able to help us make better life better .
the second thing that &apos;s domestic domestic abuse is starting to violence against violence .
three months ago , i was a photography photographer , and i was photography .
and i often think about why they have  UNK  .
when the photographer continues to go to sleep , i wear my hair hair .
when i was seven years old , i first looked at the press , but i think i was living in north korea .
how are we going to intervene in the field that we &apos;ve got to get rid of it ?
the first question is , how do you be ?
we were clinging to the door of the stadium ,  UNK  rooms , and we had no way back to the sunlight .
so i have a idea .
and our  UNK  bodies was very well .
my father was listening to his four little brown eyes .
so they decided to kill these lions .
these are people who are being buried in ghana .
so what we need to do -- that &apos;s shut up .
it &apos;s estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the  UNK  islands , and it &apos;s the biggest  UNK  of the world .
and the trick here is to use a simple , simple sentence , just to make sense , even if you don &apos;t understand that , and then give feedback to some of the images of the senses , and gives us a deeper understanding of our senses .
he had an incredible memory .
that &apos;s 20 .
ready for college .
i grew up in san francisco at a friend of mine in belgium , and i looked at the  UNK  , the catholic church , the catholic church , the catholic church , the catholic church , the catholic church , the catholic church choirs , the catholic church , the catholic church , the catholic church , the catholic church , the catholic church of afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , al jazeera , and we don &apos;t even know what it means .
you don &apos;t have to believe that story is so exhilarating .
i see that it was a village in bangladesh , two bananas , two kids , things like that ?
these pictures are very easy to implant .
what are we doing ? we &apos;re looking at these  UNK  . we put them on them .
sensing contains nutrients , especially if you &apos;re heating .
and i &apos;m going to get tired of 45 minutes for 45 minutes to buy a spear .
and at the same time , i found a switch , can control light on the light .
this is one of them in six countries in the national park .
and it turns out that there is a lot of advice .
cilia and ducks  UNK  and they &apos;re quiet , and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again for the same day .
and because it &apos;s tactile , because it &apos;s not warmed up , and i &apos;m here .
now i &apos;m not a psychiatrist , dissidents , but not professionals .
we &apos;re trying to go to the relationship between the relationship between the relationship and the relationship .
and that &apos;s what we started looking for survivors to help us .
it &apos;s working-class people &apos;s leaders . you have them for them .
some of you might not be too familiar with hearing about this term , and it &apos;s made by a complex brain disorder , and the social  UNK  barriers , and sometimes social movements .
and finally , this  UNK  will bring more and more damage .
we need all of you to have a secret to each other .
they know that these photographs will be seen .
and i &apos;m confident that you &apos;re going to see more and more and more and more and more and more on the on
but what if patients could do that ?
silks contain more than 4,000 million people in the world today .
we walked for a week in buses , and a few times a lot of times .
so there was a whole bunch of drunk tigers caught abducted , and she asked me if i could get her on the house .
but of course , all kinds of organizations and blood pressure , which is very hard , and so we &apos;re going to call the scientists to think about the user interface , to the user interface as a health organization .
there was no artistic director , no  UNK  , no  UNK  .
well , what can you do with that bullet is going to be able to kill , and can your
the green restaurant is used to be part of a public service .
thank you .
i was gasping .
from the proverbs , all of these words said to each other , and how many of you , who are you who are healthy , who is the disease ?
the  UNK  meant meant to me as much as my child as a child . &quot;
UNK  is one of the most  UNK   UNK  of the united states in america america , in the united states , las vegas 19th century , umbc , my granddad , father keene , father keene , father keene , father keene , father keene , father keene , father keene , father keene .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to be one person . &quot;
and the answer that they would expect is , &quot; if you &apos;ve got a little bit more , if you &apos;ve got your hair , &quot; your hair is going to be you and you &apos;re you
in tana toraja , it &apos;s really important to be important in tibet , because in places like places like places like  UNK  , there &apos;s no  UNK  , no wood , there &apos;s no wood , there &apos;s no wood wood , there &apos;s no  UNK  wood , there &apos;s no natural resources .
the state of ghana has led me to teach teachers to teach students .
there &apos;s no one-size-fits-all name .
they got me wrong , and i told them that they don &apos;t have to use food .
and the reason why it is associated with  UNK  and  UNK  is that the fight against cotton .
because we don &apos;t have the hippo .
so , at this point , i heard a person who said , &quot; how ? &quot;
&quot; before they die . &quot;
but now , do you know how many countries have president ?
you know , taking a camera photo to a stranger , and unusual and unusual .
so what do you have now ?
today , i did .
for the first time , i was trying to find the secret of the secret , and i lost my head , and so on my head dips , and so on the head of my head .
i &apos;ve got harvard professors at harvard university class , and then i got a lot of money from pharmaceutical companies .
i didn &apos;t .
so what we did was , we took these  UNK  and thousands of times , each time each week , every time , every single shot of data , and then from a few seconds , and we came up with a bunch of images that we saw earlier .
it has 26 feet .
there &apos;s no one ever ever done in the world as payroll and selling financial services .
we have the  UNK  in the world .
i know this little bit of private , but i was young .
i want people to take it off , but also , i hope hope people can get healthy . &quot;
the events of events happened in the camera , and when it was done , it was filtering through time and space , and we could do that .
and that means that i &apos;m going to delegate another person in my soul as a servant .
what i want you to understand is that these are not my pictures .
and that &apos;s why i got involved in the world trade organization , which is the first time in afghanistan , which is the only cookbook in afghanistan , because in afghanistan , let alone girls to be educated .
you can talk about some examples , stories , stories . so it &apos;s all about you to talk about the content that make us excited about what we &apos;re excited about .
it was in the morning , and i was in
this was a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 years ago , and i was trying to explain the september day 9 / 11 happened to try to get this child .
and even when we met  UNK  , my family was slaughtered by illegal logging .
let &apos;s talk with the ceos and restaurants .
in this time , we didn &apos;t have the equipment for materials or  UNK  , most of the ink .
my friends are with me .
well , she has a photo array .
so every week , we all have the instruments in biomedical  UNK  , and people are coming back to these people who are showing them these pictures .
but if we don &apos;t change the gut , we &apos;re never going to do that .
we live in our family , seven years of  UNK  , who are responsible for their father &apos;s disease , and the same thing happened to me .
now , this is a little bit more  UNK  than the brown of the brown &apos;s highlighted . it tells us that the special structure of the ancient structure is very powerful and even the design of it .
but two words .
they have overlapping relationships .
i have a child with a  UNK  yogi , married three sons .
and so what we &apos;re going to care about is how we &apos;re going to live in a sustainable way of sustainable hunger , health care , health , transportation , transportation .
and the other thing that the second best thing about gayla is that it sounds ridiculous -- it &apos;s kind of odd to listen to the time .
on march 11 , 11 years , as the rest of the globe , i looked at the tragedy of japan .
but some interesting things happened .
let &apos;s look at this one . this is a little bit .
i &apos;m not a citizen citizen .
now , the ceiling goes into the bottle , and that &apos;s our bullet , through the tube .
because it has a lot of it ; it &apos;s noise , and it &apos;s quiet .
because it doesn &apos;t happen .
but now , 50 years later , we can take a million hits a year , but not only one tenth of 100 seconds , or two seconds , but one of those 53 seconds , but one of the 100 billion people in the world .
it &apos;s more like a restaurant .
in a 100,000 community , we have 200 customers .
and your kid , your colleagues , your friends and your family , and the
in 1902 , charles darwin was diving in the ruins of the atlantic rowing , and found out in turkey , and he said , &quot; these  UNK  , the  UNK  of the birds , the birds of the birds .
and that &apos;s the reason why , at the university of the university of the stadium , the wall street , the future of the the future .
and within a few months later , i realized he was different .
we seem to be  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , and all of us , we &apos;re only two , two , the two of them
in this picture , i actually did not have a boyfriend .
and on my left , my father was gestated in the womb of the country .
i don &apos;t know , the second is the victims .
so i found a old shutter  UNK  , an  UNK  , which is a small piece of a motorcycle , which is a small piece of exhaust , which is a combination of  UNK  motorcycles .
dh : okay , well , that &apos;s amazing .
the idea that your ideas are simple to simplify it .
&quot; i &apos;m helping people in north korea . &quot;
now , the real reason i &apos;m going to be prototype is that i &apos;ve got a good gene , and i &apos;m the
i &apos;m a very patriotic victim , because i &apos;m afraid of domestic violence and development .
sound waves , grief , and  UNK  .
and i think it &apos;s really easy to think that it &apos;s incredibly important to remember what &apos;s really important .
and we &apos;ve taken all the raw data into the mall .
so , why am i doing this ?
so i broke my silence .
what would you be ?
when i was three years old , i was very excited about my family .
and as you can see , this river is a very small , long strand of  UNK  into the  UNK  to china .
when i met him , he used to work in 14 months of 14 months , and he said , &quot; and he said .
it &apos;s not saying that our mothers are not important for us .
however , there are hundreds of millions of people who suffer from disease , and they have to suffer from severe injuries , and so we have to cure the symptoms of  UNK  symptoms , and so we need to have the tools of tools that we need to have .
it &apos;s a cigar in the car seat .
i read one of the most well-meaning men in the republican , and it was traumatizing .
now , longer and longer and more and more and more and more of them are coming back and forth , and we also need to have the opportunity to help these photos , and i went to facebook , and i &apos;m going to facebook and talk to each other , except for five days , they have 80 different countries .
you &apos;ve read it .
so this slide is not just boring boring , but we depend on our brains in our brains .
so you &apos;ve got a four-year scholarship . richard  UNK  : yes .
i met julius caesar , and he was  UNK  . it was cold .
of course it &apos;s boring to be slow , a 10-foot pole .
and he didn &apos;t remember my chocolate sweetheart , but remember that i had my brother and i had four days when i was six years old , and we were watching this little  UNK  on my arm , and i had four days on my arm .
instead , as einstein said , let &apos;s make it easier , rather than simplify .
help yourself a giant duffel soda .
i had no idea that i was living in a state of living in the north of my life , but i realized that there was a sense of life , but i realized that life was just filled with the dangers of starvation , and , of course ,
so , the result is that we make a material that we manufacture materials with multi-material materials , and we &apos;ve got a lot more energy than the power required , and it can make a lot easier .
but the word for the first center of politics is very important , and all politicians are understanding that they have to try to try to control their control .
my family didn &apos;t have poverty . and for me , i never felt like a hunger .
we found that they would travel in different countries , and so if we focus on an area , you have a hard time .
and i ended up being able to come back and forth , and they were never going to go home .
but when none of these kids were there , and if they don &apos;t have a sense of food food , they &apos;re just lousy to eat food .
even if they learn to chinese , they find their entire world as well .
that &apos;s exactly what i wanted .
i mean , of course , how could they do that ?
maybe one hour will be able to fix it .
first of all , you have to give them the promise .
when they hit the tsunami , when you get the tsunami on the tsunami , you have to spend seven hours of  UNK  , all the rest of them , all the rest of them .
they were victims of violence .
and what you see here is the cavitation of the material .
UNK   UNK  . they didn &apos;t create this title . i mean , it was , but it was an old lady .
&quot; the taliban arrived ! &quot;
thank you .
they occasionally have some little meetings with some of the board meetings , and there &apos;s a rule of government , but it &apos;s really nothing .
can you imagine a 400 people in a 400 , and a lot of
sometimes , school was suddenly a week for a week in the taliban .
what happened ?
it &apos;s like the graffiti artist , and they &apos;re building walls , and i &apos;m doing it lawns .
i can &apos;t give them money .
now , i &apos;m interested in applying mathematics in a mathematical investment , which is a special problem that we &apos;re both interested in management management .
they think they have a chance to get past and over again .
through the secrets of his talk , he shares an amazing leap forward in the sense of humor , and he told me that he was starting to grow his legacy at the time , and cruelty was to dutifully at the time when he was in eighth grade , despite the fact that he was very upset .
the neuroscience test is  UNK  , and they &apos;re using existing infrastructure .
he had a tremendous amount of treatment .
but if other people aren &apos;t , what do you do ?
so , starting with this slide here , we started with the first step , and we started  UNK   UNK  .
and the first program we did was written by the first book called &quot;  UNK   UNK  , &quot; and in this case , we were , we were teaching our food to save our agricultural food .
there was no  UNK  .
this material is kind of  UNK  , if we &apos;re going to the city suburbs , like the netherlands , we &apos;re going to
and as long as you go to the model , because they have the oldest hair , the most beautiful hair , the most beautiful clothing , the most beautiful clothing of the world is most likely to be the best woman in the world .
so after five years , i went to my sister sister , and i was sitting next to a secret school that was not allowed to be interrupted .
for example , for example , in the end of the year , the press government press conferences reported published in the  UNK  .
and what do you want from ?
and the reality is , when you &apos;ve graduated from you , you &apos;ve got a lot of work and you can &apos;t do something else , so if you say you wanted to be president of the united states , you have , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
after five days after eight seconds , on the left side of the neck , i woke up on my mother &apos;s father .
that &apos;s why the white in africa is called  UNK  , which is the boss .
just before i started my new life , i received a startling call .
some other hero can be invisible , but imagine a future in the future : he can see the
it was a small fishing fishing , and it &apos;s about 50,000 people , and it &apos;s about about 50,000 people .
who could invent technology to college ? college ?
we can reduce the questions of the
for seven weeks , all volunteers and all the residents , and they found something like this .
it &apos;s hard to find any more powerful than that , and that &apos;s charles darwin .
it &apos;s almost impossible to walk across the north coast of san francisco , so the irony is , i flew to china to the border .
i was convicted .
the arabic said .
so we have the machines in the lab that we &apos;re going to fly .
but the third thing you can understand is , and it &apos;s also very important , and i want you to remember that this thing , and that &apos;s the title of the pope , the philistines of the federal government , who never heard of .
within a year , i did 27 projects , and the government was asked to ask me , &quot; what do you do ?
all those of the effects of the tsunami , all the effects of the tsunami , in the saltwater , and of bacteria die , and in bacteria , and even bacteria , even in the stomach , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , all of these , all of of them , all of of them , all of of them , all of of them
she was retired two years ago , and she kept my family into a school , working-class girls and women .
i didn &apos;t want to be able to do this beautiful day , but it wasn &apos;t the people who didn &apos;t care about the people who were there .
and all of these projects come from my own puzzles , how many of my neighbors ?
they didn &apos;t want to call him the king of his king , or his  UNK  .
and i know some of you might be interested in this view that you might be able to read some circles ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
and i wanted to know that i had an idea that i had an idea of what was going to be in the purview of conflict .
but if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t let go out and look at their  UNK  , we don &apos;t have good communication .
we &apos;re going to send this light up , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the light will flow into the direction , some will end up with the vocal chords that we end up with the vocal chords , and then we &apos;ll be able to go back and forth , and then we &apos;ll be able to go back to the camera , but the very interesting is going to come back to the camera , but the most interesting thing is going to reflect back to the camera , but the
i &apos;m afraid that these changes in the u.s.
and once you get it , it can also expand .
it &apos;s a  UNK  . richard richard .
find a new technology that &apos;s going to be developed , and
but the hardest part is to go to gender and evil traditions , because my own is the biggest stunt .
people were taking pictures of the text to send it , and i was very privileged to get their trust , and let me start with them .
he got a black rubber rod ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
a real school .
so i went back to  UNK  , and i couldn &apos;t expect to cry , but my  UNK  fellow  UNK  , who came up with me , and he said , &quot; yo  UNK  , don &apos;t get there . &quot;
they &apos;re just  UNK  birds .
and recently recently , if you look at the news in kenya -- kenyan kenyan shillings , like  UNK  and  UNK  .
and today i &apos;ve been a proud of college graduates .
it &apos;s a quick story .
what does that mean for the patients who can go to the clinic ?
it wasn &apos;t fatal , but it wasn &apos;t fatal , but it was very painful , and we were going to fix it , and we had to fix it .
for the first time for the first time i was in front of my wedding outhouse .
&quot; before i die . &quot;
thank you .
some of them were actually said , &quot; this is her fault , &quot; as if the victim is a victim of empowerment and intentions , their men .
this was an amazing architecture that had been touched by a place where none of these people wanted to let me smile , and myung  UNK  , and when i was in trouble .
everybody else has changed .
i was going to go to 50 50 miles of  UNK  , and i was 13 years old , and i was
all around the globe , the boundaries of the present , we have some of the most basic requirements we don &apos;t have , right ? &quot;
and when you look at the same night when the lion hits .
and i thought that i was going to go to the person i would keep going to stay in front of my man , but in fact , this was very , very viscerally .
i don &apos;t know how to get there .
and if you can make puzzles , i hope that we can all agree with the power of the power that we can understand .
her name was  UNK  , and she &apos;s just like me , like my mother , and she died .
my dreams are great , but they expect to expect me .
if you have any stimulants , i &apos;m going to go and to go back .
&quot; we don &apos;t free freedom , and they said .
and we said , &quot; oh , my god &apos;s name ! &quot;
when i was 14 years , i made a decision , and based on the healthcare budget , i founded a working system called  UNK  , which we mustn &apos;t edit , but we don &apos;t do anything about it , but to inspire people &apos;s lives .
when he was cornered , he had to go to the beginning of the tsunami .
maybe it &apos;s going to happen to you .
i always always watch the camera .
for him , child is more risky .
hetain patel : who &apos;s top of you ?
because the dictators couldn &apos;t sustain the natural environment .
i was scared frightened , and my heart was blown away from fear .
no .
the next mayor is going to washington ?
and i began to realize that lions were afraid to move around .
each other passions was built on self-assembly , and that &apos;s the most important thing .
and in afghanistan , i realize that this is the western state of the west -- and that &apos;s the fact that he &apos;s the father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s father , and he understood his daughter &apos;s success .
it &apos;s like , &quot; am i going to die ? i &apos;m going to stop ? &quot;
and i wanted to see a program called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; and military operations in afghanistan , with a police station officer at the end of the race in palo alto , and then sent it to the car , not to give them a money , and instead of giving them the money to come up with our name .
you don &apos;t have to design a new new hospital .
i live in new york , and it was 14 months in the last year they were relocated by a group of young black and latino , and most of them were young boys .
how can we be able to share our shared narratives about the architecture of our building and better understand our land ?
even though i was lucky enough to go north korea , i had a lot of my staff .
he doesn &apos;t care about religion . he never heard about it .
you need a machine like this , an analog device -- it &apos;s used to cook .
remember when i was standing in a dark , i was stunned with grief and i felt confident that i was thinking about what was going to be in the hell of the hell .
so for example , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , it &apos;s about 10 times less than 10 miles per gallon than the average temperature than the  UNK  .
no , it &apos;s a global fight .
but many people tried to die .
that &apos;s her .
we can also live in a world where people live in the north plains of san jose , because we &apos;re all connected to the rest of the world in san francisco , and we have to go back and forth .
now , we &apos;re starting to rebuild  UNK  , but we don &apos;t know how the smartest smart person wants to use their own money and energy .
i always say , &quot; i &apos;ve been discovered , but it doesn &apos;t tell you .
and so we went to this one , and i went to see .
and here are some of the great goals that i have here .
we have to learn how to engage them .
and so this is the valley of the greenland norse , and we &apos;re not very surprised .
&quot; we hope , &quot; oh my god can go to the room and other places where we can get paid . &quot;
and he saw a villager in a neighborhood called  UNK  , which meant to be a victim of a victim .
today , i want to talk about a very disconcerting problem with the disconcerting answer .
and then over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the course
for example , for example , the german ford motor .
so so , we don &apos;t know where the camera comes from the door to the door , and we know that the distance between substance , but we don &apos;t know where the dot is .
and especially if you &apos;re on bike bicycle , it &apos;s not good .
help me to rediscover the wonderful and beautiful ,  UNK  ,  UNK  the future .
in order to change the world , we have a good connection to our scientists and engineers .
at the end of his uncle , he was going to keep track of his uncle artie , and he was forced to work at work .
he comes from a needle .
this is los angeles :  UNK  hotel .
and i thought , &quot; what am i going to do ?
so i &apos;d like to propose to you one of the ways that we can try to do this , because you know , in a sense , in a sense , at least , in a sense , at least , it &apos;s like a friend of mine .
UNK  hotel ,  UNK  .
now , at the time , they were able to take back of these photographs of their time , of course , of course , depending on the damage .
and even a couple of years ago , kevin kelly muses , and how he and how he and what we did .
in china , i was a little girl with a little girl .
can you get ready ? you can buy the money ? &quot;
what do you have to do ? you can act , make your business , and you can tell them your governments and tell them what we need to do , and we need to pay attention to these terrible animals .
no one knows what we are .
&quot; when i was able to train those pictures , i made sure that the person of the photos of the photos .
the next question is to say , &quot; how can they photograph pictures ? &quot;
i even had my own intellectual identity .
i &apos;m just floating in six words in six seconds .
so , in our papers , we published &quot; the nature of the natural natural world , &quot; and they created this animation .
there was a terrible famine famine in the &apos; 80s .
we tested lots of projects , and the government had seen our results , and they decided , &quot; well , that &apos;s interesting . &quot;
so for me , i have to wait to go back to my heart .
the life of war and  UNK  , who created this kind of closeness and style that was designed by the soldiers and the  UNK  stagehands , and i brought it into a phalanx of ammunition , and i took the local  UNK  to the top of the forums .
and it turns out to be a  UNK  restaurant , family households , families , more than the family .
and just a few years later , we had the first time in the  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
this is the only way we have in our primary education .
and i &apos;d like to put together a simple  UNK  and  UNK   UNK  to put together a look at the wall and talk about how to moma and how modern art , from the kosovars of the injustice of the evil spirits , to make a difference .
so we &apos;ve come to the door , and i &apos;m going to spend the rest of the border police officers in the border .
it was very time-consuming .
this is l.a. .
they have all kinds of jargon , although they say that , but it &apos;s not fashionable when it comes to speech .
now , since i &apos;ve been working on a daily basis for our family community , it &apos;s very useful for us .
she explained to me when she was five years old , she was standing in the photograph of that .
there may be the result of some indications of  UNK  hazards , even divorce  UNK  , even divorce  UNK  ; initiating support for the family ; the family planning to fight the victim of the victim and the children .
as my fellow  UNK  tzu said , that &apos;s like a tattoo .
and i would expect to be able to  UNK  the  UNK  organization , and , believe that they can
you have to get clinics in the clinic , and it &apos;s pretty pretty large , and it means , in the clinical trial that never ever done this before .
and if we could make the materials induce , we have a solution .
in fact , for the sake of my daughter , they &apos;re usually the most  UNK   UNK  , but in socioeconomic like afghanistan , we have to support the men .
so that &apos;s my burden . you ?
at the time of the tsunami , at the time of the tsunami , at the rate of 23 feet , the marshes doubled to two miles .
and although he &apos;s holding my head down with a gun , with me , put them on the ground , threats to the dog on the freeway , and i &apos;m getting ready for the restroom i &apos;m going to get stabbed on my feet , and i never thought that i was being enslaved .
this is a satellite satellite picture taken from the night of winter and  UNK  .
people are going to be deserted .
we use our hands .
and when she came up with this picture , she shares stories of images of images .
i read a book when i read a book ,  UNK   UNK  , which is called &quot; the great gatsby , &quot; author , &quot; author , &quot; author , &quot; author , &quot; author , &quot; the author of economics , he says , the economic development of economic growth is , if they don &apos;t want to help someone to help them .
thank you .
you can &apos;t have any  UNK  , you &apos;ll get it off .
but sadly , the nervous system , the nervous system , like treating parkinson &apos;s disease , as a consequence of the destruction of my friend eli pariser , who was the  UNK  dancer in his era .
it &apos;s going to be sacred to us .
you can ask your ideas about your client .
and i stand here today because i &apos;m a prototype .
now , if you take this gun , these photons come up with this bottle , and these photons are going to get wet ?
we just moved to a new town -- and i thought , well , i think it &apos;s a safe farmer -- and he &apos;s buying a gun gun .
thank you .
i couldn &apos;t give them any help .
and there &apos;s a sleeping mat on the bed table , and it rained in the pocket .
they would weave the meat into the meat of the meat .
the fuel fuel is  UNK  .
i don &apos;t look like the typical male victims .
now , i thought that we were in charge of africa , but when i know the americans , in the united states , the  UNK  , the , was , , was ,
in india and nepal , i was sent to the  UNK  .
well , i got a couple of times when i was a woman named  UNK  .
so the last question is , &quot; what does it feel like ? &quot;
so the senate won won .
so this is the first picture of my first graphics , and i had no hair , and i didn &apos;t have any protection .
this is our time for our time , is one of the most exciting time in our year .
i want to make sure that lions are giving me women as if i &apos;m standing next .
i have a video of kamal .
but we don &apos;t ask them to say , &quot; and we said . &quot;
driving the road in san francisco bay with a  UNK  , with a  UNK  , and a half an hour around us .
if you can &apos;t get off , you can &apos;t eat and eat , and they don &apos;t need toilet toilet .
and the reason i decided to leave that because of the last 52 of hubris bombing , i had the limits of confidence .
you know , it gets more blood flow when you get the fish .
i &apos;m going to put shoes on it now and see what happens .
so these are these kinds of things that i think we can open up to the top of the high line , the scientific method of engineering and engineering .
i made this device two years ago , and since then , we didn &apos;t have 43 lions .
so no doubt , his kids should be educated , including his daughter , even though the taliban had a risk .
the air burned in the air , it was hard enough to breathe .
so there &apos;s a second option : harnessing  UNK  .
at that time , we don &apos;t know that journey will change our lives .
and one of the most precious things we have , is a time with time and connection .
in south asia , some countries like india is going to die in india and pakistan , which means that they &apos;re going to die in 10 to 15 years , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re sentenced to die in the order of the farc .
the recent study also showed that the areas of the areas that we don &apos;t have to survive in the places that we have , in the  UNK  , to the , , , .
so this number is that twice the trade of trade in africa .
we don &apos;t have to close our neighbors , so even if we live in a communal sense of a public space , it &apos;s not  UNK  .
thank you very much .
we &apos;ve done survey studies of 100 million jobs in the world -- financial pharmaceutical companies , ceos , ceos , ceos , nobel prize , the company ,  UNK  , and all of these companies ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
we are a free organization , which is based on a variety of different religions , and all of us are all volunteers .
that &apos;s what i felt with my students with my students , and i felt amazed by their ideas , and i hope that other people can experience it in the air .
i was investigating investigating for this talk , and found that 61 percent of women who didn &apos;t like their children to go to 17 , to 70 percent .
i hope we &apos;ll give them some of them .
sometimes , ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen , and they &apos;re sitting in front of them , and they &apos;ve taken their pictures of their own photographs , and at the end of the month , they can send images from the next 10 hours , and then they upload them into a stream , and they upload it into a bed net , and they upload it into a blanket , and they upload it to the other end of the earth .
and i thought , this is the natural of natural gas , and a half acres , but of course , the eyes of the eyes .
the gun was a clear signal to me , although he didn &apos;t take a gun to me , and i hadn &apos;t  UNK  at the edge of time .
so we can teach our kids to educate education , english , training , etc .
in 2009 , i lost one of my loved ones .
and so we put the book in food food , and we thought we were just going to go shopping .
so this was very fortunate to us that these pictures were so fortunate .
but lions are really smart .
i saw my gardens and brought me tools to education , and i became a tool for my community .
it looks like this .
many people don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know what it means , but i can tell the father &apos;s really great .
and when i say , every single person , i &apos;ve come up with a new campaign .
&quot; why did she leave her ? &quot;
in korea korea was much more difficult than i was thinking .
back to my question : why am i going to go ?
he didn &apos;t tell you that .
and the only thing that you can see here is that if you have to get out of your taxes , we &apos;re not going to pay for your money .
so what &apos;s the problem with these problems ?
they &apos;re all government-funded .
i don &apos;t think for free , because it &apos;s not sustainable .
now we &apos;re  UNK  at the university of minnesota , and we young minister richards , and we started writing richard branson , and this is the kind of task that i showed up with  UNK  , which is how much it works with richard nixon .
and because somebody tells the position , that influenced his life to change the future .
and when you go out of this room , you &apos;re a little bit of  UNK  , not only tell you about your home , tell you about your story .
but i &apos;m very hard to maintain that everyday life .
this is an aerial picture .
we &apos;ve become domesticated , we don &apos;t get them anymore , but we &apos;re very impatient .
it &apos;s wavy food .
and the reality is , because their mindset is inconsistent with social orthodoxy , and often often misunderstood .
and you have to pay attention to their passions .
and we do that , who knows we know .
and i &apos;m going to show you some of the puzzles that i &apos;ve ever since i did , because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s like a  UNK  sitcom , but it &apos;s only to
so what happens when 40 years later , 40 years later , then , in the year 2000 , the country was 420 sq. -- 10,000 , 2,500  UNK  .
we sent her up to the end of her picture .
so when the officer was approached to my home , and i had my courage to tell him about it .
when i trust my perspective , i was a woman and a woman who had never been there .
so that &apos;s what we do . what you &apos;re looking at is the market economy , and of course it &apos;s not going to work in the past , we don &apos;t know that .
and of course it &apos;s going to be resolved , but we have a solution .
now , because of the engineers that i &apos;ve worked with , i have learned that i was exposed to my academic life , and i wanted to conclude with a formula for me .
and it &apos;s going to happen .
we &apos;ve got 300 million projects in the world .
thank you .
over the world , 20 minutes , there &apos;s a new guinea tragedy of 20 million years later , although it &apos;s one of the benefits of the increase in global growth , but we don &apos;t know how it &apos;s going to treat it .
her photo was actually taken by her husband , and in the local end of the local  UNK  , the area was actually far away from the ground , and they identified him .
how can we live from the distance to the more and the end of the
what can we look like ?
some tiles came out of desks , and so you start to see these structures .
UNK   UNK  told me that you &apos;re looking for  UNK  , and tell me that you &apos;re looking at  UNK  because it &apos;s very important for treating cancer .
we &apos;ve got two trillion dollars in the last 50 years since the last 50 years .
children have been taken from their homes , and they work on the ground jobs , they don &apos;t swim .
at the end of the taliban , the girls of school had to go to school -- please don &apos;t forget it , it was illegal .
government ?
when we speak backstage , we &apos;ll give a answer like this .
if someone had to say to me , that i would say that i would say that i would say that my men would have a day to say , &quot; my life would be a day i would like to hold my life and i would spend a lot of time with whom i would like to work with , and what i would like to do , how long and how long i could do , you know , if i can &apos;t hear a lot more or less juice , or cruelty  UNK  .
first of all , why would they give us the bad thing ?
&quot; before i die , i thought it was going to  UNK  . &quot;
remember , when i remember , a mother and daughter , at the time of evenings at night , when i was watching my  UNK  , and when i came out of them , they were very vain .
well , i &apos;m on this stage on the stage because i &apos;m an amazing woman , and we &apos;re betting we saying that we call this &quot; girl girl . &quot;
otherwise they &apos;re not going to talk about you .
at the age of 21 , we thought we were  UNK  , and we were doing good for africa .
you can guess what &apos;s going on .
and then , after a while , and more and more and more and more and more and more and then i later -- i don &apos;t demonstrate that .
so the daughter of the daughter , the wife said , &quot; hey , why would you go back to new york in new york , and then come back and forth . &quot;
so , in the future ,  UNK  imaging tile in your cell phone , you can go to the bathroom , don &apos;t get there .
but i didn &apos;t give up giving me .
the solution to solve is is using the glue .
so it &apos;s not a bug .
in fact , i &apos;m a typical parent victim , and also the typical immigrant .
at the beginning , he made me feel like william  UNK  .
they got their own title .
we &apos;re  UNK  ,  UNK  .
the next question is to ask me question : &quot; am i growing up when i grew up ? &quot;
there &apos;s no comparison .
so what i wanted to do is i wanted to make this more attractive .
thank you .
no matter how many other factors -- each one of us has a common desire to say , &quot; normal , &quot; and that &apos;s purely perfectly valid .
he knows what love is love .
this is the part of the  UNK  border .
so i stand here today with a blood cell in afghanistan today , and the gods of my love in love with a  UNK  political party and a progressive political artist in the past six years .
you know , darwin taught me about the u.k. after the u.k. and the change , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
and you can read this book called &quot; deadly aid , &quot; and the author is dan  UNK  , a palestinian woman .
it takes a lot of water in water .
and i found out that americans can see the missing in our lives .
the country i grew up in decades .
that &apos;s the primary principle principle .
you can become the president of the united states , or the inventor of the internet internet , or the  UNK  of the  UNK  the poet -- it &apos;s good -- because you &apos;re the first .
some people don &apos;t think that they &apos;re working on their daily 24 hours every day , because they &apos;re born with something like that .
it &apos;s far more than that .
one year ago , i was just one of the big boys in the united kingdom , and i was looking at a ordinary boy , and i was looking at the plane , and i was looking at the plane planes , and told myself that i was in there .
my family was trusted .
a couple of years ago , i read a very interesting article on a magazine .
but it &apos;s selectively selective selective .
they can actually eliminate all the bacteria in all of their bodies , and they absorb  UNK  the spread of the spread of the spread of the virus and causes them and death of disease .
he was convicted to london in london , and he was very brave , courageous enough , and courageous enough to support this , and he ended up having a support for the support of his life .
when i was 22 years old , i graduated from harvard college graduates .
and i realized that if i wasn &apos;t outraged , this man would kill me .
and so we got  UNK   UNK  , and about seven hours a day , and i took this shot , and i put it on my chest .
and the fly is using the material in the netherlands , on the netherlands , with little tiny little salt water , it absorbs water , and it stops raining , and when it comes to the car , there &apos;s no loo .
it &apos;s everywhere .
at that time , i had a ph.d. &apos; s , and i tried to get rid of that kind of weeks from the ground .
because in the end of the domestic , domestic violence was killing her .
sheryl  UNK  : i know that electricity is already , but i just wanted to do my own .
i want to change this view . i want to change the way that you think about these bad things , because they need our compassion .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to do something completely true myself . &quot;
by the way , there were several specialists who invited people to talk about the future of new york city .
and one night , i had caught in front of a taxi at the time , and that night , the king was not coming .
so most of the time , most of the world trade organization is going to work for 500 million dollars .
because i had to worry about every day .
we &apos;re going to stand in every aspect of your friends , friends .
how can we tell us that the expectations that are interested in creating a new technology that allows us to come up with us ?
everything was ready .
and over the course of this journey , we were walking down , and she paused , and she pointed out of a red flag , and she said , she was a little girl who said that she was like , and she was a little girl who started with her early days earlier .
what can you do ? you can manufacture them ?
these  UNK  are about 90 degrees of water , and they  UNK  bundles of sand , and they &apos;re trucked out of the hive , and they &apos;re trucked from the other tube to the gold .
the noise is going to disappear .
so we started making action action .
i want to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
many of them are being judged by a promise of the promise of  UNK  , the good education , good jobs , good jobs , the jobs of the jobs , the jobs of the and the and the
he wasn &apos;t speaking , but it was the joy of the joy and the way it was the best speech .
it &apos;s the most important to the
today i still remained silent silence .
first of all , i want to give you an idea of what you &apos;re interested in .
this is  UNK  . his father &apos;s dead when he died .
prices are very low , and we know how to do it .
but this is self-assembly .
so over the last few years , i tried trying to put together a little bit of different things together , and with these cnc tools , with the simple tools and sharing objects in the public space .
i told you a secret .
i &apos;d like to share with you some of the people on the wall .
i moved to new york , and i began my first job as the &quot;  UNK  and &quot;
as an iphone , they agree with  UNK  , but they also need to be sure that they shouldn &apos;t be sure that they &apos;re not supposed to agree that they &apos;re not supposed to agree with this statement , whether they &apos;re not agreeing with this statement , whether they &apos;re not loyal to the state of affairs , whether they &apos;re not loyal to the top of the country , whether they &apos;re not loyal to the top of the country , who are going to be sued by the governor of the  UNK  , who are
and i didn &apos;t know that it was the first step of the relationship of domestic abuse .
we were frightened , but we still want to go to school .
we hope that it &apos;s not like that .
we &apos;ve actually helped 40 million businesses .
and that &apos;s when he was discovered in the night , and i discovered that i woke up in the morning , and it was dead , and my disappointment would fade , because it was my only cousin .
and all of a sudden i seem to be part of my country country as a country .
&quot; i did not , &quot; we &apos;ve got 32 times .
i see the redwood center like starbucks .
so i scraped the black dots on my chin , and the brown smells of  UNK  brown , and i looked at the  UNK  of the  UNK  .
these are molecules who are advising the election to go to the public to the public , the &quot; , &quot; me ! i &apos;m a jihad -- i &apos;m a jihad , am i ,
and they had one question : how to face it , george w. bush , their leader .
when i look at the people around me , it made me feel a shame , and it helped me to do it for people , and people ask me , &quot; don &apos;t you pay people to food ? &quot;
we &apos;re often pictures .
he was frightened to fall into the water .
there &apos;s no human eye .
we need to help everyone else .
&quot; before i die , i &apos;d like to meet everybody in the audience . &quot;
afghanistan is different .
it &apos;s a very painful thing to see .
i don &apos;t know anything about this experiment into this experiment , but the next day , the walls are going to whistle and have to come up with a new answer .
but we still get a huge amount of data coming from different different data , and the point is different , and it &apos;s different from the different environment , because it allows us to resist the negative externalities of these disorders .
i &apos;m talking about the secret of domestic violence , and i &apos;m going to answer questions , and everyone &apos;s question : &quot; why is why she &apos;s going
when i was in eighth grade , i was eight times eight times a week .
and there &apos;s a lot more of history .
let me tell you why .
all of the successful businesses in the world is only one thing : there is only a business executive that can be porous .
and in the end of the road , we drove off the driver .
and the reality is , i went back to dinner at home at night , and he told me that he quit his job , and he said that he &apos;s because he said that he &apos;s because he &apos;s because i &apos;ve taken his career and feel secure , and he doesn &apos;t need to have his vision of purpose , and he doesn &apos;t need to go back to the city , and that he just wanted to leave the city of the city .
i want to share some of the best ways to tell you how to make sure that we can offend your science and sexy .
and if they increase their tomato , they &apos;re eating .
it &apos;s an amazing fact , and that &apos;s the level of heating needs to be able to survive .
so we plan to plan a plan .
but my mother had become a teacher .
&quot; it &apos;s on the verge of hunger . &quot;
he wasn &apos;t sick , and he didn &apos;t care about the skin .
and when you look at these dams , they &apos;re moving away from us .
so there are some climbers in the states right now .
it &apos;s odd .
i don &apos;t know about you , but my own personal story , except for 15 minutes , i won &apos;t be in the family .
and if you go through this path , you go to the  UNK  -- that &apos;s what we see .
the mall for the freedom to peace freedom is so unpredictable .
they didn &apos;t even go to the monarchy monarchy , and the idea was that you could be an election of kings .
and i say to all of the police , neighbors , neighbors , my friends and family , and i &apos;m standing here today , because i &apos;m sure you &apos;re helping me .
my father -- that &apos;s what he was -- he was the first person he was educated .
i grew up in new orleans and i loved it .
some people want to call it king .
and as you can see , this  UNK  is  UNK  , because lions lions .
my new school continues to join , and helped me to raise more and more money .
and i do believe that when we tweak them as a result , we don &apos;t have a lot of shame .
and then i thought about a lot about death , and then , and lo and behold , and this is something that made me feel about my life with my life , and to me about my real life .
now we &apos;re taking them into the living room and some other places , but we can put this technology in a car , so we can put it in the car , because we can see , we can go , and we can go , and we can look at the orbits , and we can look at the orbits on the window , or we can actually build on the window , and we can actually look at the orbits of the solar system , and we can even look at the heart .
many photons are finally going to get out of the caps order to walk around .
but today , the girl in afghanistan was over 300 million .
and when we talk to the end of the talk , i felt really bad for myself , and it seemed to be honest about how we felt so much , and i don &apos;t know how many other people i don &apos;t know ?
it makes us believe that we are not alone .
i &apos;m going to answer the question that people ask me questions about the questions that i &apos;ve asked me .
i &apos;m going to leave you with this conference at the conference of this conference , and he said , &quot; can we can &apos;t imagine -- imagine you can &apos;t imagine it ? &quot;
and the great divergence of these dictatorships have always eluded my soul ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  me , and me ,  UNK  me , and .
but there was something else .
the second fact that i would say , a lot of people think that it happened to be women in women , and that should be a problem of women in women .
so i &apos;ve become very angry .
for example , in july , only in japan , we set up the  UNK  of the high plains ,  UNK  , baltimore , baltimore , baltimore county ,  UNK  county to coast .
and here &apos;s the person who &apos;s health in this room , and we think of ourselves as a voice of the voice , because when we hear it , we have to coordinate these  UNK  , these are the  UNK  genes .
first of all , it &apos;s my favorite place , all of the things that i &apos;ve ever found in the library , and the president of the clinton administration has never seen before .
so that &apos;s the gun .
and sure enough , instead of a surgery , two days ago , two days ago , i think we were essentially impossible to change the appearance of our natural world , though , as opposed to our lives .
i can &apos;t get the numbers in the north pole when i left south korea , but i can only say that it was the hardest part of the famine , and i was sent to china .
what &apos;s your next question ?
when a month ago , he and his daughter at the way back from school to the village , they were attacked by a bomb .
it &apos;s not easy .
the second thing you can see is that the u.s. government says this is just a temporary occurrence -- it &apos;s going to continue to save years .
and then we helped them to collect information about information and information , because of the world ,  UNK  .
what &apos;s the problem ?
but soon , people complained about it .
they told me their story .
don &apos;t have a business plan . no one .
and the year later , we went back to new york city , so we decided to take a same picture .
there &apos;s a problem with the community meetings .
i was a fifth letter , a completely stranger .
any health or a disease or disease or disease , you can go to sleep , and every five senses , every time , every time , every time , and every time i &apos;ll be glad that we &apos;ll be able to announce our only three hours a month .
now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to get through the light , you only have little light , but we need more light footprint , so you don &apos;t get any light .
my first answer is , &quot; i don &apos;t know , because they didn &apos;t let me . &quot;
my 12-year-old husband was born for 20 years for three children .
now , there &apos;s a lot of going on here , so let me show you .
and the next generation of conservatives is  UNK  .
we can override the data stream .
what &apos;s going to happen ?
we can do clinical trials in clinical trials , and it &apos;s very low cost , and we can also transmit the scale of the number of times .
look , i los angeles in los angeles .
you tell them what they &apos;re doing .
and i &apos;ll never again , and i &apos;m always going to have a warning tone in love with my gun .
now , in new york , young black men and women are only 17 million young men in the south bronx , and so they &apos;re not saying , &quot; am i going to be ? &quot;
you know , it &apos;s probably going to happen .
and for her , despite the disaster of suicide bombers and  UNK  , for those days , the photos of the son of the son of the son that he gave him his son ,  UNK  , memory , that no longer felt that he had changed his life , and when he changed everything , he changed everything .
now , in west africa , some of the people who don &apos;t have the tyranny of hatred and  UNK  demand .
add you in strawberries .
the primary principle of compassion is respecting respect .
this is the first time .
and i love one of the words that i love is called  UNK  .
they &apos;re so elegantly elegant . charles darwin once said that he changed his vision , and he saw the  UNK  in the air .
at the time , when i was driving with my friend , she was a bad driver , and we got thrown out of them , and we said , &quot; hey , we go ahead .
now , if i used a laser pointer , and then there &apos;s a second one second half seconds , and i &apos;m going to add up , and i &apos;m going to make some molecules , and then i &apos;m going to make a couple of tons of molecules , and then photons , and then photons are going to be up to the speed of the speed , and the speed of the speed .
kenya , all over the world , will have a loss of loss of life .
i think the answer is there .
i &apos;m working with computer simulations for stefan sagmeister , and i was exhausted , and i was exhausted , and my anger , with my hands , with my hands on my neck , and i couldn &apos;t breathe , i couldn &apos;t breathe .
that &apos;s the rebuilding rebuilding .
no ! they were slaves .
and he pointed to me , but fortunately , he believed me .
and by the way , if you go to the  UNK  clinic , 300 million dollars .
we play a ballet dancer and  UNK   UNK  , and you laugh .
this kind of business enterprise , the leader of the corporate sector , you &apos;re face-to-face with your kitchen table , or your kitchen table , to help you build a resource for your skills to save lives .
so it means that people can do with phones phones phones , and then do it for your phone and then do this test , and then people have access to their phones , and then they have access to their messages , and then they have access to the point where they are in the face of the disease .
so what i &apos;d like to say is , i think , as we are .
it &apos;s not just the nature of our natural waste brine .
we are the soil .
because i can &apos;t decide anything that you can become part of the american publishers of the united states or the ceo of the united states , or the ceo of a  UNK  .
they burn it in boiling water , and putting them into a pile of water into the tripod , and it turns out that they &apos;re toxic .
we also have the opportunity to start looking for disease in the early days of the disease .
so -- -- the government says , &quot; that &apos;s done . &quot;
and that led to the journey of my life .
it took 10 feet to the size of 10 feet .
i mean , with seven million americans , i live in food , in los angeles , los angeles , los angeles , los angeles , los angeles , and los angeles is  UNK   UNK  , and they don &apos;t need to get out of the service of the  UNK  .
and i thought i was terrified of my crazy love , and i didn &apos;t realize that i had already made a  UNK  monument to a control of control of your body and your economy .
so that &apos;s why i became the global jihad of global jihad , which is a global organization .
and it &apos;s fast as fast as 30 seconds .
lc : yes , you can say , &quot; the civil society and  UNK  , &quot; why don &apos;t it &apos;s time for space and time it &apos;s easy for us to understand .
and so i worked with some remote collaborator to the house , and i put together a big hole in the house with a giant napkin , and i put together a giant board on top of the house , and i said , &quot; before i die , &quot; before i die , i thought , oh , every single one of them died , i would like to see , &quot; every single person in the snow , i &apos;ll be able to take a look at it , and so they &apos;re going to be able
that means that patient patients themselves .
she &apos;s not  UNK  . &quot;
i found 50 meters in ghana .
this guy also has to fight the treaty and the  UNK  .
but if you take a look at this site , you &apos;ll notice that when you walk around , you &apos;ve noticed that , at the end of the month , it &apos;s always drifting .
let &apos;s go back and make our beds , our kids and family became the safety of peace , peace .
and as soon as you can see , just like this , first of all , you know , it &apos;s a little creepy stomach that you can see , this is venomous poisonous , and it &apos;s a horrible misunderstanding .
but this time , i &apos;m going to go to the secret of
we &apos;ve assembled the community communities .
and two weeks later , i spent hundreds of 150 members of volunteers , and they &apos;re willing to join us .
and when i stand here today , you know , these guys are roaming in 2004 , there &apos;s no money in the mines , there &apos;s no shortage of corruption .
he was sharing his love with tenderness .
and one day , the worst nightmares i had ever since i was sent by the chinese police officers and brought them to the police officer .
why ? because of tomato sauce , and they &apos;re suspended in the back of the chorusing toads .
i &apos;m not going to talk to you about the amount of money .
i can feel that i can feel  UNK  people from my waist , but in my darkness , i don &apos;t see anything else .
so these pictures are far more than just a record , or a special trip .
and in fact , the results of this experiment was that , if we invest in four years , we &apos;re going to use this envelope with our robotic machines -- we &apos;re going to take this machine down here , and we &apos;re going to run the roads on the road -- we &apos;ve only got to go through the four hours of the seven years .
because of the same thing , the , , , , ,  UNK  , , , , the , , the , the , the , , the , the , the , the , the , , the , , ,
zambia is a saying , &quot; yes , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t move . &quot;
ah , he was ready .
but i was starting to think about them that they were taught me , about personalities and love , and i realized that i wasn &apos;t going to use my normal job .
i had a library in cambridge , and i went to a store and i forgot to buy them with me .
and sometimes i saw the water from the water .
and some of them , in a nutshell , led to a few other things , and more connected to their society , such as the community , their communities , not just for  UNK  , and  UNK  .
and despite the fact that i happen to believe that we survive our lives , because we are so proud of our lives .
so if i think , if i get , i &apos;m going to take the bow to the garden , so we can pull things together .
when i was a kid , i think my country was the best in the world , and it was a , ,
you want to explain why art is called the bullet ?
now , i &apos;m feeling helpless in this room , because i shouldn &apos;t wear a dress .
even though we &apos;re all darwinians , but our self-deception has become very different , because of 30 years .
i used to be a human being .
and i wanted us to be environmental ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
we need to deal with the governments around the entire region .
and as a result of being used to be being watched by disney -- just as a dog , as ram ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
i live in a house in this house , and i want to make it a better place for a better place to think about it as a better place to think about my life .
school was in a house in 100 houses , and we live in a small living room .
so many years ago , i had a thought , why couldn &apos;t we have at least at least at least once they were listening to them , instead of keeping our ideas ?
and when he was growing , he became more vulnerable to this particular place .
it &apos;s a little uncomfortable with euphoria , and the good news is that i don &apos;t want to wear them .
my partner byron and  UNK   UNK  , we couldn &apos;t wait for dinner , and so i decided to develop them for three weeks .
it &apos;s not necessary to go to the clinic .
when i arrived at the end of the house that i sent home from my home , as a punishment , my family had to be detained , to move into a remote neighborhood .
and at the same time , i &apos;m thinking , if there is no way to get healthy food , what happens if you don &apos;t get home from your home and see what happens when you get out of your food system .
he was afraid of condemned , and swore , and he was forced to  UNK  because he was used as ransom as he had been treated with him .
we cleaned up a huge amount of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  fish , the fish , the fish in the factory .
the utilities organizations start with maybe 20 centimeters .
everything i did , whether my life was going to work on my life -- i wasn &apos;t going to be done in seven years .
there is a major part of the continent growing up in the americas , like the americas , venezuela , venezuela , venezuela , with other parts of the continent , and there &apos;s only 16 risk of death .
we have seven billion people in seven million cell phones .
but it needs to maintain it .
and the secret is that i used to be thought that i think is a man with my soul , and i just put it in my hands , and it was too many times .
now ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  has been banned , in india , india has a positive attitude .
thank you .
now , the possibilities of change and changed the way we want to be .
when we were at the end of the industrial revolution in the industrial revolution -- we use non-lethal weapons to develop manufacturing fuels , and so we realized that it &apos;s not sustainable .
in the cold , cold evening .
but no one can help them , because you don &apos;t have your own family .
and during the course of this century , it was painful , and the life of the life that the life that life and the life of the life that the most vulnerable of the life .
we have volunteers team to help reforestation for the  UNK  and resource extraction , and we can see that the collective wisdom of the local community can remake change the communities and the economy , and as long as you can use people &apos;s attention , and it &apos;s achievable and this .
reality and history provides this logo .
it &apos;s not going to be in your system . and when it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a business model .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
these girls are lucky .
he said that when he was a child , he would have to have the gun .
why didn &apos;t i quit ? i have a lot of opportunities .
and when they come out of mines .
he got a black rubber rod ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
let &apos;s try to win a definition .
and i hear the voices around the room , but it &apos;s more noise that eddy merckx in the stone axe .
thank you .
we were sitting in the subway subway in new york , and he said to me .
well , are you going to have another electronic invention ?
we don &apos;t want to washington d.c.
now , like ze  UNK  , a scientist , science scientists , science and science became an art , and  UNK  , and i realize that we spend a lot of information about it , but it turns out that every aspect of technology , and this is a new technology , and it &apos;s just a new set of measures , and it &apos;s just rearranging a bunch of little compositions with just a few seconds .
and for me , this is the most profound question that people ask me , and you can &apos;t understand , but only if we are victims of who are leaving our eyes .
if you think about death , you get more conscious of your life .
so , because we have a camera camera that &apos;s a camera camera , and this camera has some special faculties .
he looked at everybody &apos;s notebook , and ask the question .
i was working in a business model ngo , and we were in africa every single african project in africa .
tomato is used to  UNK  .
so someone suggested i was  UNK  , and police officers tested my firm , and i asked me a lot of questions .
but unfortunately , i &apos;ve got to tell you , in dr. zullinger , a ph.d. in collaboration with a colleague at nyu , the number of people in the world is based on dozens of people who are in the  UNK  academy , and there are less than four percent of the people who don &apos;t have five percent .
i &apos;d like to tell you about two brothers .
we all know that we are stewards of  UNK  , teachers , students , and parents .
when i was 11 years old , i remember one day and i woke up in the morning that i had hearing voices .
the winter is comfortable , but it &apos;s summertime .
so scientists and engineers , please talk to us .
after i went to the emergency room , with my family , my family had been released , but after a month , they were caught up .
and what we did was , we collaborated with the clients , we had to build a society that we had to build a better society .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ve had a lot of hate , but now , because i invented my dad convulsing , and lions and we were able to lions .
you have the capacity to avoid the domestic .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to live forever . &quot;
and it says , &quot; when you read that letter , my family all of five of them are going to die , because we &apos;ve taken two weeks for two weeks for two weeks .
it &apos;s what we call clonal  UNK  .
thank you .
don &apos;t get it wrong .
so , for example , this isn &apos;t the logo , i can &apos;t let you see him as he &apos;s my father &apos;s father .
and after the second jirga , the senate didn &apos;t stop .
please let me say , &quot; normal . &quot;
and it was a very surreal sense , like walking into the  UNK  or the  UNK  .
so they give him an idea that they can think of the most beautiful , most horrifying thing .
shortly after that , when i walked through a railway station , i had a very painful thing to me .
my mother had heard of it .
he merely stress , and frantic , weddings , my aunt and my family members of his family .
it turns out that the center of the local railway is gathering people &apos;s lost photos .
in fact , every three percent of women in the united states have had a domestic victim or a potential target , and a half percent of children who have been married , and a million unemployed .
not just because it sounds great .
new orleans have the most beautiful buildings in the world , but also also the most expensive buildings .
the public spaces can better understand what &apos;s going on in a public space that is really important to us , and it &apos;s more important for human beings , to be able to share our hopes for our communities , our fears , our fears , our fears , our fears , our fears , our fears , our fears , our fears , our fears , our fears and our experience , not only can help us create a better place .
it &apos;s not all of you can do .
this is the first time on ted stage , so i think it &apos;s very lucky to be here .
but how did it works ?
there &apos;s a plank behind the wall , and we &apos;re going to
it &apos;s about words and words .
so , we take a seed strip from italy , with a beautiful valley , and it &apos;s a gorgeous gorgeous  UNK  , and we teach them to italy and  UNK  and so on .
but the second answer , and that &apos;s the question that i want to say to ask , &quot; why ? &quot;
and what you can see is that the mid-ocean ridge is channelrhodopsin .
our scientists and engineers are facing our biggest problems , from energy to the environment to health care and so forth . so if we don &apos;t understand what they don &apos;t understand , they don &apos;t understand anymore , and i believe we don &apos;t understand anything about them , and i believe we don &apos;t have anything about it .
and for those moments , it &apos;s an amazing thing , and i &apos;ve been hearing all the time , and i &apos;ve been hearing all the time to say that i need to be creative , until i &apos;ve done it .
i &apos;m asking for one thing .
these people , they hated them , they wanted to give up , but the woman who had been elected representatives in the local church , and they gave them the same drug , and they would continue to pay for the same internally , but now they could be free for themselves .
i was fortunate fortunate to be married when i was a young woman
he told me two things .
the european union went to the foreign ministry of china to go to the vendor , but a lot of people were being shipped by china and they were beaten to the north pole .
that &apos;s my legacy , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing .
from 1974 to 1977 to 1977 , i was very young , but i was very old -- i was in zambia zambia , kenya , kenya , kenya , sierra leone , kenya , kenya , somalia , kenya , somalia , kenya , somalia , kenya and  UNK  technology .
the kindness of kindness aren &apos;t impressed with me , and the most demanding hope for the most demanding , and it resonated with me , and he made me realize that strangers are blessed with the support of the society and the support of our society , and our support for the rest of us .
the most brilliant thing we &apos;ve done in the last couple of  UNK  , is to me , and that &apos;s my
it &apos;s one of the most endangered .
but i did what i had to do , because my self was asking me to do it .
a lot of people think of what it means .
we &apos;re helping schools and houses , and cleaning up , cleaning up , to rebuild .
that doesn &apos;t exist .
thank you very much .
and this picture is a reminder that reminds us and some of us , some of them , somewhere in a place , somewhere in a place , somebody else .
this is the reason for the street .
and myung sung in his own world , using his hands of what he did , looking for fun objects , like walking around his eyes , and he looked at them and he would eat everything with his washing machine .
it &apos;s not born .
i live in los angeles .
so i was living in fear of fear , and i feared what my identity was discovered , and i was sent to go back to the north korea .
and those signs indicate that , if we could have a purposeful and shared opportunity to share the public space , the public spaces are going to be huge .
i &apos;ll never forget that morning .
so in the end , the senate won &apos;t survive , because no one will feel guilty when they &apos;re told that they &apos;re elected by the federal government .
in los angeles , people were cured disease .
i &apos;d like to leave you with this slide , and i got an email from here , from the age of seven , and it was six months from my family .
this is a picture that i took a few days ago in dorset .
so what i did was , i had food forests in my house .
in contrast , i &apos;m a woman named naghma &apos;s book , and i &apos;m the only person who is the only person in the world where people can help the face of themselves .
so los angeles times exposé , and ryan  UNK  wrote a story about its story and a palestinian group of directors , and they talk to the church , and they went to santo .
and we did this test , and we added a lot of , and using magnets that bombard them to adjust water and testing them .
if the kids grow up , the kids are eating .
unfortunately , more than 75,000 million civilian casualties are unemployed , and a lot of survivor are pesticides and herbicides and blood pressure .
in addition to this , he has ingested tuberculosis , and he has to have to work every day job .
so in reality , i &apos;m not  UNK  .
i did not have a chance to wear a two-inch heel , but not just anything i could get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t want to talk about .
i &apos;ve met a village in india where i visited a village .
and it means &quot; it &apos;s a political party . &quot;
this is what we &apos;re doing now .
the  UNK  is the most durable , and of the the the the the
the entrepreneurs don &apos;t have to say , they don &apos;t have to tell you what they &apos;re doing in the audience , and they what they &apos;re going to
we &apos;ve got about 50 people to participate in our team , and they all volunteers .
you don &apos;t have to change your mind .
the l.a. the l.a.
again , we &apos;re sitting on a bus , a bus  UNK  .
and then they took me . that &apos;s a miracle .
and so i took a lot of that candle , and i had a lot of candle in translation , and i put it in my hands , and i wanted to connect them with their stories and their spirits , and when i was filled with a series of photos .
we have to give them a commitment commitment , and respecting their privacy , and we need to be good at them with them , and they &apos;re just waiting for the doors .
and in the himalayas , i &apos;ve been able to the , , , , , , the the the , the
we &apos;re lying on the floor , our bodies are so sick , and we &apos;re going to die . &quot;
why do they think that &apos;s not good ?
thank you .
why should it be a  UNK  leader ?
so this light is going to make demons , and they thought that i was walking in a tree nearby , but actually , i &apos;m working on my bed with my big dreams .
and i hope that these images can inspire your eyes in your head , and i hope that the power of the power of the power that i &apos;m hoping to be , i hope that the power of the  UNK  be unleashed , because of , there &apos;s not going to
all right . thank you .
and finally , in a long period of travel , my family , reunited with my family , but freedom is not only half the
you &apos;ve got these tiles , and you can see that behind it , these are  UNK  .
working with  UNK  and  UNK  together , we wanted to track the data from all over the world around the world .
however , there is a secret sauce .
so i had to find a solution .
now , from this story , you can see what &apos;s interesting interesting .
150 years ago , an  UNK  price of u.s. dollars in america .
i thought i was in my lifetime , but i was still trying to hide my fear and humiliation and answering their questions .
these lights will go into the room , some steps back to the floor , and then go back to the camera , so we can apply this light .
i don &apos;t understand it .
and if you listen to them , or they said , &quot; no , no , i &apos;m going to work together , and i think , &quot; when my boss comes . &quot;
my grandfather was a brilliant man in his 70s .
so i thought , &quot; oh my gosh ! this is my responsibility , i have to maintain it , so i &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
the garden is really beautiful .
shortly after that , i got a group of volunteers who volunteers were volunteers for volunteers , a group of volunteers who were going to die in just a few days , just in a few days .
so i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we &apos;re doing .
and yet , what do we do ?
if you &apos;ve ever wondered if my life is better , i &apos;m happier ?
you can &apos;t stop transmission .
tell us why ?
one day , a week ? actually , it was a year .
and i couldn &apos;t deny the hard time , and i was thinking about them .
and of course , it has weaknesses , it &apos;s not enough that it can &apos;t be tar sands .
look at what &apos;s the african woman in africa .
it &apos;s an accident , and he won &apos;t hurt me .
but they do all those things that you might die in jail .
but in order to explain what it means , &quot; how does it matter , &quot; i want to take you back to the past the united states , and it &apos;s just about midnight .
they killed our livestock .
the first is that he graduated with graduate school in school , and in a very nice wall bank .
&quot; ah , this won &apos;t . &quot; do i ask you ? &quot;
and i assure you that there are people who are listening to me that there are people who are being abused or abuse , or you have a  UNK  .
thank you .
when i did this competition , i found a chance to be able to train children in their communities , a sustainable life .
and that was , in 1871 , the group came together , and they were all based on the city of 100 years , and they came up with the results of 100 years .
but for the first time , i was left with him some sense of humor and humor , and his  UNK  , looked like the farm boy .
thank you .
and every one of them gets bored , and in fact , because this debate has lasted for three days .
a lot of people cried .
barack obama , the president barack obama did today , just as it was just waiting for the senate .
there &apos;s not enough technology for the existing technology .
and we believe that we believe that we &apos;re bringing our animals and our family from the heavens , and it &apos;s why we value them .
on the left , you &apos;ve got our  UNK  imaging camera .
for me , afghanistan is hopeful and hopes of possibility , and every day at the end of the week , reminding the girl &apos;s nightly girl to express me .
so , on the day , i went back to facebook , and i asked some of my friends on facebook , and there &apos;s lots and dozens of them , and there &apos;s lots and lots of messages , and they told me that we should be corrected .
now , one of the things that i &apos;ve ever heard from my childhood , and i remember my head and threats to kill me , and i &apos;ve already hinted what i did .
and i thought , &quot; cool , just like that . &quot;
we have a very high-speed paradigm shift , and we put the ink matrix in a perfect matrix , and it &apos;s impossible to make it possible , and we &apos;ve been bombarded by media , but we &apos;re actually a brilliant artist , and it &apos;s an amazing image .
well , in the last few centuries in the past few centuries , not only in health , small and  UNK  and all of these  UNK  elements that we &apos;ve evolved from , and we &apos;ve evolved to live elements of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , black skin , black skin .
even months of months .
we can go .
this is the first time in afghanistan .
he asked us to come up with a ball to the jungle .
silk works is my graffiti , and i create my art .
i was in the last minute in japan , and i found myself in a  UNK  center .
because my family didn &apos;t understand chinese , so i have to help them go into the southeast asia .
so in japan , six months later , &quot; volunteers &quot; volunteers , &quot; $ 1 = volunteers , helping volunteers help us extract hundreds of thousands of thousands of hundreds of thousands of thousands of photos , and most of them -- most of us .
i saw the wheelchair as a paintbrush as a car .
this is why i need to preserve it .
in the spirit of the torah , the  UNK   UNK   UNK  , the  UNK  , , , , , ,
well , the dance is one of the  UNK  .
this is the most beautiful picture .
now we &apos;re still asking , why not ?
and then there &apos;s a slide show of powerpoint powerpoint presentation , don &apos;t use it .
so what i &apos;m talking about is that people get away from their streets , to make their sense of freedom and enthusiasm and openness .
the southern border in northern india is not  UNK  , and that means that the milky way around the world can move the outside world .
i conducted the experiment in the state state department .
i tried to take a member of the members of the  UNK  who had the heroes heroes .
you can be extraordinary .
and this is an important lesson that i think you can learn , and i want to leave you with me .
i &apos;m going to talk about you .
he was fascinated by  UNK  .
&quot; normal &quot; neglect , there are differences that gaps gaps are not wrong .
i was six years old , and the taliban had joined the afghan government in afghanistan .
i was 22 years old , and at the age of 16 women were 16 percent of women in the united states of domestic violence than the same age of domestic violence in the united states , and in the united states , there were more women or women who were more women or women who were raped or abducted .
the government has given us a highway that &apos;s going to send us , on the surface of  UNK  crater , and we &apos;re doing it .
are we going to track ?
and he pointed out on the other side of the ground and say , &quot; here &apos;s the road ! &quot;
it &apos;s not about the value of food insecurity , but the value of value is value .
and also as a ballet , it needs to train with special training .
so small roundabouts , women and children have only seven times a little bit better than their clients .
whether it &apos;s a big company to do this , it would be great to do the three things : we need to make sure that the price is better to measure the marketing .
it &apos;s all mexican warriors that they protect us from their families and their families , but they &apos;re also frustrated with this problem .
i &apos;m going to take another one .
we don &apos;t have infrastructure .
one dollar dollar can serve 75 dollars .
the next question is , &quot; can you get anything free ? &quot;
these two words are from the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the &quot;
it &apos;s like a stone cotton bag of cotton .
we tend to exaggerate the words of the victims of  UNK  ,  UNK  women , as the title of the news in the news .
where am i coming ? who am i ?
over 70 percent of domestic violence is happening in the end of the victims , and after she left , she &apos;s riddled .
and she started to take her on her sockets until she realizes that she had actually helped more damage .
this is where i live in kenya , kenya , in southern india .
&quot; why did you say that ? &quot;
it was almost every single place in the world , even if it &apos;s illegal .
at this moment , you might be wondering , whoa , that &apos;s amazing , or , &quot; oh , she &apos;s , &quot; but , but in the process , but in the process , actually , i &apos;m talking about you .
one of them was the grandmother .
that &apos;s it .
like me , they have a lot of dreams .
you can imagine , this town is definitely .
what we &apos;re using is we can clean needles with steel steel that we can wear needles in steel , with a glass shard of glass , and we put them in these little turret .
otherwise , in the picture , she and she &apos;s drawers that she can &apos;t get it anymore , and so we &apos;ve got to put all the parts together into a good image , and then we made this picture .
the worst news is that i &apos;m going to take away from my head because i &apos;m smiling , and so you &apos;re laughing , so when i &apos;m there .
and if these pictures aren &apos;t digested , we can &apos;t fix the repair , repair them , but they have to dry dry .
see , i &apos;m an artist .
every year , millions of years migrating north america , and returned to the north korea , and they &apos;re tortured and tortured .
it &apos;s all because they want to make their songs sound like that , like that , with that , for example , with the  UNK  , and so on .
we said , &quot; we can travel together and boldness , passionate about our work . &quot;
because my family didn &apos;t understand chinese , i was scared .
this is going to get light up .
most importantly , passion .
it &apos;s almost like time . thank you .
because , i &apos;ve taken the same picture of every year , our daughter &apos;s daughter , her daughter comes to new sights , and she &apos;s looking at her eyes and see how she thinks .
&quot; i &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
so there was a lot of people that i met , and i met , and i knew that there was a democratically coined by a criminal organization , organized crime in this organization called  UNK  .
our own food is like a  UNK  .
tell someone else &apos;s story .
a black woman is lying lying on the ground , a child who has a paralyzed victim , and the child has only paralyzed his mother &apos;s face .
so this is all about this project , and it takes a little bit of the amount of debris into human nature , and to get people from the past .
and the key thing that i believe is that there is a great communication between communication and communication .
how do you get ? &quot; and i said , &quot; i did something very hard .
and i thought that i was just a time with my family .
there &apos;s only one gene : i &apos;m walking down the staircase .
what &apos;s called  UNK  ? look at the stone mountain .
the light bulb comes from a  UNK  .
in fact , i &apos;m going to make it calm down , and you can see if it &apos;s effective .
you know , some people might not get us , or we can &apos;t .
there &apos;s an anthropic principle .
the other question that you want to ask is , why not ?
i &apos;ve read the first time for the first time in this talk , and i &apos;ve got to say , &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
there &apos;s over 500 million volunteers volunteers , we &apos;ve taken 90 of photos of transcripts of our family members of our lives , and these photographs are being beaten .
five years ago , i had a picture that was going to be an impostor on the road .
but they &apos;ll resist your smile , you &apos;re not happy .
jargon is our understanding of your ideas .
the first way i thought of is to use fire , because i know that lions are scared of fire .
thank you .
this is me .
we need to subvert the end of the end , and we need to know where the only way to think of , is the only way to think of when we have the
that was the first time that i heard most of my country in my country .
many tribes and their families , and when they come to new countries , they usually have very rarely money .
and i &apos;d like to tell you guys that i was lucky enough to change me in 10 seconds .
we wrote about it slavery , and that &apos;s where i started really understanding the reality of the world , but i knew that it was completely unsolved .
but as a conversation , the experience of my talk was just as a result , and the rabbit hole in the ceiling , and saw that driving the door to a whole new world .
let &apos;s get rid of your weapon .
and so they &apos;re sitting with them to talk to los angeles , and to bring it back to the los angeles , and so they put it together in the south , so they put it into the south , and it &apos;s just going to solve the city of the city .
he didn &apos;t start thinking about it .
these guys gave me a lot of money .
i really appreciate him , and he said , &quot; why are you going to help me ? &quot;
and over the last 28 years , i &apos;ve been photographing since i &apos;ve spent hundreds of thousands of years traveling together , and i &apos;ve been honored by the african countries , and in 2009 , i &apos;m honored to live in an independent party .
but let &apos;s try .
do they know our minds ?
it was designed by a group of amateurs ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , photographer ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , and their  UNK  , and then poof , they came up with them .
he &apos;s not just because my college is my college , and it &apos;s because i am the first one in women , and i &apos;m the first person to drive him in the streets of  UNK  .
and when you describe the scientific theory , you have to use it .
kenya is going to have the largest wind power plant in africa , which is called the  UNK  tiles that &apos;s been retrofitted .
and i wanted to talk to a group of jihad , and he day with  UNK   UNK  , the  UNK  goddess of eden , and with the threats of religion and the koran to the extent of
we see the same symptoms .
one of the children caught up by the end of the tsunami .
i got these because it was my physicality , not my identity . some people fought for them .
td : so i &apos;m also going to be outside of the world i thought i would spend my entire life in north korea until all of them vanished .
and the reality is actually because of a joke , this great name , erin mckean ,  UNK  .
let &apos;s see a whole new understanding of our neighbors .
strangely , the places that i &apos;ve been visited .
after that , one police said to another person , &quot; the report was wrong .
i saw these little boys in the morning in the morning at the end of the day , at the end of the day .
when the  UNK   UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , , , , , , , , , , all the of
am i  UNK  korean ?
the underside of the tree of a tree with a lot of tree glands , and the fishermen are going to come up with hundreds of thousands of miles , and the kids are weary and clean the net .
talk a little bit more and more and more colors than that .
but i &apos;ve been 14 years since i was 14 years .
even though they were caught up , but the great international  UNK  campaign , and they ended up .
and also , i realized that there were huge differences between north korea and north korea .
and i think this is the reason why we &apos;re in a  UNK  park .
in fact , these muscles that were mechanically ventilated , and they would have been seduced as a result of  UNK  and  UNK  .
in fact , my students backed up , i &apos;ve got to mention that , because he made a great job , and now he proved that he &apos;s been able to prove to the mobile phone , so we now hear the 99 percent accuracy .
they say it &apos;s ridiculous . you can &apos;t call him meetings .
so i want to share with you a sense of relaxation and conscious ideas .
and so , of course , they think , this technology is going to die in new york .
they took pictures of them to collect them together , and they put them together .
we have to create a completely new career .
i refuse refused to become part of my reality , which is part of my reality .
so what we &apos;ve got to do is we take discard water pipes , to asphalt the asphalt , and the removal of the climbers , the climbers , the black widow bites in the snow .
there &apos;s almost no dispute about  UNK  degrees .
that was one of my first moments of life .
i didn &apos;t .
so when i was preparing for this talk , i found that it was hard to find myself that i was able to find an outsider , because if i was standing here , and i said , &quot; look , i &apos;ve got the advantage of the advantage of my life , and it &apos;s not . &quot;
&quot; if you think , now you can kill me . &quot; and he said , &quot; but he said , &quot; but i won &apos;t go to your mind &apos;s my future . &quot;
it turns out that the  UNK  of the domestic abuse of domestic abuse , reducing the probabilities of reducing the victims of the victims of the victims .
the answer is very simple .
basically , if you want to meet me , if i want to talk to you , if you want to talk about some of those annoying chairs that don &apos;t let me tell you .
i &apos;m going to ask questions . you know why ?
you &apos;re going to be influenced by the kids .
otherwise , the woman &apos;s nose doesn &apos;t look like her face , and it &apos;s just as the king cobra .
i am a woman who speaks about this woman .
i had a hand up and thought that when he was a few hundred years ago , he was going to die for a few years ago .
&quot; you can go to a real school school , &quot; and he said .
but today , there &apos;s only one percent of the family income per capita , which is only 18 18 dollars .
when i saw my family , especially their fathers , like my father , even though they were watching their faces .
dr.  UNK  had this shot with the shepherd and the photos that made us feel about our confidence and curiosity , and this one of the photos of this picture .
at the same time , we go on table , and because in the top right-hand side , you can see that at the bottom of the top , you get to the top .
now , my approach has been trained in kenya with a lot of people using mobile phones to look like this , like a hyena , like a hyena , and so on the same , etc .
so taboo is the idea that we &apos;ve heard about , because the world as i say , &quot; global &quot; and i said , &quot; if i &apos;m taking this industry in this industry , it &apos;s going to be easy to get that promotion .
but again , i was happy and assertive and stood in , and i was still young , and i was still young , 20 or 30 , 30 or 30 , 30 or 30 and 30 years ago , and i had more and more and more and more and less and more and more and more and more and less and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and less and more and more and more of it than ever since .
and on the picture , he &apos;s going to spend his head out of his head , and the good news is that the good news for the good news is that there is a lot of time with my family and family , and they &apos;ve become a safe person to make sure that they make their own lives .
so with this technology , we can manufacture the beam of light , we can actually see our camera camera , or you can see the camera camera behind our eyes , and the camera has taught us .
in afghanistan , you can create a wonderful thing in the art of the artwork , but i don &apos;t really want to make sketches of what i mean by attempting to try to create the identities that i &apos;ve ever attempted to pursue the identities of the challenge , but explain to the reality of the challenge , to explain to the real world , or , to , of
i &apos;d like to give up , but my father would say , &quot; listen , my daughter , you probably lose everything in your life .
because of the large numbers of  UNK  , they began to livestock in sarawak in sarawak areas , and in the area of the north sea , the  UNK  of the greenland norse peaked .
at the time , what i don &apos;t want to do is go to new york city , leaving the rest of my life , but for myself , i think i need to do sacrifices . so i agree with my job , and i quit my job with me .
and it was amazing , 413 percent of the world trade is over 1.3 billion dollars a year .
as you can see , it &apos;s used by solar pumps to a battery , and it &apos;s made up with a battery .
the little eight-year-old was eight .
some of the people who don &apos;t have access to that knowledge , but we can provide support .
there &apos;s a possibility of possibilities .
that &apos;s argument about the debate for congress .
these things happen to us , and we just don &apos;t know .
so why is it really important ? first of all , it &apos;s an important part of the ecology of ecological ecology .
and even though , he dreamed of being able to live modestly as well as the catholic church , so that the help of education to help facilitate education , and this is the belief that i believe in awe .
it didn &apos;t go back to home , and i said , &quot; hey , though , but luckily , although we &apos;re going to go into the next step , i want you to leave you with your own apartment , and if you leave you with your own your apartment , i &apos;m going to leave you with your friends &apos; and &apos; and &apos; 60s and &apos; their city with their friends &apos; families .
so whether you look at the sky , or whether it &apos;s just going to be the next generation , it &apos;s going to increase the next generation , is to increase our new information , we &apos;ve taken all of the files and the details that we &apos;ve sourced , and we hope , and this , , and we ,
those dashboards  UNK  children are more malnourished than the children with the whistle , the rope , bamboo pads , and the  UNK  clothes and the pile of pliers are cut off .
in the age of the age of seven , i don &apos;t have six percent of the age of high school , and if it &apos;s not my family , it &apos;s like most of us .
he was born in afghanistan , and he had his vision of his life with him , with his daughter , with his daughter , and my mother , my mother , my mother , went to school , to support his father .
but the amazing thing is that you have parkinson &apos;s disease and other diseases , so you can &apos;t be able to do it as simple as detection as we can do it like this .
on january 13 , i went to japan .
now , i realized that there was a big part of the people who had lost their big sections .
there &apos;s a tree of a tree that weighs about 1,000 times a little seed .
i got a temporary opportunity to ted , and this was my first time .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be very respectful , more than &quot;  UNK  &quot; and &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
but i realized that this didn &apos;t have any effect , but it also helped us as a male .
every small band is very dark , and it &apos;s the same as the number of bells and  UNK  .
torture is unstoppable .
i remember that they had a long tail , and many of them had spent 72 hours of work .
i even had my friends back to my community , to help them in this room , where they were able to install them .
do you don &apos;t want to continue ? &quot;
when i was thinking about that picture , there were some millennials history , some of them in my lab in the lab , i thought i could raise them that they were able to fix them , and maybe i could be able to fix these seals and traumatized , and i was able to
you know what ? you can choose any career .
i was really frightened . these students brains merged , and they were reading their words , and they were timid to me .
i skied twice .
hey , i &apos;m curtis wong , and i &apos;m a prototype .
the people who work here are people who are brutally prisoners .
now she went to new york city , because she decided to go to new york .
and with other people , i had my camera mounted on a  UNK   UNK  , with a  UNK  sweater , attached to a black hole on the walls , and , of course , attached to the height of the tail .
even though it &apos;s not true for korea , but i &apos;m going to decide .
my first year was  UNK  out on the street , and i met the first group , and i helped my first clients , and i helped this first person in the garage . he was  UNK  , and he went to the  UNK  restaurant , and he went to the owner , and he went to the owner , and he went to the local , and he said , &quot; would you be able to help us ? &quot;
and i want to encourage you all of you in this room , don &apos;t come up to the picture , don &apos;t come up with the christmas party , &quot; can help us pictures ? &quot;
and i thought i thought i was walking into a couple of weeks later , and i went back to los angeles , and i went back to los angeles , and he saw the  UNK  , and wanted to make a difference .
so what i &apos;m talking about is the story of &quot; love &quot; love , which is a romantic love affair , and there are millions of women , even more men in bangalore .
look , really .
it &apos;s entrepreneurs ; they &apos;re doing it .
so , like lions like lions are waiting to follow them .
i grew up with my son .
i wanted to live a whole neighborhood neighborhood of the neighborhood , sharing the food .
it &apos;s also more and more and more and more and all around me , everything that i &apos;m surrounded in the night sky , except for the chinese walking through the underside of my apartment .
in the end of 50 million men in women , women , children , in fact , the whole family has moved to the size of a half-inch , and then the motors goes up to the top of a half-inch , and then you go back to the top of the truck .
we don &apos;t want it to be like this image .
she took a lot of beers , and her family members of the night .
what we did , it was with them , and they found their interest and difficulty .
and that &apos;s how we can put it into the table .
and the beauty of sustainability is that you have to maintain it .
yes , they &apos;re almost all pictures of almost everybody , but this is a small minority .
and in the sound , we can go back to the position of the  UNK  when we can get it when we can actually halt it .
walter  UNK  , walked into the car and drove him into his crown , and he put a cold air upside down on my face .
and the plan gave me a business .
i saw young people who were young people , they wanted to work , but they were willing to spend hours on this time , and i saw them different from their faces , and they were constantly scouring the road .
but 1995 , my mom took a letter from home to her brothers and her colleagues .
they &apos;ve seen pictures of the photographs and theaters and the  UNK  .
he wanted to know my family , my childhood , my wish and dreams .
i slam the garden and land as a canvas , and the trees and the trees that i was on canvas .
it could happen to be your daughter in your daughter , your best friend .
so we &apos;ve taken a lot of these tests in the lab .
so here &apos;s my belief , and i told people that you grow food .
this is called  UNK  .
and i was fortunate enough to this because it was the best schools of kenya in kenya , and i was very excited about this .
thank you .
and when you grow up , when you grow up , you say , you grow up , you want to win .
and of course , in africa , it &apos;s pretty good .
it was 22 years old .
in english , it &apos;s important to korea , so i have to start reading the third language -- english .
we walked into a community that doesn &apos;t take any idea of translating each other , but to interact with them .
i first got my first apartment , i had the first credit card . i had a big secret secret .
but when i went back to afghanistan and my students and i support them to support their parents , i saw the future hope , and see the change .
there are  UNK  birds on earth .
you &apos;ve tried it once , right , but you &apos;ve got -- i &apos;ve tried it , but i stopped it , because it &apos;s gone .
and what i &apos;m excited is , i see students in my school students to improve opportunities .
it &apos;s unbelievable . we &apos;re talking to zambia , and we said , &quot; look , this is easy . &quot;
and this announcement is the last year i did last year , and i &apos;ve shared emails from the people in my community , and i think , in the community , and so my colleagues have done a small toolbox , and i &apos;ve done a small toolbox , across the globe .
it &apos;s been estimated more than 5,000 over 5,000 thousand years of control , and there &apos;s the largest economy in the world , and with a lot of
so the photographer is just going to be here in a beautiful way , like dean kamen , say , &quot; okay , i want to take a picture of a walk out of walking through the window , and this is a white ball , and then there &apos;s a flip side of the front lines , and then there &apos;s a flip side of your friends , and then go back to your friends , and you look back at your friends , and you go back and forth between two and 30 seconds .
i had to make my freedom freedom to be free , and as long as soon as possible , as long as they were succeeding , and the family specializing in the north pole in the north pole .
and women are watching their kids on their wrists , and they were buried in the cold air .
most of them ended up in the same way , and it &apos;s important .
yes .
but what intrigues me is that even if it &apos;s true that even though they &apos;re not as comfortable as long as they say , it &apos;s just one thing that they &apos;re unique , but it &apos;s extraordinary .
the first day they saw two mormon , and then the next day , but the next day , they would come back and say , &quot; this thing never never done before .
over 85 percent of the casualties are men and women , and domestic violence in the long term , and in other words , in other words , in other words , in the family , it &apos;s one of the reasons why we don &apos;t want to see the violence .
i don &apos;t want it anymore .
who &apos;s going to work at that , if he &apos;s only if he &apos;s only one of these stupid words , like governor of the federal government , accepting the end of the federal government ?
you can &apos;t imagine how amazing things are going to be able to interact with the effects .
the book was published in 2009 .
now i &apos;m 22 .
food is the problem , food is also solutions .
so they went and killing animals .
actually , 10 years .
now , the whole thing .
did not pay attention to the ground , but the land had no harm ?
so my great dream is : when i grew up , i became a plane engineer by a plane .
and that &apos;s the first fact that i can tell you about domestic violence -- whether it &apos;s not about your race , your income , education , education , education , education .
now , how do i actually get this camera lab ?
we &apos;re trying to communicate with the local community .
it &apos;s the asphaltenes , the tar sands is a good material , and it &apos;s very good at the top , but it &apos;s not always , but it &apos;s like ,
no one would refuse , and luckily , none of us took our cameras .
that &apos;s what it says , &quot; listen to them . &quot;
i mean , it &apos;s a different species .
and my opponents resonated , and i gave me goose garden , and i had to get out of the garden .
there is a mirror to insert a symbol of the quran , the symbol of the quran and its  UNK  , the  UNK  and the  UNK  the the egyptians and the egyptian and the egyptian and the egyptian .
you don &apos;t even have the smartest people in the community , because they &apos;re not participating in your public .
now , remember , this whole thing is , in fact , this whole thing is going to happen at a certain amount of bleed -- which is the time of time -- but now i &apos;m going to take this video , and i &apos;m going to take you in the
and i wanted to break the pump for health .
it was 14 years old .
don &apos;t say i &apos;m sane .
and i was tired of these .
and you can see , here &apos;s an air , and it &apos;s .
now , if you take the same thing with a normal wheelchair with a normal wheelchair , it &apos;s  UNK  , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got to wait for this ?
this is the way i help other victims , and it &apos;s my final chord .
i want them to let them know that we can change their lives .
this is one of the things that i want to do today , and that &apos;s what i wanted to do .
that &apos;s why , after 10 minutes later , i decided to go to korea , and i did a new life .
thank you very much . in my language , it means , thank you very much .
but it wasn &apos;t funding .
and for every 20 minutes , i had to go back to my car and threw it in the air , and it would be better for me to sit in a car accident , and even when i was sitting in front of you , it was much better than if you were in the car .
i just want to say a word , right ?
we &apos;re always worried about the taliban .
if you &apos;re not a bug , you &apos;re not a rogue .
and at school , we used to spend a lot of time thinking about the history of the history of the world , but we never have no longer understanding of the outside world , except for fishes , korea and japan is the enemy .
they are powerful , but they &apos;re  UNK  .
politicians chose chose to  UNK  and control the literal reality of control , but in fact , the reality is changing the way to change the reality .
and what &apos;s interesting is that people who are killing people who are killed more  UNK  .
and in particular , one of those cohorts of  UNK   UNK  , on the street , next to a little baby baby , a picture of a little baby , and , picture of my mother has painted a similar picture of my home , and my grandmother , my mother , my mother , my mother , my mother , my father &apos;s painting .
because i was a kid , i could spend my hand at seven days , in my own bedroom day , i even hid my mom and my mother  UNK   UNK  , who was killed me , and i learned a lot about javascript .
her two year-old son , though , for the two different schools .
and because of the four o &apos;clock in the room , i couldn &apos;t get it .
there &apos;s enough space to transport pollutants in trucks .
when we were driving our boat at the boat , he slammed his head on our canoe .
and i had them them as a second .
recently , the new york times reported 10 million children every year as a child soldier .
why ? because they looked at the curves on the graph , and if the population continued to grow up in this pace , new york city is going to cost six million more gallons per gallon .
and that &apos;s why the e.u. fight against this title .
but &quot; after a book , &quot; published book , &quot; and a lot of publishing and a lot of people told me tell stories about what they &apos;ve learned , and what they &apos;ve learned from their lives , and they &apos;ve started their lives -- the happiest joys of life -- their families , their lives -- and the mother and the mother and the mother , like my mother , like my mother , like my life , just as much as i am .
you may be surprised by the land , if you put it on your canvas .
when he was a kid in my childhood  UNK  , we forgot that bobby finkel that reminds me , and he reminds me that we were more interested in the way that we knew about ourselves , and that it was so fascinating .
so this is a picture of my photographs with my grandmother .
i mean , some people would call him a washington d.c. , and other people who wrote george washington , who was named  UNK   UNK  .
now , superman is .
so with lasers , we can take photographs of the original picture , and that &apos;s what you see on the screen on this screen , but then we &apos;re going to take a lot of it , and so on and so forth , and so on and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and we can see that magnificent object
in fact , these kinds of times of these things seem to be , but as long as any kind of stylus in a digital projector , it &apos;s a very detailed voice analysis , and it &apos;s a very advanced machine right now , and now we can precisely accurately and other people &apos;s brain forgets .
so my team and i team , &quot; los angeles , &quot; and we &apos;ve started to grow our food forests , all the vegetables .
of course , there are people who don &apos;t interest interest , so we pay a salary to pay them for them , and they &apos;re also for a while for a minute .
he &apos;s screaming .
and i remember when i was in the taliban to remember that my life was disappointed when i was living in my own life , and i couldn &apos;t be afraid of the future .
and there was a woman guide to the pizza .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve heard about the  UNK  .
it has very good time , and it allows you to capture the orbits of light .
after the tsunami of the tsunami , he was responsible for sure the tsunami of the tsunami on the tsunami coast of the tsunami .
your money may be saved , and you &apos;re going to starve .
now i &apos;m going to show you a new interactive technique , called  UNK  , which is a technology that &apos;s going to be able
so scientists and engineers , when you solve the equation , let &apos;s say , ok ?
to change the community , you have to change the soil .
yeah . yeah , so here &apos;s the line , and you have to tell us if we have this disease .
even though it &apos;s just a good definition of the founding editor , he says , &quot;  UNK   UNK  is a guy that he says , &quot;  UNK  is a guy that he doesn &apos;t care for any good or not any good marriages for any party or not . &quot;
you should be looking at the trash -- you should see if you look at how much of the garbage trust themselves .
peter molyneux , one of the greatest tactics of medicine , a few years ago .
so what do we do with a speech basis ?
so today , it was meant to be honest with me .
i was shocked .
and we &apos;ve created a space and thinking about the space and thinking about what &apos;s going to happen when we &apos;re growing and growing .
these images are not about issues about it , but it &apos;s about people who are authentic , and as you are , i deserve it to be the same ,
thank you .
to address this problem , we think about self-assembly .
so what happens ?
we always have to talk about death and even thinking about death , but i realize that this is one of the most powerful things that we can possibly do .
his sister was like the apple apples of the golden apples , and it looked awfully sweet .
it &apos;s beautiful in the photographs that you have to do things with the paintbrush , or a little sketchy , or a little bit of , , , ,
they allow us to track , our memories and our past , is one of the only time that we &apos;re blind to us , but sometimes the first time we want to come back and forth .
and in fact , most of all of them were random .
and you can think about how long it &apos;s going to be ?
this is the asphaltenes , like i said , stone , and there &apos;s a little blobs in the middle .
we &apos;re trying to figure out how to understand the benefits of the future , and who have this incredible diversity and for them .
and it &apos;s a big noise .
UNK  sen ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  , but we &apos;ve also found some of the kids in the
let &apos;s answer the question : what is the technology ?
how about seven million bonus ?
he didn &apos;t get it , because most of the news is going to be crying .
i don &apos;t care about the wind , but we should call our government to decide , because the wind will cause to the birds .
that &apos;s 500 billion dollars .
and all of this sudden realizations : one of the most important things we &apos;ve created is that our memories .
it &apos;s not  UNK  . what we did .
this program has changed to us .
our office is not office .
but the pattern should be moving towards us .
thank you .
peter molyneux was a philosophy professor , peter  UNK  , who said , &quot; plan is actually a combination of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship . &quot;
and i realized that that was a moment in my life .
there are a lot of the reasons why it &apos;s prohibited due to the disappearance , because it &apos;s happening between kenya and the wildlife refuge in the united states , and that when people use non-lethal weapons used to deal with cow animals , and after that , they become a victim .
and it turns out , because we &apos;ve been able to close the speed of light , and we &apos;ve got some strange descriptions of einstein , and einstein can be delighted to see these images .
and then he explained to me where it was painful to me , and it was just too dangerous to me , and it was too dangerous to me .
and if these were wheeled to serve the freedom to destroy their own tomato sauce .
i wrote a dictionary in english dictionary , and it was traumatizing .
we have a long tail , very proud , in italy , a large size of zambia .
&quot; before i die , i thought i was trying to get this epiphany . &quot;
sounds crazy ?
and i said , &quot; well , of course , i don &apos;t mean , i don &apos;t need anybody to steal it .
he kept his own .
and they took me down the road , and i swam through the underside of a blade of a blade of grass .
and you can see the walking on the table , the
i feel proud .
she said she was looking at the end of the place at the end of the cold , she was nine years ago .
when you take a photograph back to the owner of its owner , it will bring enormous differences in the world .
since i &apos;ve been filming time-lapse cameras , i &apos;ve always been fascinated with the camera , but i want to share with you some 15 pictures of my most favorite pictures , and i don &apos;t have a picture of me .
this is a picture of my partner and great-grandfather .
they &apos;re just one of the time when we remember the time for 10 minutes to recall the day , and how long it &apos;s going to be changed , but it &apos;s not just change .
