i remember 11 years old , and night when i woke up , i woke up and i woke up at night .
my father &apos;s with his little radio brothers , the bbc , the bbc .
he &apos;s rarely so rarely that , because most of the pictures were frustrated with him .
&quot; taliban gave rise to the taliban . &quot;
i don &apos;t know what it means , but i can see that my father &apos;s very happy .
&quot; you can now go to school to school . he said . &quot;
i never forget that .
a real school .
six years ago , i went to afghanistan and afghanistan was a mandated in afghanistan .
so after that , five years later , i went out and i went to go to a one-room schoolhouse that was not allowed to go out there .
this is the only one of us .
we have to go on every day , and there &apos;s no way that nobody misses it .
we took a pile of junk food , and other people would think we &apos;d be shopping .
it was in school , so we had a small house in a living room .
and winter is very cold , but summer is summer .
we all know that our lives are dangerous and teachers , students and teachers .
sometimes , the schools are completely silenced , because the week are still skeptical of the taliban .
we always fear the taliban .
are we being stalked ?
they know what ?
we &apos;re scared , but we still remain hopeful .
i was fortunate enough to honor to live in a family .
my grandfather was his extraordinary extraordinary man .
he came out of afghanistan , and he had a different aspect of others , and with his daughter , forced me to go to school and my father , forced him to cut his father .
but then my mother educated became a teacher .
that &apos;s her .
she took two years ago , and it turned into a family school , a girl in college .
my father was -- his father was his first father in his family .
so he was supposed to be his father , including his father , including his daughter , despite the taliban , despite the taliban .
for him , kids don &apos;t have the risks .
in the taliban in afghanistan , i remember those years of my life , and sometimes i would be frustrated with the fear of failure .
i &apos;d like to give up , but my father gave me my father and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose your daughters . &quot;
your money could steal from your war , and you could save the world .
and the only thing you can do is to pay attention , and if we sell to pay for the pay of fees , if you pay off the fees , we don &apos;t have any money .
even if you don &apos;t want to go ? &quot;
today i 22 22 .
i grew up in war-torn the decades of decades .
and my age of this age , women in high school , less than five percent , and if i assure you , i would like to say , most people are .
and now i &apos;m a proud because of college graduates .
br : one of the best universities in the united states , in latin america , in the united states , in america , in 1960 , in the united states , when i was in 1960 , when i went back to afghanistan , i went back to afghanistan .
his pride wasn &apos;t just because i was only in college , because in my first year , in the first year , i was the first woman who was in the first year , and i was in charge of the first person in the streets .
i had trusted my family .
my dream , but they were expecting me to expect .
and that &apos;s what i became became part of the global organization of global global commons , which is an international monetary fund .
and that was the first reason for me to think , first , was that the first school was afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan
so let me get excited , and i see my students and my vision of my vision .
i see them as parents , especially , father , father , father , father , father , as father , as father , and as father , they see who they are .
for instance , this isn &apos;t true , but i can &apos;t see him . he &apos;s my father .
less than a month ago , his daughter and his daughter went back from a village in their village .
he picks up his cellphone , and he picks up his voice , if he &apos;s going to school going to school to school .
&quot; if you want to kill now , you can kill me , &quot; but he said , &quot; i won &apos;t your daughter . &quot;
so , in afghanistan , i realized that -- this is the western world in the western world -- not one of the most successful men behind us -- it &apos;s an indication of the father -- his daughter -- to understand himself , his daughter -- and it &apos;s the success of his daughter .
it &apos;s not saying that mothers are important for success .
in fact , for the daughter of their wives , they tend to be very widely , with the exception of the first , but , like in afghanistan , we have to be strong .
and under the taliban , the taliban went to school for hundreds of years -- never forget about illegal .
but today , the girl in afghanistan today is more than 300 million girls .
we have a different country in afghanistan .
and i found that when we saw the united states , we would see the change in the united states .
i have to worry about that change how long after the u.s. military .
but when i went back to afghanistan , i saw the support and encouragement and encouragement , and they encouraged them to see their communities , and then i would change the future .
and for me , afghanistan would have been a chance to be every day , and in every day , every day i read in her school , and i was reminded me .
like me , they have a lot of dreams .
thank you .
everything i could do , whether i work on this work -- i was profoundly influenced by my life in the process of young life .
from 88 -- 1977 , i looked very young , but i was very old -- but i found myself , in zambia , kenya , kenya , kenya , kenya , in 2003 , in 2003 , in 2003 .
at the time i was working in a non-governmental organization in italy .
i was fast ticking .
at the age of 21 , i think we &apos;re italian , and we are in charge of good in africa .
however , what we &apos;re doing .
so , the first project we gave me the first book of my book , book , called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; and we decided to live in zambia .
so , we brought us in the middle of the crown in venice , and in the middle of the south , of  UNK  , we  UNK  rice italian tomato sauce .
and of course , in spite of interest , in spite of interest , we asked them to pay for a few minutes for a few milliseconds .
so , the valley , the valley , the people in the valley , and , we , we . . . .
but we didn &apos;t ask them , and they just said , &quot; oh , we said , &quot; well . &quot;
&quot; in zambia , in zambia , in zambia , helping soldiers out there . &quot;
of course , africa is great .
we had a nice tomato sauce .
it &apos;s incredibly powerful . we said , &quot; yes . &quot;
when it comes to the tomato tomato sauce ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , all the  UNK  are viewed all the  UNK  .
we &apos;d say , &quot; god , the god , god !
zambia : &quot; yes , that &apos;s the reason why we don &apos;t want to live . &quot;
&quot; why do you say ? &quot;
and i thought , only when we were in turkey , but in the middle of this , i knew that americans were still ruled in the united states , the situation of the american people in the united states , and they were very proud of the country , and i was a proud project .
because , we give it the least  UNK  .
and you should look at the garbage -- all of the garbage -- we ought to be everywhere in the garbage .
you can read this book called &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  , dan  UNK  , an australian student .
this book was published in 2009 .
we &apos;ve spent the last 50 years in the west in the last two years .
i don &apos;t want to talk to you about the damage .
you read the book .
if you look at one of the african women in africa , we have a lot of damage .
we are westerners ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  , and we &apos;re talking about two people : we &apos;re not only two young men .
these are words from latin , latin superior ,  UNK  , fathers .
but there are two words .
i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , you know , i think of as children as a child , i &apos;m going to take a child . &quot;
and i mean , i &apos;m speaking to me somebody who &apos;s me with me .
and that &apos;s why india is white , and it &apos;s called the white boss .
i wrote a book called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; book , which is the author of the book called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is an economist , who said , &quot; the most important thing is , if people don &apos;t want to make it happen .
it &apos;s the first principle aid aid .
aid is the principle of humanity .
today morning , this morning , at the end of this conference on the ground , he said , &quot; we can &apos;t imagine , can you imagine a new city could be isolated . &quot;
now , 27 years ago , i decided to build on a  UNK  basis for based on my own company called  UNK  , which is called &quot; acumen fund . &quot;
so what we do is -- shut up .
when we walked into a community , we wouldn &apos;t be able to talk to each other , but citizens with each other .
our work doesn &apos;t work in offices .
we meet side-by-side with restaurants .
we don &apos;t have infrastructure infrastructure .
what we do with them is , and they discover their curiosity and interest .
the most important thing .
you can ask your customers .
but if you &apos;re not interested in any other way , what do you do ?
they &apos;re passionate about their passion , which is the most important thing .
their passion is an important foundation , which is the most important thing .
and then they help us collecting knowledge and information , because it &apos;s  UNK  , the  UNK  world .
there were people who didn &apos;t necessarily know that , but we could support the support .
so for years ago , i have a idea , and why don &apos;t we have to listen to them , not at all , but not ours ?
i tell you a secret .
the issue is a problem .
entrepreneurs don &apos;t never have access to meetings , but they &apos;re not going to tell you what they &apos;re going to spend on their money .
so there &apos;s a plan .
you don &apos;t even have the wisest community in the community because they &apos;re not involved in you .
and what we do is , we don &apos;t trust them , but we have to build a society that doesn &apos;t have to be affordable .
we have to create a new whole new .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a family that &apos;s private hospital business , and you &apos;re looking at your home office with your home kitchen , your workplace , or your home skill and your family .
i am in the state of state in  UNK  .
now , when i was reading student , you know , you know , you know , the book that i was book .
i spent the first year at the first year at night , who was running under the first house , and i had the first person to help my first mate with him , and i was able to send him back to him , and he &apos;s selling this fish , and the fishermen mend the fish that i could sell you ? &quot;
i made these five fisheries , which is not six cents per square inch at the cost of fuel , but at the cost of the united states , selling water at a very high price tag , and they said , &quot; hey , i &apos;ll give you some of these nets . &quot;
within a year , i did 27 years ago , government asked , and asked me , &quot; what are you going to do ? &quot;
how would you say -- &quot; i said , &quot; i did a tough thing . &quot;
that &apos;s what they said , &quot; listen . &quot;
so ...
we have 300 initiatives in the world .
we &apos;ve helped build a 400,000 40,000 .
the new generation of children who are doing business .
peter singer , one of the greatest  UNK  of a few years ago , a few years ago
peter van  UNK  was an entrepreneur professor at harvard , professor  UNK  : longtime  UNK  entrepreneurship : entrepreneurship entrepreneurship .
it &apos;s business plan .
now , we don &apos;t know about new zealand food , and we don &apos;t know how many other people are thinking about how to use them .
we have to learn how to give them .
we must give them their commitment , and respect commitment to their privacy , and they need to help us contextualize for them .
10,000 people in our communities , we had 200 customers .
can you imagine that there are 400 people in their communities , energized and passions , passions and enthusiasm ?
UNK  , who are you from ?
it &apos;s about entrepreneurship entrepreneurship .
so what i &apos;d like to talk about today is about the rise of openness .
when we first saw the industrial revolution in the industrial revolution -- we use the fuel fossil fuels , but overfishing -- we &apos;re conscious of the development of our development .
the fuel fuel fuel has always used one day .
UNK   UNK  .
we need to think about how we can actually live in a sustainable way , sustainable and sustainable 70 billion people , food , healthcare , transportation .
you don &apos;t have any kind of technology .
who invented this technology revolution ?
the government ?
it &apos;s entrepreneurship , they &apos;re fighting for them .
many years ago , i found a magazine article in a magazine article .
when they were talking about people who were invited to talk about how they were invited to new york city .
that was about 200 years , and they came together again for two years or new york city .
why ? because they looked at the chart on the curve , and if you go to six million people in the middle of the boat , they need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
by people getting infected .
so -- they think they &apos;re in dirty ; they &apos;re going to be in new technologies .
so what about the problem ? 40 years later , in the united states , had a car in the united number of car --  UNK  ,  UNK  .
finding new technologies , new technologies ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
for instance ,  UNK   UNK  .
however , an entrepreneur is dealing with the secrets .
first , you give them commitment .
they &apos;re not going to talk about you .
and then you get to focus on your passion services .
you tell them what they &apos;re talking about .
whether it &apos;s big companies , small businesses are going to be able to do three things : they are smart , marketing , sexy , marketing .
what is the question ?
there &apos;s no one who has ever been working at the same time , and sales .
this person doesn &apos;t exist .
it &apos;s not yet born .
we did surveys from the world ; we looked at companies , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the company , the companies , the company , the yahoo , company , yahoo , company , yahoo .
it &apos;s all owned in the world , and there is one thing : one in the world has no choice .
so now , we county  UNK  in england , and i started to teach a business professor , and we started talking about  UNK   UNK  .
&quot; i once said , &quot; no , we we use 32 times 32 times .
and when he was not just new york .
nobody has a company . nobody has no choice .
so we can build community , community in the community , we have a company in charge of background in the background , and in your workplace , you can give you a sense of what we need to do .
what can you do ?
can you go out ?
&quot; oh , i can &apos;t make it anymore . &quot;
we inspire local communities .
we have volunteers volunteers , our organizations and business organizations are ready to use our talents and resources and expertise , and we found that the local people and creativity can inspire innovation to the local community .
thank you .
five years ago , i had traveled to a place where it was going to happen .
college professor enabled me to teach the university of students to teach students to teach students to  UNK  .
i was scared .
i really was intrigued by the students who were intrigued by the brains of the brain , and as they as they were read , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and
but as a conversation with me , as i went through the middle east , it was a hole in the middle of the world , that suddenly spawned a hole in the world .
and that &apos;s what i felt when i was talking about my students and experience them , and i would like to be amazed , and i was hoping to be an unexpected experience .
i believe that the door open is the key to communicate with communicate .
in order to change our world , we need scientists from our scientists and engineers .
our engineers and scientists engineers , are the biggest problems that we face face , from the environment , and from the environment , we don &apos;t understand it , and if we don &apos;t understand it , we don &apos;t understand what it means .
but if we were engineers and engineers , we weren &apos;t going to go to the door to go to them , and we weren &apos;t going to to them ; we might not be able to communicate .
so scientists and engineers , tell us what we &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;d like to share some of these methods , and tell you how to make you sexy , sexy , sexy , sexy , sexy , sexy .
the first question is : how do we ?
tell us why you &apos;re science .
let me tell you what i &apos;m going to tell you about research , and i &apos;m going to study tell you that skeletal muscle is because of the heart of skeletal muscle tissue , you know , it &apos;s important .
and also , when you describe the scientific theory , the use of the
jargon is the idea that you &apos;re thinking .
and of course , you can say , &quot; biff the difference is not , but why is that ? &quot;
let &apos;s start with the simple idea of simplify it &apos;s understandable .
instead , as einstein said , as einstein described as simple as possible , not simply .
you don &apos;t have to change your ideas theory to you theory .
you can think of examples of examples , stories , and all sorts of examples .
and what i &apos;m going to do is show you that i don &apos;t use powerpoint presentation .
you want to make sense of the , called &quot; the ? &quot;
what was the bullet bullet bullet out there , and i could kill you .
it &apos;s tedious boring than just boring , and it &apos;s not just about our brains , and we don &apos;t do it .
and this is an example of  UNK   UNK  , which is a fantastic example of that , which is much more powerful than that , which is very special , and we even  UNK  structures that even the eiffel eiffel eiffel tower that has been designed .
here &apos;s the trick , the simple trick , the  UNK  , the , , , , , , , even familiar to , and , the , and , the , , , , , the to describe , the content , to gives us a deeper understanding of what we need to understand .
so this is the key to me that helps us to open up the keys to the keys , and finally , the science of engineering , the science and engineering .
well , because i &apos;ve taught me engineers , i &apos;ve taught me a lot of academic research verifying , i &apos;m trying to figure out what i &apos;m trying to do .
you know , you &apos;re looking at the scientific failure , you , the , divide , the content , share with you share your share , you &apos;re sharing it with you , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re passionate about .
and so scientists and engineers , when you solve this equation , and then , to say , &quot; i &apos;m saying , &quot; i &apos;m going to
thank you .
one of my favorites is written in oxford in oxford .
not only does sound sound .
and it means &quot;  UNK  politicians . &quot;
so even though it was only a newspaper of the 19th century , an austrian definition , he said , &quot;  UNK  , &quot; he said , &quot; he &apos;s not going to win any kind of mischief , or anything that he &apos;s going to win , or anything to win . &quot;
i don &apos;t understand what it means .
it &apos;s about words and words , i suppose .
but the words that language is important for politics , which is important , and all politicians are trying to understand what they are trying to control them .
for example , for example , for example , the parliament , the parliament british parliament , allowed newspapers to publish politicians in the politicians .
and it turns out that it &apos;s because this man , this man , the name of the brave man ,  UNK   UNK  , that he confessed married men .
he was thrown out in london , but he was brave , but he was brave enough courageous , and he proposed the courage to resign , and he had to win the win .
and just for the first time , we had a record for the first time in  UNK  . &quot;
a lot of people think this phrase a lot of metals .
no , it &apos;s a press bond .
but in order to make real sense of what we have to do with each other , i &apos;m going to try and encourage you to go back to the past .
there was one question that they had to face with george washington , george washington .
they don &apos;t know .
should you be a leader , why is why leaders ?
that &apos;s a debate in congress argued for a long time .
and there &apos;s a suggestion suggestion suggestion , and it seems to work .
i mean , some guy who wants to call him the  UNK  , george washington , george washington , george washington call him in washington .
there &apos;s no names .
some of you just want to call him king .
they thought it was a test , and used it over the past .
they even didn &apos;t have an idea , they were voting ; you could win an election .
you know , it &apos;s possible .
and everybody has a little  UNK  -- it &apos;s actually , for example , for about three weeks .
i had a college of old journal at the time i was on sabbatical , and there was this issue . &quot;
and the tired of tired of people were tired of the house in the senate senate .
we don &apos;t want to have the power of power in the house of the house .
they don &apos;t want him to be a case for him , or he can come up with his idea .
so they gave him one of their most mental acuity , and most of the worst , most momentous  UNK  , the title .
and this is called  UNK  title .
rodrigo  UNK  , they had no title .
so , the president of the united states .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be extremely compact , and it &apos;s extremely important as &quot;  UNK  &quot; and &quot;  UNK  &quot; . &quot;
occasionally occasionally , some districts have a little bit of their manage to manage their government finances , but it doesn &apos;t really matter what it is .
and this is why it &apos;s also about this project .
and they said , &quot; it &apos;s not , you can &apos;t . &quot;
this guy has signed a treaty with  UNK  and  UNK  .
who &apos;s going to take this seriously , if he &apos;s only going to have a big knife like the federal government , the federal government .
and then after three months later , there was no competition .
as yeats , they agree with title , but they &apos;re also saying that they &apos;re not prepared to agree with the title of the title of the title of the title of the title of the country , whether it &apos;s not a democratic party , but they &apos;re not as good as the  UNK  party .
now this story tells you something about three things .
first of all , i would love the most places , and so far i can never go anywhere on the back of the senate .
barack obama said , &quot; as president obama , right now , it &apos;s only been waiting for a long time ago .
the second thing that you can see is that when it comes to the united states -- it &apos;s -- for decades .
but the third thing is that you can also understand , and it &apos;s important to say , and i think it &apos;s important to say that tell you that the general election , which is that the president of the united states the president of the united states , the president of the the the the , the the the the and the , the the the the the the the , never heard of before , the  UNK  , does it ?
there were more than 900 nuclear warheads , and he &apos;s controlling the largest military dictatorship , and the largest economy in the world .
reality and reality is a historical title .
so the senate ended in the senate .
they get their title .
and the other thing about this thing that happens , another thing that happens , that sounds paradoxical -- -- oh , it sounds pretty weird .
but now , you know how many of you are now now ?
UNK  .
it &apos;s because they wanted to make this happen , like a copy of 5,000 guys , 5,000 guys .
so at the end of the senate , they lost their house , because they didn &apos;t feel threatened by the authorities , but they were told by the federal government .
and this is an important lesson that i think you can learn , and i want you to leave with you .
politicians use a word lexicon , and use control and gestures and reality , but reality reality , reality can change reality than reality .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m sitting with  UNK   UNK  , massachusetts , florida , at the age of 82 , when i was 13 years old , when i was 13 years old , i was an old man , an old man , a monk .
and what i did is i &apos;m wearing black trousers , brown water , and the brown horn , and i &apos;m looking at the  UNK  horn of the sun .
this is the first time i went to afghanistan .
early on , i grew up in love with a friend of mine , and on saturday , watching the drama of drama , the drama of drama and brutality , and he went to slovenia and  UNK  , and he spent a lot of time to go to afghanistan . &quot;
but this is the self .
so today i stand here in afghanistan today , in the netherlands , the netherlands , my god , and i &apos;m a politician to do with a political artist and an artist who has been working in afghanistan .
so , in afghanistan , you can make a lot of work out there , but i don &apos;t want to think about the work that i wanted to make , and i wanted to create identity that i wanted to make , and i wanted to work with this kind of fantasy that i might want to think about as a kind of fantasy to think about what it might be like to try and understand the ethics of the world .
i &apos;d like to tell him a man who was  UNK  with his beloved  UNK  singer /  UNK  and vice versa , and vice versa , he became extremely respected .
those are the chinese finance , but in the public sector , i went to indiana , and i was , i was a . this was the ,
i try to sneak out with the gang members of a gang member of the gang members .
i &apos;d like to conclude with a section of a the police , and in afghanistan in afghanistan , police officers in a police station in the police station , and in a police station in the police department , not to stop the police station , but for the police to the bribe , the police officer in the united states , and they wanted to make a choice in the united states senate .
i wanted to know what i would like to do with the idea of afghanistan in afghanistan .
the and war , with the of war , how how they built they , fashion , and , this and , the of and , , and , , and a me , with led to me a a
and i &apos;d like to think about the fact that we &apos;re standing in a very nice and  UNK  with a  UNK  with the of the to and of the the to of and of the of of to of the of the a the of the of the a save the of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the brown the the the the to the the the the the brown the of the a the of the of the the . the
but doing that , you might be  UNK  in prison .
but i had to do what i needed to do because i needed to do .
so that &apos;s my burden .
thank you .
hi , i &apos;m io tillett russell , and for a while , i used a sock model .
actually , i did 10 years .
now , i &apos;m not comfortable with this sort of ugly thing , because i &apos;m wearing this dress .
thank for me .
this is ted for the first time at ted for the first time , so i think it &apos;s very lucky .
and if there were women , i didn &apos;t come up with me , but now i &apos;m not going to go away .
and i &apos;d like to tell you that i could be able to be able to be able to change in 10 seconds .
it &apos;s not everybody .
that &apos;s not good at high heels , and not good news , but i &apos;m not going to wear them .
the worst news was i would like to get rid of it , because you would laugh at me , so when i was , i don &apos;t do anything .
you can .
so , why do i do this ?
it &apos;s a strange .
it &apos;s not like a portrait like that .
the imagery is powerful , but it &apos;s also  UNK  .
i &apos;m just six seconds in a six seconds , and in your own image .
in this photo , i actually didn &apos;t actually live in real life .
as a photographer , i was able to walk on my face with my hair .
so sure , you know , two weeks ago , except for two weeks ago , i was doing the brown thing to do with the brown appearance , and we &apos;re constantly changing the appearance of the appearance of our appearance , although the appearance of our appearance , despite the fact that our lives are impacting us .
so today , for me today , that means to be honest .
today i stand here today because i &apos;m a model model .
i &apos;m on this stage because i &apos;m an indian woman , and we have women who are women who we are .
so i &apos;m going to ask people to ask me questions about the integrity of these issues .
the first question is , how do you become a model ?
i always always say , &quot; i &apos;m found out there , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
i became really became a really good reason for my failure , and i , my my my my was your
well , in the last few words , in the definition of the 19th century , we &apos;re not only as good as the health of , , not only , we , body , , , , , , , , , , , , , , body skin , the beautiful white
this is the legacy of my heritage , and this is the legacy of my heritage .
and i know that some of you may may be aware of this view , and you might say something like  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
first of all , i want you to give you an idea of how it works with you .
but unfortunately , i have to tell you , in a 45 years old , in a 2007 in in 2007 , at tedmed , at the age of five colleagues in the same process 27 countries , and 27 percent of boys are not retired .
the next question i &apos;m often asked , &quot; i grew up when i grew up with a model ? &quot;
and my first answer is : &quot; no , i don &apos;t know , because they don &apos;t make it anymore . &quot;
but the second answer is , and i &apos;m asking questions about the question , and the little girls said , &quot; why is why ? &quot;
do you know ?
you can be the president of the united of america , or the the or the or of the the the the the the poets , the -- -- the the first , because you .
and if they &apos;re listening to them , they say , &quot; no , no , i &apos;m sorry , &quot; i &apos;m saying , &quot; when i said , &quot; my boss . &quot;
because i couldn &apos;t decide whether you could be a tedster in the united states or senator  UNK  , or an m &amp; amp ; m &amp; amp ; / em &amp; gt ;
when you grow up when you grew up growing up like a therapist , you &apos;d say you &apos;re going to win the lottery .
it can &apos;t be a model , if you don &apos;t have a model , but model doesn &apos;t have a model
and i &apos;m going to show you what i &apos;ve learned when i &apos;m a little bit about five years from  UNK  , because it &apos;s a kind of like  UNK  ,  UNK  , maybe one of the  UNK  .
so if you look at the photographer here , the light here -- like the beautiful client , the client says , &quot; i want to take a picture , and i &apos;m walking down the bottom line , and i &apos;m going to go back to the front lines of the arms , and underneath the front lines , the front lines , and the front lines , and look at the front lines , and you go back to the front lines , and then you go back to the front lines , and then you go
it looks like this .
i don &apos;t want to romanticize the middle .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
reality is , when you graduate from you , you &apos;ve been doing something else , so you can never say , if you &apos;re president , if you &apos;re the president of the united states , if you &apos;re in the united states , if you &apos;re in the united states , if you &apos;re in the united states , if you &apos;re in the united states , you &apos;ve got a 10 percent : the people you &apos;re looking at .
the next question often ask people , &quot; is they pictures pictures ? &quot;
yeah , they &apos;re photographed ; they &apos;re just a small part of it .
this is the first one i took my first prototype , and the first time i didn &apos;t wear my shoes , but i didn &apos;t have time .
and i know it &apos;s a little bit personal , but i was very young .
this is a photograph taken months ago with my grandmother .
this is the picture that day .
my friends with me .
this was taken me a couple of weeks ago in france , a couple of days ago .
this is the photograph of my team and a magazine magazine .
this is my current now .
i want you to understand that this is not my picture .
it was made by a group of researchers ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , assistant ,  UNK  and  UNK  , and they were making the movies that i didn &apos;t share .
the next question is , can you get free ? &quot;
i don &apos;t have lots of high heels that i wear high heels , but it &apos;s free of my life in the real world .
i was in cambridge ; i had a big store at a big store , and i went into a store .
when i was with me , with a friend who was driving a car driver , and i said , &quot; hey , we &apos;re just going to jump right away . &quot;
and i get these because it &apos;s not me as an instrument , but it &apos;s not me .
i lived in new york city , last year , by young japanese-americans , by 86 percent of young black and latino .
and in new york young black men and women are only 17 , so the question is , &quot; i &apos;m not sure . &quot;
what are i going to be ?
and when i spoke for this research , i found out that there were nine years ago , in the u.s. , 13 years old .
so the last question is , &quot; how does it feel ? &quot;
i guess they &apos;d expect to be overweight , and if you were a little bit of your hair , you &apos;d be happy , and you were very happy .
when we give the back , we &apos;ll give an answer .
we said , &quot; travel and travel and excitement , and it &apos;s amazing to work together . &quot;
but  UNK  , but it &apos;s half the fact that we &apos;re never going to go back and forth , and i &apos;m never going to say , &quot; i don &apos;t feel safe . &quot;
because i have to worry about every day .
if you used to think about my legs , if i get happier , i &apos;m happier , right ?
and if you look at the model , you know , because if they have their legs , they have the most beautiful legs on the most beautiful legs , but they &apos;re not the ones the safest place in the world .
so when i talk about this lecture , i &apos;m tired , i &apos;m finding a hard time to get a choice , because if i &apos;m standing on the one hand , if i say i &apos;m standing in a position , i &apos;m looking at something like this , but i &apos;m not comfortable with this thing .
but the hardest thing is the gender of journalism and journalism , because my heritage itself is one of my favorites .
but i was very happy , and i stood on the side , and stood up here , and i was , was 10 years old , , 10 20 years 20 and and years old ,
and if this talk would inspire you , i &apos;d like to give you a sense of what we would expect , and we would agree with the face of the image of the image , and our understanding of what we see is the failure of our success and failure .
thank you .
i just want to ask one thing .
don &apos;t mean i am normal .
i want to introduce you to meet my brother .
so this year , 22 years old .
he &apos;s not amused , but it &apos;s a very best way to talk about his homes .
UNK  knows what love love love .
he had a shared purpose that he loved .
he &apos;s not losing ; he doesn &apos;t mean anything else .
he had his religious belief : no , he had no choice .
when he heard about the lyrics of the lyrics as we were sitting in front of my childhood , i was reminded of my forgotten reminds reminded him , and he reminds me that we know nothing about it .
twenty years old , this year , and again , and again .
he had a great deal .
but that &apos;s the selective .
and he didn &apos;t remember me , but i remember that yesterday , i remember the first year that he had heard yesterday , and he talked about  UNK   UNK  , and we had  UNK  on the arm of my arm .
sounds ridiculous ?
but many people don &apos;t think this .
the reality is , because their mindset don &apos;t seem normal , but they &apos;re often misunderstood .
but let me give you an actual reality , even though they &apos;re not as normal as it is , but it &apos;s an extraordinary thing that they &apos;re extraordinary .
some of you may not know yet , &quot; autistic &quot; is a complicated brain of brain cells , and a brain disorder with a mental disorder in the brain .
every single one of these cases is so special , so sam dined is different .
every single year , 20 minutes is a diagnosis of diagnosis , this is a year diagnosis of diagnosis , but one of the deadliest diseases that we don &apos;t know about the disease burden , but we don &apos;t understand the disease .
i know , for the first time , &quot; autism &quot; autistic &quot; autistic &quot; , i i i , &quot; &quot; autism &quot; autism autistic &quot;
when i was three , my brother was so excited , i was excited about my new family .
and after a few months , i realized he was very different .
he &apos;s screaming screaming .
and he would like to be like other kids , as he said , i &apos;m not interested in difficulties .
and he  UNK  his way into his own world , and he uses his way to the ways of creating things , like  UNK  objects , he searches the machine , and he sees the machine in the machine , and he &apos;s eating everything .
when he grew up , he became more unique , even more special .
in spite of childhood ,  UNK  and  UNK  , there &apos;s nothing special about his life , and he suggests that he &apos;s lying around the world .
it &apos;s too simple .
i couldn &apos;t deny my home when i was home .
but then when i think about what i teach them to teach me about their personalities and love , i don &apos;t feel like that i &apos;m willing to change it . &quot;
it &apos;s normal ; it doesn &apos;t seem to be among each other .
just represent &quot; different species . &quot;
and i just want to say , &quot; sam dined for you , you don &apos;t have to recommend you &apos;re normal . &quot;
you can be extraordinary .
there &apos;s no difference between us , and each one of us is each of us , and if we &apos;re going to be honest , we &apos;re going to be completely  UNK  . &quot;
mastery and mastery and the possibility of possibility , we want to be thinking differently as others .
please don &apos;t say , &quot; i &apos;m normal . &quot;
thank you .
dr. ron  UNK  : the pictures of horror this mysterious red cross missed us , and a curious picture of the picture of a millionth of one .
but now , after 60 seconds , we can get a million times a million seconds in a million seconds , a billionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth .
so now i &apos;m going to show you a new type of technology , which is called  UNK  , which is so understandable that enables it to motion motion .
so with this technology , we can see the light we can see that the light can look at the front corner of the front lines of the corner of the face , can see , can with a camera can &apos;t see without eye sensors , we can use a lens camera , with a camera lens camera , we can face the camera challenges .
now , if i take a laser pen , and one of them is 125 miles an hour , and then i &apos;m going to try and make them a little bit different , and i &apos;m just going to try and make them a little bit bigger , and it &apos;s just a little bit like the speed of light , and it &apos;s just slightly different times faster than the bullet .
now , if you send this rubber rubber , the payload would give you an atom ?
what happens in a video game is ?
now , whole whole thing .
now , remember , this whole thing is that the entire thing about it is that it takes over 70 million people -- it &apos;s going to happen -- but now , i &apos;m going to try to get a video camera that you &apos;re going to see right now .
but coke &apos;s coke .
now , there are many things here , so let me give you one thing .
now , a beam goes into the bottles , and that &apos;s the bullet inside the column , and inside the container column .
some  UNK  came out , and so on the table , you saw these waves .
a lot of people ended up around the bottle caps and swirl around .
and you see , it &apos;s an air , and it &apos;s coming in .
and at the same time scales , on the table , because at the top at the top , because you can see that it ends up at the bottom , and then after the bottom , you see the reflection .
now , if you take a handful of rabid footage and magnify the video , the video is slightly different times , you know , you &apos;re going to get to see how long can you see it ?
one day , week ?
and of course , it &apos;s pretty boring slow motion .
but there &apos;s some paintings to life ?
and you can see that the dim on the background counter , the background .
it was like a brick wall .
and i thought , &quot; this is how the nature of building is the  UNK  , which is , of course ,  UNK  , of course , but we &apos;re looking at the  UNK  of our eyes .
but if you look at the tomato here , you &apos;ll notice that when you walk across the height , you &apos;ll notice that when you walk through the tomatoes , you know , it doesn &apos;t look like it .
why ? because you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , this is an artificial  UNK  and a half of it .
so , in the future of the the the the your camera , your smartphone you , you , cereal you , check it if you don
so , my team at mit , how do mit make this camera ?
now , as a photographer , as you know , if you want want to want to have a little light , you just have a little bit shorter , little shorter times less than a million times faster , so you don &apos;t get any time .
so , what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;ve been combining these hundred times , and hundreds of times , lots lots and lots of video games each other , and then we &apos;ll see the one that we &apos;re seeing on a planet , and you &apos;ll see a picture of the
and we combined all this information , but it was interesting .
now , they can .
some other heroes can be invisible , but imagine a future where the audience can see his eyes .
so that &apos;s how we can pull it up .
these luminous light will reflect into the room and go back into the door , and then enter into the door , and then we can use this light .
this is not true .
on the left , you see , we &apos;re in  UNK  imaging .
behind the wall behind a wall , we have a flip side .
so , we had this paper written in nature , and it was submitted to nature , and then it turns out that animated animation .
so we &apos;re going to launch a bullet , and they &apos;re going to come back , because this light is going to go through the light , and it &apos;s going to go through some of the light , and we &apos;ll end up the floor , and we end up on the flip side , and it turns out that there &apos;s some light left behind the doors , and it &apos;s going to be able to get away from the camera , but it ends up a little bit further .
but because we have one so that we can do so fast , camera , camera , camera camera , and we have camera cameras .
it &apos;s pretty good at the time , and , and catch the world at speeds .
so , we not only know that camera is far away from the distance , but realizing that distance is far away from the distance , but we don &apos;t know where distance .
but through the laser , we can record a picture , and , you can see the , , , , and , , , , , , we and , and , and , and , we and , and , see see see objects , and , and we and see see objects hidden objects , right ?
can we see the laser ?
that &apos;s our model .
music . now , we &apos;re going to apply them to our lives , but in the future , we can use these cars , and in the future , we can can can see the can and the see the can , can we see the can and see the us see the and can see the us see the that we can can see , and we can see that can see , and we can see that can see , and we can see that can see , and we can can look at our bodies
but of course , of course , because of that interest rates of interest and behavior , and it &apos;s very hard time for us , so we call the  UNK  of  UNK  , which is a real problem .
now , dr. love is a scientist , a scientist , science , a science , art , , , , , , , , i i , every time up time , data and , not only , , but , , the , , , , , the , , , , the , , , . the , , recording and the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , the , , , ,
but something interesting happened .
and when you look at those waves , they &apos;re away from us .
but these spheres should be moving .
what &apos;s happening ?
and it turns out , because we &apos;re getting closer to something like that , some of these phenomena , some of us , some of the odd things we see .
events were shot in the sequence of times , and so forth , sometimes , through the lens , and so forth through space , we can manipulate the envelope .
so whether it &apos;s seen , or whether it &apos;s going to be more or less or less , or we &apos;re going to be a new invention , and since we &apos;ve been designing all the details , we &apos;ve got all the details , and we &apos;ve got to think about it -- and we need to think about it -- and we need to think about it .
it &apos;s pretty much . thank you .
this is where i live in kenya , kenya in kenya .
when i was behind the father of my father cattle in nairobi , in nairobi , that &apos;s the national park .
nairobi : the national park in the netherlands that doesn &apos;t need to be in wildlife refuge like the wildlife refuge in the wildlife refuge in the wild .
so for instance , this is what they look like this . they &apos;re doing this .
they killed us .
that &apos;s one of the night of a night of night , and i woke up in the night morning , and i woke up and found that i woke up in the morning , and i found only the only because i was in the
we are the people who believe us are with us to our homes and our homes and protect them from us , and that &apos;s why we are so happy .
so i became really confused .
they &apos;re all loyal to protect our family members , but they were frustrated with the same problem .
so they decided to kill lions .
this is their  UNK  in singapore .
i &apos;d like to think about nairobi , nairobi , less than the  UNK  .
at the age of six , seven , nine years old boy , and the height of his father &apos;s supposed to be responsible for his father &apos;s career .
so i had to find a solution to solve .
and i thought that was the first way to use that fire , because i knew i was scared of fire .
but then i realized that this didn &apos;t work , but also to help us to see a lion .
but i didn &apos;t give up , i didn &apos;t give up .
so there &apos;s the second way : use it .
i wanted to make them  UNK  , and i stand up beside me .
but it was very smart .
they went back to the first day , and then they came back , and they came back to the next day , but they came up with the next day , and they said , &quot; he said , stay there .
so they killed them .
and one evening , i had a night and i would walk around the night , and night , and no one evening .
and i started to realize that the fear is going to move .
so i had a idea .
because i was a kid , i could just shoot all my day , and in my room , in my room , i even had cornered my mom , even though my mother drank my brother , even though my mother drank , and i learned that even though i learned a little bit about my brother , even though i learned a little bit about my brother , and i learned a lot about it , and i learned a lot more about it .
so i found a battery in the old  UNK  , which is an old lady coming from the ground .
and at the same time , i found a light switch on light switches .
the lightbulbs came from a big deal .
everything is ready .
and as you can see , solar cell phone , a battery battery processor battery to battery , called called a battery , called called &quot; the battery . &quot; . battery battery . &quot;
that &apos;s a hint of light .
you can see , this light is the lion , because lions is coming from the hull .
when when the hunt comes closer to the equator .
this light was a light saber that allowed me to be walking over and over , and i was walking around nearby , but in fact , i was living in my bed .
thank you .
and i spent two years ago with this antenna , and then we had never been a lion .
my neighbors have heard about that .
one of them is one of the grandmothers .
she was thrown out of a hunting pack , and she asked me if i could give her the lights in her house .
i &apos;m  UNK  .
i had these lights on the lights , and you can see behind this .
and so far , my family has been devoted to our family in our communities ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
now , the way i &apos;ve been approached by this camel is being used to protect everyone else in the animal kingdom , like the bird of the hyena , the harpy eagle , and the elephants away from the human elephant .
and i was fortunate enough to have a fortunate invention at the university of kenya , and this was the best school in kenya .
i attended new school now , and help me raise money and raise money .
i even took my friends back to my community , and they didn &apos;t have access to their homes in their homes .
one year ago , a year ago , i just found a big dinosaur guy in the tropics , and i would look at night , and i was flying around the plane , and i told him , i was going to fly around .
today , i did .
i get a chance to get a ted prize for my first time .
so i was great , and when i grew up , i was a pilot pilot and a pilot .
i hate the  UNK  , but now , because now i saved my father , and finally , we had the lions and lions and lions and lions .
thank you very much .
chris anderson , you don &apos;t hear stories like this .
so you &apos;ve got this guy richard .
did you make another apple automobile ?
what do you next plan ?
groucho : &quot; yes , i want to make electric electricity . &quot;
chanting : i know electric electricity , but i just wanted to do that .
you &apos;ve attempted it , but right , but -- you know , i &apos;ve had just before , but i tried to do it , because i stopped .
it &apos;s a  UNK   UNK  . richard saul wurman .
we &apos;re going to grow every aspect of your friends .
thank you very much . thanks .
i live in los angeles .
this was idle los angeles : hotel ,  UNK  restaurants .
so the urban planners , they &apos;d like to talk about los angeles , and think about what this means is los angeles , which means they need to change it , so it &apos;s going to change the way they &apos;re going to do it .
this is los angeles .
hotel restaurants ,  UNK  , restaurants .
and if you look at automobiles , you know , i live in the middle of desert , and in the middle of food , in los angeles , a business model in l.a.
but what &apos;s interesting is that people who have more flying buttress .
in los angeles , people died in cancer .
so , for example , my neighborhood , the rate of 50 percent higher than our neighborhood , 10 times more than 10 times higher , eight times times fainter .
i &apos;m tired of reality .
and at the same time , if i think about it , if you don &apos;t have any food , what if you feel that if you &apos;re looking at your house , if you look at your homes , if you &apos;re looking at your food system , where you look at your food system , what &apos;s your interactions ?
i saw cars as a wheelchair .
i see the same kind of center like like  UNK  .
i don &apos;t think so .
and i think that question is hidden in the problem .
the problem is food , food solution food .
add  UNK  , and i &apos;m tired of the 45 minutes minutes of my old , apple
so what i do is , my house is my food in my forest .
it &apos;s called interval bay .
150 feet 10 feet .
the government would be all the government .
but people need to maintain it .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s great ! i must , i must do what i do . &quot;
this is why i maintain it .
and so my team and my team , &quot; i grew up planting trees , and we gathered together planting trees to grow food , and then nine trees .
we &apos;re an anonymous , a free trade organization , from all over the world , from all of these different volunteers .
the garden garden is beautiful .
but very soon somebody had complained about it .
governments accused me , and i said to me , i had to put my garden out of my garden .
and i thought , &quot; what &apos;s really ?
instead of making a lot of land , and before he ate this piece of pizza ? no one cared .
and then i thought , &quot; cool . &quot;
because this didn &apos;t happen .
so in los angeles times , los angeles  UNK  wrote a story about it , and it was about a member of a party and a member of the national protection , and a member of the organized association , and they went through it .
we use our hands with our hands .
and even before , he agreed to express how attractive and admired what he admired us to do .
i mean , of course , how do they do that ?
the average number of los angeles is in the u.s.
it &apos;s 26 .
that &apos;s the central park .
there &apos;s enough to have a million cubic feet of  UNK  to a
why don &apos;t they feel like this ?
a tree produces a tree , and even 10,000 .
it &apos;s about 75 dollars a year and 75 dollars .
that &apos;s my belief , and i told people that people would grow your food .
it yourself as food as food .
now , l.a. was in los angeles .
i grew up , where i grew up with my son .
and i refused to become part of others , and i &apos;m going to try to create reality .
see , i &apos;m an artist .
that &apos;s my job , and i built graffiti art .
it was like  UNK  graffiti artists , and they were forced me .
i took a garden and as a canvas , and trees and trees and trees , and trees and trees , and trees and trees , and on the streets of the trees .
you might be amazed by what you could do , if you think of it as a canvas .
you can &apos;t imagine how you think of , sunflowers , and how does it make a difference .
what will happen ?
and i saw the creation of my education and became a tool , and i reform tools .
to change communities , you have to change soil .
we &apos;re soil soil .
you &apos;ll be shocked how to affect children .
the movement is the most important aspect of the health of the health activities in the activities of activities , especially in the inner city .
add propriety for you .
i remember once a daughter , one night , and at night , when i was 10 years old at night -- i didn &apos;t know -- i didn &apos;t know , when i was in the night -- i saw them , and when they saw me , they were very embarrassed .
they didn &apos;t make me feel bad , and i told you that they didn &apos;t like food .
this is the main street .
so when i see people around me , i &apos;m looking at wheelchairs , and i feel that i &apos;m doing it for a lot of time .
and i said , &quot; yes , of course , i &apos;m not sure , it &apos;s not .
and that &apos;s why why it &apos;s in the street .
and that &apos;s what i want .
and i wanted people to , but it was also , and i would like to be able to
and again , when i was in los angeles in los angeles garden .
these guys help me too close .
and that &apos;s cool , they share their story about how they work with their garden and their grandmother and their mother and their neighbors , and as they can see , they can really transform their lives .
green organizations are starting to think about 20 .
we &apos;ve had about 500,000 people to join us , and they are all volunteers .
if kids grow these kids , they &apos;re eating chips .
and if they grow their tomato sauce .
but when these kids don &apos;t appear in front of them , if they don &apos;t seem to be aware of their food , and how they &apos;re responding to the blind person who are just waiting for their bodies to be associated with their bodies .
and i saw people who wanted to work , but they were willing to spend so much time that they &apos;re looking for each other , and i see them differently , and they &apos;ve always been walking along the road .
when i was in charge , i found an opportunity to train these kids in their communities , and they live on a sustainable basis .
when we do that , who knows we are .
and you put george under george washington .
but if we don &apos;t change soil , we &apos;re never going to do it .
this led me to do this .
i &apos;d like to get a whole bunch of food that i would like to share with this neighborhood .
i &apos;d like to fix the container in charge .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
and i don &apos;t think about free , free is free for free .
and the sustainability thing about sustainability is that you must have it .
ladies and gentlemen , let me get people to get away from our kids , to get to know their food , their homes , their homes and food .
so what i &apos;d like to do is to get this plan to get more attractive .
i wanted to swap our global environment , and a rogue rogue trader .
we &apos;re going to be a rogue rogue .
if you &apos;re not an inexperienced , you &apos;re not a rogue trader .
groucho marx &apos;s a rogue ?
let &apos;s make a choice .
basically , if i want you to meet , if you want to sitting on a chair that i don &apos;t want to talk about .
and if i meet , i would like to take this garden , let &apos;s say something like this .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
in 2011 , three months ago , i was  UNK  in new york city .
we  UNK  .
we &apos;re going to be dark , black white house , , in , the sun sun sunshine to diffuse .
we had a very modest model , model , perfect , perfect , , better than ever , , , could we , , we , we , we , we , images we and , , artist
on march three , 2011 , as many other people in the world , i see it in japan .
after soon , i volunteers volunteers volunteers , volunteers , volunteer team at the end of the stadium , and within a few days , within a few days , within a few days .
i was working with each other , and i didn &apos;t know , and so we couldn &apos;t afford to volunteer .
on the march , october 14th , i came to japan and japan .
it was a very small group of japanese japan , which was about 100,000 people , and it was about 100,000 people .
it was the highest temperature of dublin , 24  UNK  , 24 hours .
you can imagine , this little town .
we were  UNK  and  UNK  and ate pile of rubble .
we helped build instruments and  UNK  homes , cleaned up cleaned up .
we cleaned up a lot of fish ,  UNK  fish ,  UNK  fish , local fish , local fish .
we &apos;re going to be
and week after all , weeks and all the people who were able to find all sorts of things like this .
they explored the photos , they photos and photos ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
everyone &apos;s reacting and act .
they took these pictures and put them together , send them to  UNK  .
now until now , i realized that , i lost the photos of these missing men .
when they had a tsunami attack , when they were looking for a whole thing , they &apos;re looking for everything , and everything else , they threw everything .
the last week i was in october japan , and i found myself in the last couple of days .
it could help prevent a huge problem .
it just happened to be photographed at the local center of the center of the center .
people took their photos to take the photo , and then they took me , and i ended up being able to share their photos , and i was very , very , very , very .
and those people who really touched me , it was also inspired by me , and i kept saying , &quot; well , you know , you know , you know , you know , i didn &apos;t know what happened .
and when i look at the pictures , there are over over over over over over there , over there , over the last 50 years , there are still ahead of them in the lab , and in my lab , i might be thinking about it in a picture of the envelope , and i might be able to help them repair the picture of the repair of the victims and assemble themselves , and i will utilize these pictures .
so , when i went on facebook , i went up to my facebook page and friends invited friends , and they didn &apos;t come up with the morning , and the next morning , and said , &quot; yes , i should say , &quot; yes , we ought to love . &quot;
so we started  UNK  .
this is the first one .
it doesn &apos;t have to be too volatile , but it &apos;s not intimidating to be photographed by a little girl in the face of the little girl .
otherwise , this little girl face doesn &apos;t seem like the face of her face , and she looks like a tragedy , and it ruins the picture .
so over time , we need to repair more photos and more and more and more and more and more and more photos , and so i spent hundreds of thousands of photos on the streets of the project , and i only cared for about 12 dozen people who are willing to participate in 12 countries .
two weeks later , i received two volunteers .
now , in july , in japan , in japan , we &apos;ve just had a slightly different set of feet in northern ireland .
and every week , we all cited our kids in the scanner , send the photos to their photos .
sometimes , a few of those women who had never met her , they found their photo , and they took pictures of weeks , and they took pictures and send them to the photos , and then we uploaded them to be able to put it in the cloud , and maybe uploading the photos of a japanese or a stranger , or someone else &apos;s going to be sent back to the other .
however , at the time , they returned to these pictures , and they took the picture , and , of course , , of course , , depending on .
maybe it could be a 24-hour repair , a couple weeks weeks .
and even more months .
and in this beautiful image , it has to be solved by  UNK  , and by the way , through the process ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  sticks into the water .
the whole process is .
and all of the photos that were triggered by hurricane sandy water .
and if these pictures are not clean , but we can &apos;t fix it , repair them , and repair them .
our work is very busy .
they had a woman , and we have a grandmother .
these pictures are easy easy .
as the guy who said to him , it was like tattoos to tattoo .
you don &apos;t have any results , otherwise would be a mess .
this lady shows us these pictures , ladies and gentlemen .
she also started herself to himself , until she realized she realized she had her pictures of her seeded to her .
now , she had a picture of her .
otherwise , in her face , she doesn &apos;t have her face ; she can &apos;t fully fix it , so we can integrate all of these pictures , and then we put it in a picture of it .
when she photographed this picture , we share a picture of the photos behind us .
she took pictures of her husband , and she found found out of her colleagues , and found the tide that it was discovered , and it turns out that it was very far from the ground .
the tsunami after the tsunami , he was trying to make sure that they were to shut down .
alarm clock , he had to go to the front lines .
she had two sons , even though she had gotten two school in school .
one of the kids in the tsunami are the
she took a week for a week after week after week after week after the week , and they had them .
and she came back to the day after the ninth of the ninth , she was 14 years old .
it was devastating , even though it was a devastating effect , and the devastating picture of the was the gift of his son , and , he he he he he he he he he he , , life , , , he , , , he , , his
in october june , a group of six weeks , volunteers volunteer , volunteers , volunteer , volunteers , volunteer , help volunteer contributors to help us .
most of the people returned back to those who returned back to those who returned back to the back , and it matters .
the global voices helped me get more than 90 percent of our families and returned to the photos of the family .
and during that time , we don &apos;t register material for materials , for most of the printer .
we often take pictures .
this is a reminder of reminds us , some of us reminds us , some of us , some place , somewhere , somewhere , somewhere , somewhere .
they help us record and memories of our distant memories , and it &apos;s the most exciting moment , and when we are  UNK  , sometimes we &apos;re going to miss the first thing .
that &apos;s the totality of project , for humanity , to recover from the human family .
and so this is a picture of the owner brought back , and it brought back into a tremendous amount of water for a hundred years old .
this project also brought us to a lot of change .
some of them had to be connected with this kind of connection to me , a little bit more positive , for example , social , for example , not only the ones and the ones and the ones .
and i &apos;d like to give you an interview with an email , and i came up with six months earlier , and i came home from japan .
&quot; when i feel these photos , i think of one of the photos of the photos and everyone in the photos .
and one of them is accompanied by a lady who appears to visit the grandmother , a little girl , a little girl , a young girl , because she had a picture of her son , because i had a picture of my mother , my grandmother , my grandmother , my mother and my father , my mother and my daughter , my mother and my mother , my mother , my mother and my mother , my mother , my mother , my mother , my mother , my mother and my daughter , my mother
throughout the world , age boundaries , we have the basic needs of the most fundamental needs , right ?
thank you .
today , i &apos;d like to talk about a disturbing problem , and the answer to the question .
what i &apos;m going to talk about is domestic violence , and i &apos;m going to ask questions questions about domestic violence , and she &apos;s got a question : &quot; why is domestic violence ? &quot;
&quot; how could we live with her life ? &quot;
now , i &apos;m not a social strategist , social strategist , the domestic violence .
i just have a personal woman to talk about women .
i was 22 at 22 years old , graduated from graduate school .
i moved to new york , and i started my first magazine publisher  UNK  and  UNK  .
i had my own first version of my house .
so this is the secret of my soul , and i think it was a man who hung up with me holding my hands , and it was too many times , and i was too numerous .
and this one of my favorite friends , pointed points , i pointed to the point of view , and i would kill you , i didn &apos;t know how many i had to do .
now , let me tell you a &quot; crazy love story , &quot; which is a love of a love of , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a , a and a , a and a
maybe it &apos;s happening in your life .
i don &apos;t look like overweight like domestic violence .
i had a college degree at harvard university , a  UNK  degree in education .
most of the time , most time in fortune fortune fortune fortune cookies , including the washington post office .
i married my husband married , 20 years ago , three years old .
UNK   UNK  , black swan  UNK  , van  UNK  .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to tell you about : domestic violence , the likelihood of domestic violence , the genocide , race , income and income .
it &apos;s everywhere .
i &apos;d like to talk about the fact , as many people who think , domestic violence is domestic violence , women should be women .
nope .
over 85 percent of women who are abusive , and sexual violence , sexual violence and sexual activity , in other situations , in other situations , in other situations , in other words , in other words , is that the most hopeful thing we don &apos;t expect .
i thought it was only one of my older people on the planet , but i was still at the age of man , but in fact , i was a very high-risk age .
i was 22 years old when i was 13 years old , age 12 years old , compared to the age of 12 years old than any other woman .
i &apos;m a typical victim , which is a domestic violence , because my father and domestic violence and mine .
i met a hot day in january , and i was january days , days .
so we &apos;re sitting in new york , and he sits on the subway , and i talk to him .
he told me two things .
the first is he graduated from school , and in school , he &apos;s got a great wall street .
but first , i first met him as a geologist of humor , and humor , as he looked like him .
his sidekick is like a big fat ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
at the first time , one of the most smart things that are smart , and i believe that this is one of my favorites .
and especially when i first started him , i think him , i &apos;m him
and as we started , he loved me , like , like my peers , harvard , my career , my career , my career , my career , my career , my job .
and he wants to know , my family , my childhood , my wish and dreams .
and as a journalist , i found myself as a woman , and as a woman before a woman , i had never met before .
through his secrets through his secrets , we were able to see him in the atmosphere , and he was telling me that he was four years old , and he started with his career , and then he started his career with his career as a result of his career , and he had been devoted to the fact that he had been devoted to success .
and so that &apos;s why the university of the university of state university , the plans , the plans between the future and the future of his .
if somebody said to me , it was smart , &quot; and humor , i loved one day , and then i would like to say , &quot; how can i make a speech , i can relax and make a lot of friendships , and then i &apos;ll be able to live in a position and a little bit of my life , and i &apos;m wearing sunglasses , and you know , i &apos;m wearing sunglasses and angry , because i &apos;m not going to kill you .
i didn &apos;t know that was the victims of the victims of violence and the victims of violence .
i don &apos;t know ; i &apos;m victims .
that &apos;s not home , and i &apos;m going to announce that &quot; hey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but i &apos;m going to you , and you you you you you you you , you you you you you you you you you and you you , you you you you and you you you your to your . your neighbors , you you your neighbors , your neighbors neighbors you , your neighbors you
so the truth is that he &apos;s going to go back to visit his home and he quit his job , and he quit his job job , and he quit his job , and he said , he said , he had to quit me , and he said he had to quit my city , and he moved to the city , and he moved out of the city , and he moved out of the city , and he moved out of the city , and he moved beyond the city , the city of the
at the time , i didn &apos;t want to leave my new job , and i loved my job , but i wanted to leave my soul , so i decided to quit my job .
i thought i &apos;d love a crazy love , and i don &apos;t know what i &apos;ve learned , and i &apos;ve walked into the inner city , and with your body
domestic violence is followed by violence , and vice versa .
this was the gun .
we just moved to town , new england town , and i think it should be safe -- and he &apos;s got a gun .
you put it in a car .
you put a bed under your bed under your boots .
he said that when he was a young child , he needed a gun .
let &apos;s move away from him .
the gun was a gun that was obvious to me , even though he couldn &apos;t verify the gun , and i couldn &apos;t stand up the gun , and i couldn &apos;t stand up .
for the first time i was at weddings , i was five days ago .
that &apos;s seven o &apos;clock in the morning , i &apos;m wearing pants .
i was working with computers , and i wanted to work with  UNK  , and when i was angry , i was angry with my hands , with my hands , my hands , and i couldn &apos;t get rid of the neck behind my neck .
after five days , 10 days after five ribs 10 , my wife , i was wearing a wedding dress , and my mother dress married .
and even though it happened , i believe we &apos;ll be happy , because our lives are so malleable .
and he did that deeply deeply deeply .
he was just a stress for weddings , and at the end of the weddings of marriage , my family was getting ready for me .
this is an accident . he won &apos;t hurt me anymore .
and during that time , i was detained twice .
for the first time , i went to find out the secret for the beach , and i sat down on the front door , and i pushed the door to the door , and so on the front door , i hit the car into the door .
UNK  , and drove drove up on his car and drove him up to him , and he threw a big thing on my face .
in my two years four years of marriage , i spent two times a week once every year .
i used only one of those people who have existed .
in fact , among the three women in the united states had a potential target , or as a potential target , or a report that was reported with 100,000 deaths per year .
so in fact , i &apos;m not .
go back to my question : why am i going to stay ?
the answer is simple .
i didn &apos;t know that i was abused .
and he picks up the load of the gun my gun , pointed me out of the gun , and i cornered our wounded warriors , and i &apos;m wearing the stairs , and on the stairs , i &apos;m trying to get rid of my car keys .
and it was so hard , i was a woman with high pressures with high pressures , and i was the only woman who was the only person in the world , and i was the only person who helped me to live in a world .
you want to ask another question , why don &apos;t leave her leave ?
i don &apos;t have a lot of
for me , this was asked me to ask the question of my suffering and me , and you can &apos;t understand either , but we are victims who are victims .
because in her domestic violence , kill her .
over 70 percent of the murder of the murder rate of violence is a tragedy , and after she &apos;s leaving behind , because she &apos;s leaving behind , and she &apos;s leaving .
other results may be the victims of the victims who are  UNK  , who are not waiting for the to ; the victims of the family ; the victims of the victims and the victims of the victims , the children who are dealing with their children .
now we still ask her , why not ?
and i decided to leave the final thing , and finally , i ended up gasping , and i ended up gasping .
i realized realized if i wasn &apos;t going to fight this man , i would kill him .
so i break the silence .
and i asked to everyone : the police , my friends and neighbors , but i &apos;m standing here today , because i &apos;m here to help each other .
we tended to victims of victims of the victims of the victims , the women , as the news title of the news .
&quot; why should she leave the question ? &quot;
some of them actually said , &quot; this is the  UNK  of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims .
but a book called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; and after a book , a lot of men and women and tell me what stories they want to tell their stories , and what they want to learn from them , and they want to learn something about their lives -- the pleasant life , the pleasant life , the pleasant life , and as a result of youthful lives .
in fact , i &apos;m a typical male victim , domestic violence , domestic violence .
i got married and i was married , and married men , had three children .
UNK   UNK  , black swan  UNK  , van  UNK  .
and i &apos;m never going to have a &quot; articulate &quot; , &quot; and i love my &quot; articulate . &quot;
in this case , you might wonder , wow , that &apos;s , , , , , , or , , , , , , , , , , , , in , , , , in fact , , , in , you , i . talking
and i assure you today , i &apos;m hearing some people who have been abused , or someone who had been abused or abused , or a suicide bomber or a disorder .
torture is what happens in your life , your daughter , your father , your friends , your friends .
i would end up with my own crazy shit .
i &apos;m still silence in silence .
this is the way victims of my victims , and also , i &apos;m also asking for you .
tell you today .
it &apos;s so abuse .
you can have domestic ability to stop transmission .
we need to victims every single person .
we need to understand each of those secrets .
and your kids , your friends , your family friends and neighbors , you &apos;re going to be familiar with you .
survivors survivor helped me and  UNK  myself , and have a future self .
it was discovered that the murder of the violence decreased , and decrease the likelihood of security , the victims of the victims .
let &apos;s make the bed nets , we have a family for the family to be safe and secure .
thank you .
when i was an old child , i think i would be the best part of the world .
i feel proud .
in school , we used to spend a lot of time in the history of learning , but we don &apos;t have to lot to know the outside of the world outside of the world , and know than yellowstone , american korea and korea .
even though i &apos;m imagining the world , i thought i &apos;d spent most of my life in my life , until everything changed .
when i was seven years old , i was witness for the first time , but but i realized i was very privileged to live in north korea .
my family had no patience for me .
but 1995 , my mom took a letter from her family came home with her sisters .
and it says , &quot; when you read those books , five of my favorites , i had to leave it for two weeks .
we &apos;re lying on the floor ; we &apos;re all too sick . &quot;
and i was shocked .
that was the first time i had heard about what i was hearing about .
shortly after it , when i walked through a train station , i saw the very bizarre thing .
one woman is dying in her arms , and she &apos;s holding her baby in her arms .
but people didn &apos;t help themselves , because they didn &apos;t even have their own family .
in the mid-1990s in the mid- &apos; 90s .
unfortunately , 1,100 kills 1.3 million people died of starvation .
blackouts &apos;s getting louder and louder , and when it comes to the dark , i &apos;m going to have a dark energy flowing through the black breeze , but i &apos;m flowing through the black breeze .
i often think why they don &apos;t have a lot of us .
this is a picture taken from satellite satellite , north korea and korea .
this is  UNK  , north korea and south korea .
and as you can see , this river , very , very narrow areas , very narrow areas , very narrow range .
but lots of people try to die .
sometimes i see a floating in the water .
i couldn &apos;t wait , so i couldn &apos;t leave the detail , but i was only allowed to say to the miners , but i was in the last couple of years , and my chinese , lived in the .
i thought i was just , and my family was short shorter .
but i didn &apos;t think that since i was 14 years old , we were fortunate .
in china , i grew up as a little girl as a little girl .
i &apos;m not aware of the refugees in north korea , and i &apos;m going to live my life , but i realized that it &apos;s not too dangerous .
so i always fear the fear of fear , and i &apos;m scared of a person , but i &apos;m
and one day , i had the worst nightmare , and i was police with police officers with police officers .
some of them are disappearing , so i started testing the police , and i asked chinese language , and i asked a question .
and i was very scared , and i had heart failure , and i was terrified .
if there were afternoons , i would have been locked in  UNK  .
i thought i &apos;d spent my entire life in my life , and yet i fear and anxiety and doubts .
and after another , the police said , &quot; the paper is wrong .
she &apos;s not . &quot;
and then they put me .
a chinese north koreans came to foreign foreign policy , but a lot of people were flocked to be brought to the police .
these girls are fortunate .
even though they were caught , but international supporters , they ended up being international .
but there were several uninhabited north pole .
hundreds of millions of dollars in the north plains , and they returned back to year , they returned to syria , or they were tortured to be isolated .
even though i was lucky enough , i left out of north korea , i didn &apos;t have good luck .
it &apos;s a tragic fact that the north koreans is that north koreans need to be hard to survive , just to survive .
even though they learned chinese , they find their entire world into the world .
and that &apos;s why , in october , 10 years ago , i decided to go to korea .
in korea , i was more tough , and i was more challenging .
english is important in korea , so i had to learn to the third language -- english .
moreover , i realized , korea , north korea and korea .
even though we are  UNK  , but we &apos;ve got very different signatures , because of the year .
i even went to questioning identity .
i mean , koreans koreans is korean korean korean korean ?
where am i from ?
suddenly , in my opinion , i couldn &apos;t call the national country in my country .
in spite of korea , it &apos;s not so easy .
ready to go to college .
and just soon , i started early on my new life , i received a phone call .
so , send him home , my family came home , and as punishment , i was forced to be moved to a village , moved to a rural village .
they had to get away , so i started to help them .
north koreans wants to go into the door .
to korea , across korea border to korea border to the border , so , ironically , and then i went to lisbon to china .
because my family didn &apos;t understand chinese , so i helped to help them into the 2,000 towns in china .
we were on a bus journey on a bus journey , a few days ago .
and again , we stood in a bus officer , and we stood in a car .
and he looked at his card , and asked the question .
because my family didn &apos;t understand me , i &apos;m scared to get them .
so when the officer is looking at china , i went to linkedin , and someone who has stood up with me , and he tells me , and this is my tribute to them .
and he looked at me , but he was fortunate to believe me .
so we went to all the way , but i had to spend all the light on all the way to the police .
and even though we had cornered illegal , i was still illegal in kenya .
and at the end of my life , the u.s. and the money i spent months after my family , but after a month , they returned to the capital .
that was one of the lowest moments of my life .
and for me to get my family in the family , i was able to afford to get it in jail and get home to work with a family , and prisons when it comes to jail .
i spent a lot of time working with the police department and various times , and i would try to try and drag them back and forth , but i didn &apos;t have enough money to do it .
i &apos;m  UNK  .
and then , as a man , i asked , &quot; how ? &quot;
i was so startled , and i was disturbing by strangers .
and then i had to add english to people who didn &apos;t have to explain that word for that person who didn &apos;t have to go to the atm for the rest of the electricity , and then the rest of the
and i really asked him , &quot; he said , &quot; why do you help me ? &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m not going to help him help . &quot;
&quot; i am in north korea . &quot;
and then i realized realized that was a symbolic moment .
the sacred symbol of the strangers , which i would love to meet , and he needs me to give you a sense of kindness , which is why i don &apos;t understand the international community .
ultimately , after traveling through the longest journey , i traveled to be reunited with my family , but it was just fought for war .
a lot of people and north koreans , and as they came , and when they came up with new countries , they were very low , and they didn &apos;t have money .
so we can use it through social international institutions , education , education , training .
we can also afford to bridge the elders of the world of north korea and south korea , because we &apos;re getting closer and closer to people &apos;s homes .
and i was so lucky , and in order to get a sense of wonder , so that helped me learn to help those dreams , to help me win an international opportunity to help those dreams in the world .
i believe that there will be more and more and more and more  UNK  in the world where the world is guaranteed .
thank you .
you &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;s the asphalt material , asphalt , is a nice material material , but it &apos;s not good , but it &apos;s also not always the same time , but it &apos;s raining today .
there were three water water .
and especially if you ride on a bicycle , you &apos;re not very , very nice .
and at the same time , noise produces a lot of noise .
that material is a little bit , if we want to build our city , the netherlands , the netherlands that we would like to make .
so the solution is to use the removal .
porous textile material in the netherlands , which is a small material that allows us to get water on the highway , which is easy to get rid of the water ; it doesn &apos;t fit into a car .
noise would disappear .
because there are many other noises , so  UNK  .
and of course , it has a drawback of that , and it &apos;s potentially  UNK  it .
what &apos;s the road ?
and then started , then , , more and more and more and more -- i won &apos;t demonstrate .
but they &apos;re going to damage you , you &apos;re not happy .
finally , this will lead a lot of damage .
sometimes it goes up .
ah , he &apos;s ready .
and of course , of course , will be solved , but we are solution to solutions .
here you see this material that comes out of the damage .
this is asphalt , like me , a handful of sand in the middle of the sand .
and limor ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , these  UNK  , these  UNK  , these  UNK  , this combination of these iron  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , , would , would  UNK  , would  UNK  ,  UNK  , would  UNK  it up to .
and if you &apos;re on this axis , you &apos;re going to have these  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
in order to solve this problem , we think about repair material .
and if we can fix this material , we can repair it .
we use ramps with clean air , with  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , tiny dress , we chop them up these little puck .
so now , asphalt are  UNK  .
you need more like a machine that uses -- you can use it .
motor heat , especially heating heating with steel .
so what we &apos;re trying to do is throw it out , iron ore to shell ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
you know , because it &apos;s too big , and it doesn &apos;t matter , and i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking at here .
it &apos;s the same vibrations with the same vibrations .
and i put put it in the present now , and see what happened .
this is what it looks like .
we had an industrial imaging machine in the lab .
we tested a lot of samples , lots of economists , and we decided , they said , &quot; let &apos;s make it happen . &quot;
the government has authorized by a free licensing highway , which is  UNK  meters above our 400 meters , where we &apos;re working on the materials .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done ; you see what you &apos;re doing experiments , and of course , it doesn &apos;t work for us .
we took a picture of what we took a lot of tests samples in the laboratory .
so we &apos;ve done this with a lot , which is a lot of sense we &apos;ve got to use our ultra-precise sensing and heating them , cools and cools .
we can get  UNK  .
in fact , in conclusion , this experiment is that if we &apos;re in the last four years we &apos;ve been tracking that we &apos;ve been bombarded on track our cars , we &apos;re going to double the entire road that we &apos;ve spent on the road that we &apos;ve spent on the road that we &apos;ve spent on the last four years .
so , it turns out that we made materials that uses materials that we use , using  UNK  energy , we &apos;ve got the amount of energy to increase in the lifespan of life .
would you wonder if effective .
we &apos;re looking at that .
and in fact , i &apos;m going to try to give you to to to to you to to to to to .
but try to do this .
you see , it &apos;s got .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk about a very unusual animal .
there were  UNK  on earth .
one of them is an endangered extinction .
and every time you see an hour-and-a-half like this , you &apos;re just thinking about it , you know , it &apos;s  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
i &apos;d like to think about this change , and i think think about these ugly changes , because we need them .
let me tell you why .
first of all , why would they leave us as bad ?
so charles darwin , charles darwin on the atlantic on the journey of the atlantic , found out there in turkish , and there was a few years ago , and he had a lot of the birds in the trees .
you know , it &apos;s worse than worse , and it &apos;s charles than charles darwin .
you know , charles darwin said that later , he changed the way he said to him , why i would tell you why .
so i went to see a story from walt disney -- like  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  berry .
and recently , if you look at the news story , kenya -- you know .
i &apos;m going to ask you . why ?
because they were able to maintain the natural environment .
you can &apos;t stop transmission disease .
it &apos;s almost everything .
they &apos;re extinct from far away .
and , i loved this one , so many of them were older .
there is a drop in the world .
UNK  started in the camps , traveled in venezuela , and in venezuela , and in venezuela , there were three other expeditions , and there were three times , there was a risk of extinction in asia .
so why is important important ? an extra-large cycle , an extremely important lesson .
UNK  are our  UNK  trash compactor .
they &apos;re eating their dead eating eaten meat .
they &apos;re wiped out all the bacteria and viruses , and lethal infections , infections , virus infections and radiation doses of disease and dying disease and death .
now , recently studies show that there are no survivors in  UNK  places ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  , to spread the chance to spread .
there were a lot of history .
they have contact with their eyes .
UNK   UNK  , the goddess of sun ,  UNK  and  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK   UNK  and  UNK   UNK  , and on the other egyptians egypt , egypt and egypt .
in the course of the mythology of  UNK  , the  UNK   UNK   UNK  klan , he  UNK  the 10  UNK  of from the
so in tibet , especially in the middle of the plains , the elements are important to tibet places , places that are not working with the same wood , so that there are no conditions in wood , so there are no conditions in mexico , so that there is a  UNK  system in mexico .
so what are the problem ?
kenya is eight eight of them , one of them .
many of them are abandoned because of infections , a wildlife sanctuary in a wildlife sanctuary in kenya , human beings have been brought to the erosion of  UNK  animals .
in south asia , south asia , in south asia , there were four prevalent places that were prevalent in sri lanka , and that means that 10 percent of them are going to be extinct , 10 years ago , and in 2003 , they are extinct in the presence of extinction because they &apos;re inundated with the loss of extinction because they &apos;re inundated with extinction .
it &apos;s now permanently  UNK  in england , which is banned in india , and it has been trained in india .
because there were a number of blood exploded in southern africa , and they were surrounded by dogs and farms , and they were as sparks , and as soon as the tide was flooding .
kenya is going to be in charge of the largest wind turbines : carbon dioxide fires .
i &apos;m not cutting to wind , but we need to think about the wind , because wind turbines can reduce the wind turbines .
they &apos;re just the birds .
in other parts of africa , there were no difference between  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  .
what are we doing ? we &apos;re looking at these projects , we &apos;re installing these specimens .
we &apos;re trying to find an environment in an environment , an ant relationship .
and what we find is that they &apos;re going to travel in different countries , so if you &apos;re looking at the area , it &apos;s very hard .
we need to deal with the whole government .
we &apos;re working with the local residents .
so what we &apos;re trying to do is we &apos;re trying to get the lessons from all over the world , and it &apos;s incredible , and it &apos;s amazing for them .
what can you do with that ? you can make it up to you , and you can tell you that they &apos;re going to take us away from the government .
and when you walk out of the room , you &apos;re not only in the middle class , you have to tell stories about your family , tell stories about your neighbors .
they &apos;re as elegant as charles darwin , and he said to himself , and he changed the picture , and in a way that he saw an octopus in the air , and then there was a  UNK  girl in the air .
in kenya , kenya will be great big , and if there &apos;s a tremendous amount of species in the world .
thank you very much .
we can carry around with lots and lots of ways to help us live .
we don &apos;t necessarily always have a lot of our neighbors , so even though our neighbors are sitting in front of our neighbors , neighbors , neighbors , neighbors .
so in the last couple of years , i spent a different way of talking to each other , and poetry of post-it notes , and a bunch of neighbors using these spaces that are very similar to each other .
all of these projects were i asked my question , &quot; how do you rent your neighbors ? &quot;
how are we going to be able to get away from one of our societies to avoid more proactive , and vice versa ?
how do we could share some of our souls to be destroyed by our buildings and destroyed our understanding of the landscape of our land ?
how do we express our need to move forward to see what we can expect to see our communities need to change our minds and need our dreams energized ?
i live in new orleans and i fell in love with the city .
and those who would have great , great  UNK  , i would have gotten a lot of patience , and i would love to get a lot of refuse to hate toilets , and i would love to live passionately in love with me .
when somebody &apos;s new orleans , i feel a new explorer .
in new orleans , most of the most beautiful buildings in the world , but also the most heritage sites had her own city .
i lived in this house , and i would like to think about how to be a better place in this community .
in 2009 , i lost my loved one .
her name was  UNK  , and she was like me , like her mother died , she didn &apos;t die .
and then i thought about a lot about death , and then ...
but it &apos;s hard to live in everyday life mindset .
and i think it &apos;s easy to think , but it &apos;s important to remember the day to day day .
so i wrote some solace in the building on the walls of the building that had broken out of the building , and i created a giant wall , and i went on a giant cocktail party , and i picked up on a piece of paper , and he died , and he died , and he died , and i wanted to write a piece of chalk , and i wanted to write a piece of chalk .
and i didn &apos;t know what to do this experiment with the wall , but the whole wall came across the whole wall , and someone came up with new answers .
i &apos;d like to share with you with some people on the wall .
&quot; before i die , i would like to give me a trial for trial . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i would like to cross over . &quot;
&quot; before i died , i thought i &apos;d spent millions of people standing in front of the audience . &quot;
&quot; a tree before death , &quot; tree dies . &quot;
&quot; before i died , i wanted to live a life . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i thought i was her again . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i wanna die . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i wanted to make it real . &quot;
it was supposed to be forgotten as a catalyst , a kind of quiet place , and hope , and i hope that it makes me happy , and when i was having a  UNK  experience .
it makes us not alone .
let &apos;s have a whole new understanding of your neighbors .
this led us to think about space and space , and we reminded us that change in the process of change in the process .
this instrument was my last year , and then i got some amazing messages that people were passionate about saying , &quot; people who live in this community of mine , so i &apos;ve got a side wall , so i &apos;ve got these small walls on the walls of mexico , and so on the wall of mexico , and so on .
and these signs indicate that if we will have an opportunity to express ourselves and share the opportunity to share this space with other people &apos;s public spaces .
the most valuable thing we have , is one thing , and one is another time .
in this age of age , in the age of hubris , the persistence of life and persistence of life , and life is far more important than ever before .
we &apos;re always talking about dying of death and death , but i realized that death is death .
think of dying , you have a heightened sense of consciousness .
public spaces can be better , what &apos;s important for us , whether it &apos;s true for us personally , for a whole community , to share our experiences with us , to share our experiences and help us not only to share our lives , but to help us make a better sense of our lives .
thank you .
thank you .
i was in 50 years old and 50 years old .
hot air , hot water heater , very difficult dust .
and i can feel the sensation of the people away from me , but i &apos;ve never seen anything in my dark , but i couldn &apos;t see anything else .
and i heard the sounds of gunfire around the hall , but it was more upsetting with  UNK  tools .
it &apos;s like me with a  UNK  on top of my head with a  UNK  blade of steel and a bag tied with a blade on the wall , and i wrapped up on the walls of the wall , and i wrapped up on the wall .
my hand snapped , and i thought i &apos;d seen immediately before he died .
when i stand here today to talk to you today , you know , the mines in their homes , they didn &apos;t go to work for pennies .
and i ended up the mines , and i was home that i would never be home alone .
and over the last 28 years , i &apos;ve traveled across the national football field , and i &apos;ve traveled across six continents , and 60 countries have traveled across the country , and in my country , i was privileged to visit an international peace prize .
so i met a lot of people who met , and i met an ngo that i met with a group of activists on the global development of social activist .
we spoke about it with my conscience , and i really started questioning people to realize that despite the fact that i don &apos;t know about it , but it doesn &apos;t know anything about it .
and at the end of our conversation , i feel terrible , and i feel guilty for the lack of slow , and i don &apos;t know how many of you know , but i don &apos;t know how many people don &apos;t know ?
this led me to a couple of weeks ago when i was flying in los angeles , and i went to los angeles to scotland .
so this started with my journey .
strangely , i &apos;ve been gone .
and yet , they &apos;re me as a leader of my my . second .
but once again , i &apos;m going to try to find the secrets of light .
it &apos;s more than estimated that people are over  UNK  million people around the world .
this is a slave trade in africa across africa from africa .
150 years ago , an average price of the average wage in the united states had three times three times a year ago .
that &apos;s $ 5 today .
but in the home today , the whole family would be only possible for 18 dollars .
and what was striking about 70 billion dollars worldwide .
and they &apos;re a lot of promise that are committed to  UNK  , which is  UNK   UNK  , which is a good opportunity to take care of education , and no access to the opportunity to get rid of violence .
today slavery is about creating value , but the value proposition is valued by the value proposition .
they were almost everywhere in the world , even if it was illegal to everywhere .
in india , i was brought to nepal .
and there was a kind of feeling like the twilight twilight , and the a the
at the age of 50 , women men , the whole thing , the whole thing , entire entire floor of the water floor , and out of sand , and out of sand , over the tops hundred meters out of a truck on the boat .
reuben and  UNK  and tired of them were tired of quiet floors and tired of them , and every day , they were tired of the swim .
if you don &apos;t break it , you can &apos;t drink too much water , because they don &apos;t have to have a lot of toilets .
and because there were dust dusty and dust , and i couldn &apos;t catch the camera .
and every 20 minutes , i had to go back to a lot better , and up my , and , and , and , and , i , to i , to i , to i , to , to than i
i went back to tears , and i couldn &apos;t cry when i was singing , marie  UNK  , and she said , &quot;  UNK  genug , don &apos;t cry . &quot;
and then he explained to me in my place in my place , which is a very dangerous place , not only to me , but for the workers .
i couldn &apos;t give them permission to help .
i couldn &apos;t give them anything money .
i &apos;m not a foreign citizen .
now , my behavior may be more scary .
i can only to add to the tissue system and i can trust them in their faith , and i believe they can do it .
and for me , i have to go back and try to get it out .
so , in the himalayas , i saw hundreds of millions of young kids who came up with a few miles of the road sitting on the road .
those are the kids who are climbing stairs , and they carry the kids , and they tied up with a rope , and they tie them out of cardboard .
you can see that this is incredibly painful .
how can we get these hidden gaps , but the common sense ?
some people didn &apos;t even think they were meant to be spent for hours for four hours a day , because they hadn &apos;t spent their lives .
there &apos;s no comparison .
and if they were purposely evicted for themselves , they burned all their homes .
these people were murdered , but they wanted to give up the women in the middle of the middle , and the woman who had been able to help them meet  UNK  and help them wear their  UNK  , but they &apos;re paid for themselves , but they &apos;re paid for their freedom , but they need permission .
it &apos;s the most popular phrase when we talk about the most popular industry , because i &apos;ve heard about global industry , and if i &apos;ve been seized around the world .
i &apos;m in some mines in the background .
they accompanied me with a narrow randomly narrow troupe of the sacred band of our basement .
this is not a side .
it &apos;s like a restaurant restaurant .
the balconies have been touched by the people who are forced to be loyal to them .
cynthia schneider ,  UNK  and  UNK  , are women getting married jobs , and make them happy .
it &apos;s a little bit dirty , and the walls were made from the walls and a curtain .
there &apos;s a group of people who have sex drive up to their guests .
and remember when i stood standing in a dark spot in a dark , and it was a moment that i would feel fear that i was stuck in hell .
here &apos;s one : i &apos;m walking across the stairs .
there &apos;s no .
there are no windows .
those people who hadn &apos;t been able to deal with us , we had to be  UNK  , for example , in the workplace , for example , in the workplace .
and we went home to a family restaurant and a family restaurant , and we didn &apos;t even go .
recently , recently , a new york times more than 30 million children per year .
those things happen in us , and we don &apos;t know .
the textile industry used to be used to us .
i &apos;ve spent a village in india .
this is a family portrait .
UNK  was thrown away by the hands of his father &apos;s father and blue , and those two sons were two sons .
they &apos;re  UNK  heating in the fuel , and they &apos;re deeply embedded in the fuel , until they have a lot of water molecules , and it &apos;s wrapped up with these vibrations .
translate them to tell my story .
&quot; we don &apos;t freedom , they say . &quot;
&quot; but we hope , &quot; oh god , i could get away from the rest of my room to go somewhere else . &quot;
it &apos;s estimated that 4,000 4,000 children marched into the world .
we went there , and i looked at it .
so i see the family on the family , and the older people on the boat on the boat on the boat , are a little kid , right ?
no !
kids are forced to carry up their homes in their homes , and they &apos;re working on the ground on the ground .
this boy is eight years old .
when we were close to the boat , when we captured him up , we had cornered our  UNK  on the hull of the canoe .
he would fear the water .
the trees , the container trees are often slow down , and the people are exhausted , and the victims are thrown out of the ground .
a lot of people are drowning .
and since then he started to trade out on the ground .
he was very afraid of his brutality , because he was too afraid to escape , because he was too dangerous , and he used his way to treat him .
and at the same time , at the same time , at the end of this morning , at the end of the early &apos; 40s at the end of the day in the morning , they started off in the morning .
at night , cold , night .
you know , these fish are full of fish .
i &apos;m going to introduce you to you .
he came out of a sudden .
he &apos;s met in a homeless shelter in the victims of the victims .
and he &apos;s taking pictures of glass , and he &apos;s got the good news good news for good news right now , and the good news is that it &apos;s right now , and is that we have a family where they are living and make a living living in their lives .
so there &apos;s an alternative .
so , because someone shows the impact on his life , but he &apos;s going to change his life .
drove driving along the road in ghana , with a partner with a  UNK  ride , and suddenly we accelerate our cars through our window .
he led him to him and he decides to go to a jungle .
at the end of the road , he fled out the end of our car drivers .
and he hopped at the bottom of the ground was clear , and he said , &quot; this is the road . &quot;
we took a  UNK  from the down to a lake , which was recently compared to the water .
and then went through two hours , we took the open spaces , and we had cornered on the ground , and with each of every , , , every , , every hands each ball , there are big bangs .
a lot of women working with their dirty water , they don &apos;t waste their dirty water bomb .
it &apos;s kraft gold .
these people were isolated in their shoes .
when they came out of the mine .
i remember them  UNK  72 hours in the eyes , so many of them died .
and these  UNK  were about five meters long , and they were surrounded by  UNK  bags , and they would be surrounded by gold .
rodrigo  UNK  , the man on the team , but we we found to find some areas where some kids are .
they were violent victims .
in fact , these muscle had a strong potential for lung cancer , and this guy could be treated with tuberculosis and tuberculosis .
this was his uncle when he was dead , and he was sold himself to sell his job .
after his uncle , he would continue to carry his uncle work and he purchased his job .
i met him in mine , and he was 14 years old , 14 years old looking at the photos that was 14 years old .
in addition to him , even though he had tuberculosis , even before he had to work every day .
so , he had the dream to be able to freedom throughout the country , and in such a way that help people accept the suffering of the world is suffering , and i was suffering so deeply overwhelmed with my life .
i wanted us to see these slaves .
when i photographed this with a lot of varnish , i used to translate the victims to help me to give my possessions to my possessions , and i wanted to give them the pictures that i wanted to give them the pictures that i wanted to give them up , and when i was able to shoot them , and i would give them a picture , and when they came out with me .
they know they &apos;re going to be outside .
i wanted them to make them , and we would give them the opportunity to change their lives .
and i really believe that when we &apos;re angry , it &apos;s hard to get us involved .
so these are topics , not about the people who are real , and as you are , as you are , as you are , i think , dignity , dignity and equality .
i don &apos;t don &apos;t want to be beautiful , but it &apos;s not because of the people that i
and i &apos;d like to conclude with that image of the viewer in the eye , and i &apos;m hoping that the power of hope that i &apos;m hoping to be able to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to live in the shadow of light .
thank you .
so , for me , mathematics is math for a mathematical app in terms of mathematics , which is a very difficult app for a particular problem , which is that we are dealing with these groups .
nobody knows what we are .
so i &apos;m going to give you some examples what we are doing today .
well , one of them is dance .
we dance guru dance and dance , and you &apos;re smiling , you &apos;ll be familiar with you .
now it &apos;s an extraordinary performance of expertise and expertise , and even highly adaptive optics , which is possible .
but sadly , it &apos;s disease , for instance , for instance , for instance , for instance , in the case of the nervous system , which enables me to emulate to mario with his friend , who &apos;s buff that he &apos;s coached .
and he had a tremendous treatment for many years .
however , there were  UNK  million people who have had alzheimer &apos;s disease , and they &apos;re cured without disability , and they &apos;re cured , and so we need to treat 270 symptoms , and we need to be able to target the tools that we need to have .
we need objective measurements , and when we want to try to figure out what the only way to do , is that the only way we can have access to counsel precisely when we give them a objective objective .
but frustrated , it was like alzheimer &apos;s disease and other than any other creature , so you wouldn &apos;t be able to do it for the next 20 minutes , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
you have to fund a clinic , and it cost quite a lot , and that hasn &apos;t been done before .
but what if they could fix this patient ?
and that could be the case for patients who were able to go to the hospital patients , if it was done ?
it takes to spend a lot of money .
by the way , by the way , by the way , the
so i &apos;d like to give you a unconventional approach , and we &apos;re trying to try and do that , because we &apos;re trying to do something else , because , you know , because in some sense , you know , at least , you know , i am very similar to my  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
i &apos;m here with a little  UNK  .
this is an example of someone who wants to talk to us , because we want to watch as a ballet dancer , because when we played our faces , we &apos;re going to have these instincts , these  UNK  , these are  UNK  .
and unlike the ballet , it needs to be special training .
think about how long it takes a child to take a child .
and in the sound , we can tickle the obstacle as if we can tickle the effects of the effects , as we can see if we can tickle our faces .
and you can see the bottom at the bottom of the bottom , a  UNK  disorder .
we see symptoms symptoms .
sound ,  UNK  , acute and defensive .
and you &apos;ll be relieved , more and more sounds like symptoms .
in fact , most of these people don &apos;t seem to be subtle , but when it &apos;s a microphone microphone on a digital screen recording software , using video cameras , are now available to a very advanced machine , and now we &apos;re intelligently at the very advanced , and we we the need and to a
so how are we going to have tested test against them , and how do we test them ?
neuroscientist is  UNK   UNK  , and they use existing equipment equipment .
you don &apos;t need to design a series of tests .
they &apos;re all  UNK  . they say , &quot; based on  UNK  tests .
that means that patient care .
and the speed is fast , just 30 seconds .
prices prices , we know how to do it .
and once it was cheap , it could expand expand .
so i &apos;m here to get some of the great tools .
we can reduce the issue of the patient .
they didn &apos;t go to a clinic .
we can use it to be incredibly precise data .
we have lots and lots of tissue , and we have lots of injuries , and we can show them the size of scale .
we also have an opportunity to search for this disease .
so , from beginning from the beginning of the first step in the beginning of the first step , we start with  UNK   UNK  .
and along with  UNK  and  UNK  , we &apos;re trying to get lots of data across the world to record all the data .
we can get seven billion people on the planet 7 million people 7 .
anybody has cancer or parkinson &apos;s disease , and it &apos;s noisy , and it &apos;s going to keep money on every time i &apos;m going to try and make it happen , and we &apos;re just going to be able to target .
thank you .
max is about sampling samples , and how can you tell people who are healthy , who are the ones who are healthy ?
what do you want to sample from us ?
yeah . so , this is what you &apos;re telling you , and tell us whether you &apos;re going to have this disease .
you know , some people don &apos;t have to call us .
but we &apos;ll get a lot from lots of different samples from the point of view , and the point of view is different from the environment , because we &apos;re able to eliminate those problems in which we can actually address these problems .
so now you &apos;re right now , right ?
it &apos;s far more than that .
in fact , my graduate student , i had to mention him , because he had some amazing successes , and he proved that he had some amazing successes , and now he has been able to implement these online videos , so now we &apos;ll be able to get closer to this project .
oh , okay , it &apos;s pretty cool .
so this means that people can laugh -- you can use your phone phone call , and then you get a phone number , and then you &apos;ll get the phone out there , and then they &apos;ll be able to check it out .
that &apos;s .
thank you very much .
thank you .
and since i &apos;ve been fortunate enough , since i &apos;ve ever been trying to camera , i , am today i , and i and i i i i i i i most am . of . am .
no artistic director , no , no no , no no , no , no . no .
in fact , most of them are thousands of random specimens .
my story took me out of a time in new york city , and i wore my wife in new york city , and i handed her on my face to my fifth day , and my fifth birthday .
and so after year , we went back to new york city , so we decided to take a picture of the same picture .
you can guess how to evolve .
julia daughter , weddings and births , she said , &quot; hey , why don &apos;t you go back to new york ? &quot;
it &apos;s coming up from us to help us meet us .
you know , the camera gave a completely innocent photo stranger with a rather unusual thing .
nobody misses it , and neither of us didn &apos;t have the camera .
now , we didn &apos;t know that this journey would change our lives .
for us , it becomes sacred .
this was after 9 / 11 weeks after 9 / 11 , and after 9 / 11 , i was trying to explain this cartoon after 9 / 11 .
so these pictures are far more than just a moment , but a particular journey .
and this is how we spend our time in 10 years , and day after 10 years , and year when we think about year , and year after year , and year change how it changed , but in terms of change .
because i took pictures of the same year every year , and we didn &apos;t look at her differently , and her new daughter of her eyes , and she looked at how she looked at her life , and see how she looked at her life .
this is one of the most extraordinary expectations we &apos;ve ever meet , and one year , most expectation of time .
now , recently , the journey on the road , we went down , and she suddenly pointed out and she pointed at the puppet , and she pointed at the puppet on her red track , and she said that she was a very beginning .
she gave me the same time when she was standing at the age of her , stood on a plane .
she said that when she first saw her , she had a heart , and she was nine years ago .
so she went to new york to new york , because she decided to go to new york .
and i understood : one of the most important things that we create is our memory .
so i &apos;d like to share with the conscious mind that i want to explore .
and i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s not personal , but for me , it &apos;s not the picture , but i don &apos;t have a picture of my family .
i always took a camera camera .
and i &apos;d like to invite you today to take the picture , go to the front row , don &apos;t ask , &quot; old lady , &quot; can we pick them up ? &quot;
thank you .
