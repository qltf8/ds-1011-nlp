and who could have predicted any of this ?
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
we settled in  UNK  , a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
and it had  UNK  about 20 centimeters , a species of  UNK  called  UNK   UNK  .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
and that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o  UNK  , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot;  UNK  cat ? &quot;
here &apos;s vladimir  UNK  form  UNK  in estonia .
this is bjorn  UNK  .
that means hit the ball into the  UNK  , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the runner was safe .
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this  UNK  to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
her father died soon after she was born .
i was in the desert , under the starry skies with the sufi singer  UNK  ali .
now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
i ordered some fluids to  UNK  him and asked my colleague to  UNK  him .
and their pupils would dilate , they would  UNK  , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .
but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot;  UNK  in my  UNK  . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
and every morning i hop on it .
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking  UNK  to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with  UNK  to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
huh . hang on a moment .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
but ultimately , those realities are  UNK  by suffering , abuse , degradation ,  UNK  .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
no .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
but combined , they can create something like this .
and these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
we recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low .
even cats were watching this video .
how engaged you are .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
because  UNK  like jimmy  UNK  introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
and there is this stunning silence .
but i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to admit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
it &apos;s not our burden .
i never knew him in real life .
thank you .
this is not ...
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about  UNK  .
defeat would have come too easily .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were  UNK  .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started arguing .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtuous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
and it &apos;s that  UNK  connection that i believe  UNK  us to not just be  UNK  to all the bright and  UNK  things , but also the dark and difficult things .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
there are billions of them .
and there &apos;s nothing  UNK  in the history of technology development of this kind of  UNK  growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extraneous redundant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lowering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
but what are we doing with it ?
it &apos;s not our struggle .
the bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my  UNK  and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
but today , it goes beyond that .
now i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14-year-old black male client like a privileged , white  UNK  corporate executive . &quot;
you always lose rare animals .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some beer . &quot;
and i got a big  UNK  , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and i asked the manager , &quot; is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
is it something about the light ?
we &apos;re going through the same levels that  UNK  organisms have gone through --  UNK  out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
after only one trip .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the  UNK  &apos;s .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this  UNK  of beer -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
and so over here you need to tilt your ipad , take the fireflies out .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
they had to worry about being bombed .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
they were there in february , and it  UNK  a lot in february last year .
and whenever you are in a city like  UNK  and somebody collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cellphone , to find the nearest  UNK  which can save lives .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10  UNK  cat litter products , they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
i don &apos;t believe that .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as  UNK  , which is what the product is called , but also  UNK  .
she took me out back and she said , &quot;  UNK  , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;
all the dollars were allocated and extra  UNK  in english and mathematics was  UNK  for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always  UNK  .
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
UNK  , creative participating communities , complete  UNK  , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
we have seven million people on  UNK  and  UNK  .
i was devastated .
a lot of my clients are very young .
something really weird is going on here .
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
and then we look at cases like what happened in  UNK  .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at managing those choices ?
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your ipad out with the video on and through augmented reality , you see this layer of animated  UNK  appear on a  UNK  that &apos;s outside your house .
UNK  software usually takes a couple of years .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for  UNK  it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it 10 to the 22 times .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
in fact , so lacking in confidence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs.  UNK  , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the  UNK  throat ? &quot;
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
but that &apos;s the nicest thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine aisle .
we made an application for  UNK  , augmented reality , to find these  UNK  .
he is my grandfather .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
in high school , a  UNK  once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test .
so it says , &quot; place your fingers upon each light . &quot;
back then , when  UNK  , the great indian warrior prince , when he was thirsty , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the  UNK  time scale .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . &quot;
they sell certificates .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
i represent children .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
hi . i &apos;m kevin  UNK  , i &apos;m the trends manager at youtube , and i professionally watch youtube videos .
if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz , clap your hands .
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
so scott gets this call .
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the  UNK  of your province .
in sending her home , i  UNK  a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
pretty simple .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with this .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
they sort of go like this .
and before i knew it , the  UNK  was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle  UNK  in new york city , i admit i wasn &apos;t very interested .
thank you very much .
and you make  UNK  and you never make that mistake again .
if you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
here are two different jewelry displays .
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
and i began giving her my rap .
i represent people on death row .
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
and i go to the jail and i see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult .
and now there are 10,000  UNK  of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have  UNK  us .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an  UNK  suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
this is alfred  UNK  .
we worked well into each night .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the  UNK  voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
we adjust our baseline to the new level , and we don &apos;t recall what was there .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
all the adults knew the risks .
turned  UNK  on its side . walked home .
someone made an old  UNK  version .
and then my brother started staring at me .
slowly but surely , it lifted .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleague universities , to help us to find and work and act like a hub to  UNK  all these  UNK  all around the world .
so beyond simple play ,  UNK  are actually pretty powerful .
but so many over the years were helped .
the typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
it would be  UNK  .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
the  UNK  still say it is untouched .
so what happens here ?
i spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row .
he died broken by history .
i was riding in a 747 with marvin minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a  UNK  .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a  UNK  resident .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infection , not of the throat , but of the upper  UNK  , and it can actually cause the  UNK  to close .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
you have on the y axis some good thing : biodiversity , numbers of  UNK  , the  UNK  of your country , the water supply .
there were still  UNK  .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was  UNK  people , especially if they were disproportionately jewish ?
what does this mean ?
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
and the nurse thought about it and said very  UNK  , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
three times out of 10 .
and the  UNK  staff pulled out all the stops .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
in the other , i was  UNK  in lives that were  UNK  , tragically  UNK  by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
so what was the next step ?
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
here i have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
but you know what ?
because i was there in &apos; 71 , studying a  UNK  in west africa .
twice in one emergency shift , i missed  UNK  .
good , really good , maybe an  UNK  .
so you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
i believe we need to do more to help people who are  UNK  by crime , not do less .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;all go ahead . y &apos;all go ahead . &quot;
and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
so let me recap .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
he said , &quot; oh , mama tells all the grandkids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
and it starts with one physician at a time .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things ,  UNK  . &quot;
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
an entire remix community  UNK  up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
what do you do with certificates ?
it &apos;s a  UNK  made of  UNK  that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball  UNK  ?
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours ms. parks turned to me and she said , &quot; now  UNK  , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down .
if i had really been a  UNK  , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
okay .
we love entertainment .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
so after a four-year  UNK  that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel .
rebecca black &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
so  UNK  is open-source .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not settle into a career in law .
but if i could give it and still see them safely through , i would .
they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time .
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to ted .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mrs.  UNK  , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100  UNK  of white powder , which i try not to let the security people see at airports .
and she &apos;d squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
i &apos;ve been illustrating books since i was 16 .
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed  UNK  report that &apos;s a response to the sec &apos;s request for comment on the financial reform bill .
i gave her my whole rap , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mmm mmm mmm . &quot;
yeah ,  UNK  , the judge has some magic power .
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
for a year we were penniless .
we love innovation .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . &quot;
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
vaclav  UNK  , the great  UNK  leader , talked about this .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
in one , i was the classic asian student , relentless in the demands that i made on myself .
telephony , computers ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
they had sold this tool for  UNK  euros to the egyptian government .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a  UNK   UNK   UNK  ball .
and the next morning , i woke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
and to my horror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
my state of alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently  UNK  you if you have a criminal conviction .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
so i followed my  UNK  .
there were gray whales in  UNK  bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
i tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii .
they become rarer because we fish them .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
how do i get this removed ? &quot;
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
but they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have  UNK  making ...
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .
and it &apos;s collected by my general practitioner as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need  UNK  support or something like it , but also looking backward .
now we do the same with drills and machines .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
she was back and near death .
and certainly , we could have been shoveling out those fire  UNK  all along , and many people do .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
UNK  are electronic modules with each one specific function .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
i memorized in my anatomy class the origins and  UNK  of every muscle , every branch of every artery that came off the aorta , differential diagnoses obscure and common .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
that whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collapses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
it would be  UNK  for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about  UNK  people . &quot;
the first : cut .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immunize me against making mistakes .
they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment .
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
and it opens up a map .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a  UNK  .
like here , we have mr.  UNK   UNK  from the city of kiev in ukraine .
and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice overload problem .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
so meet al .
in this country , as many as 24,000 canadians die of preventable medical errors .
now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot;
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
there &apos;s a guy in the i.t. department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
in those plans that offered nearly 60 funds , participation rates have now dropped to about the  UNK  percentile .
and despite that , it  UNK  a level of  UNK  .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it .
i think it &apos;s very  UNK  of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
it &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
hey , why not ?
and his answer was yes .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
the unhealthy shame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a  UNK  fund .
in the &apos; 70s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 60s -- europe did lots of development projects .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
in fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
storytelling is becoming more and more  UNK  .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
and so -- it says , &quot; this box belongs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
and ms. parks used to come back to  UNK  every now and then , and she would get together with two of her  UNK  friends , these older women ,  UNK   UNK  who was the organizer of the  UNK  bus  UNK  -- amazing african-american woman -- and virginia  UNK  , a white woman , whose husband ,  UNK   UNK  , represented dr. king .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .
so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death penalty in germany .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and  UNK  her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in  UNK  by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qualifications .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
and during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were in a locked case that came from  UNK  olive trees .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
my male uncles died of  UNK  diseases .
and i was shocked and  UNK  to the core .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire  UNK  .
and i was  UNK  from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a thief .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
one i thought had a kidney stone .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
the third technique :  UNK  .
came into the  UNK  and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
i was an  UNK   UNK  student .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
in my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical  UNK  and medical errors to learn everything i can , from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000  UNK  to impose on them industrial fishing .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so confusing .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
others in medicine dread them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so  UNK  .
so what happened here ?
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the  UNK  of city hall .
and you saw  UNK  &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the  UNK  program right before your eyes .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the  UNK  .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
they were still kind of happy .
thank you very much .
and i did well , i graduated with honors ,  UNK   UNK  .
and as i was walking up the steps of this  UNK  , there was an older black man who was the janitor in this  UNK  .
and this is about shifting baseline .
i was taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in melbourne .
suppose you have  UNK  and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s batting 400 on  UNK  .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
you should ask for some of that .
we &apos;re trying to end life without  UNK  sentences for children .
it &apos;s called batting average .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and to report back to my attending .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
and i thought i could blend in .
now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our  UNK  -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
these might be  UNK  services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the  UNK  that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
car colors , exterior car colors -- i &apos;ve got 56 choices .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
now we see the opposite effect .
i &apos;m going to focus on one  UNK  that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
when i say  UNK  , i mean  UNK  .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
now in the financial savings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david  UNK  was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were  UNK  .
it was not drowned yet .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
it connected those two people .
i used to love going to this store , but on one occasion i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
it &apos;s not our problem .
if you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed , that means i &apos;m losing you .
this is a highly useless  UNK  scheme .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , glued to their  UNK  , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re hanging in there .
and you &apos;d think he was chasing  UNK  , but he wasn &apos;t .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call  UNK  in your city .
you can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d assault me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a gotcha way , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody can benefit .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
something  UNK  inside me .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court .
we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
save those . kill off the rest .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
and i studied in my little  UNK  at the nurses &apos; residence at toronto general hospital , not far from here .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fox and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox today . &quot;
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
so here &apos;s another example .
he kept  UNK  back and forth .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egyptian government a set of tools for  UNK  -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
and here every piece is very well planned .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on  UNK  or  UNK  .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done historically .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little  UNK  .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of  UNK  microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an  UNK  institution , but as a problem of collective action .
very quickly concrete blocks became the  UNK  construction unit in the world .
people are always upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
we &apos;re losing them .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
these guys make money .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
we &apos;ve been giving  UNK  to kids and seeing them play with them .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
lego made it accessible .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
we asked around and nobody knew .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4,000 followers on twitter .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
my mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
and one of the things we did at  UNK  university is we appointed a chief listening officer .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african-american home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on  UNK  curves .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they  UNK  .
by being totally surprising and humorous , casey  UNK  got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor  UNK  back and forth .
this was the  UNK  grouper .
and this has spread just  UNK  , organically , naturally .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
and that was my first time to be  UNK  with that .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a  UNK  curve .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
even though choosing  UNK  doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor , it still  UNK  me for how to choose .
thank you .
one of two things is going to happen .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in literate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
i ordered a kidney x-ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a  UNK  of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so i decided to change that .
and so i jumped in , i jumped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
i would like to talk to you about why many  UNK  projects fail .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epic &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
today , there are 2.3 million .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
and i put in my motion that there was  UNK   UNK  and police  UNK  and judicial  UNK  .
they had 250 different kinds of  UNK  and  UNK  and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water .
i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
UNK  is a certificate authority from the netherlands -- or actually , it was .
and over 10,000  UNK  already in the netherlands already have been submitted .
is that all ?
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs.  UNK  .
grants and sponsors were sought .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the  UNK  tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
and they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half of their size .
but when something like this happens , things are  UNK  changing .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
when i was a child , i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and  UNK  and shells .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named erik  UNK  , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things .
UNK  ? check . living ? yep .
and that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the  UNK  health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
he types &quot;  UNK  &quot; into this official knowledge base .
this is not a finished story .
so if you look at the extremes , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the  UNK  -- still not as high as we want it to be .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and this boat , quite ugly , is called the  UNK  4 .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
they &apos;re  UNK  to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and i memorized everything .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four  UNK  , to 56 car colors , high choice .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
and on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
the second story , also to illustrate another concept , is called shifting  UNK  .
this is a simulation of  UNK  bay .
so what we did , we  UNK  the netherlands .
well it was a friday , this is true .
this is a chart of what it looked like .
and i went back to work .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
jimmy  UNK  posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
it will get to you .
so back in the day , when us indians wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a chariot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace corps for geeks .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
but there &apos;s another thing .
she had irreversible brain damage .
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the  UNK  projects fail , since we stopped listening .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
there was also recently a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole week .
and i went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and i hoped against hope that she would recover .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
UNK  ,  UNK  !
he said , &quot; mr.  UNK  , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
jimmy  UNK  actually .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
thank you .
and i thought about that .
i began to feel a bit better .
the shores are from a different location .
why should i worry ?
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
alone , ashamed and  UNK  .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get selected out .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
and similar to &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to have just  UNK  up out of nowhere .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
they will tap your internet connection .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail , in prison , on  UNK  or  UNK  .
and it was what i was feeling .
UNK  .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this  UNK  , geeky internet culture .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
and i think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
privacy is  UNK  .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile  UNK  of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
i was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto when mrs.  UNK  was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where i was working .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic  UNK  like depth of field ,  UNK  colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are  UNK  that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch  UNK  , an interactive app for the ipad .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
so to achieve a realistic result , i think it comes down to planning .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
and i went through the same period of shame and  UNK  and felt  UNK  and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
this was my first  UNK  .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the  UNK  layer on top .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was chosen as the young australian of the year .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
so how does it happen ?
i felt like anyone could do that .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; swing . &quot;
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
a big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s .
and so when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times , but were  UNK  by the  UNK  of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
three months later i had  UNK  , and the adventure has continued .
this is a dead turtle .
and that means  UNK  , it means open , it means generative .
they were maturing at five centimeters .
and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks .
on my show , on &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; i made it a habit of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from  UNK  to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about yours ? &quot; and i would point the microphone towards them .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices .
if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , clap your hands .
well there are opportunities all around us .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on  UNK  .
this is my wifi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
they had  UNK  different kinds of jam .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
now why do we draw technology curves in  UNK  curves ?
some of my  UNK  have been in the last five years .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with  UNK  as a material .
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted . &quot;
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the debris , the piles of debris , were coral reef fish .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
okay , there &apos;s some .
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
why didn &apos;t i ask my attending ? why did i send her home ?
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of dna .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
but it &apos;s not documented .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
so we &apos;re the  UNK  and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; i will bypass you . &quot;
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
we have online criminals .
it &apos;s spreading virally .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an  UNK  free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world .
there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exclusion , to  UNK  , to injustice .
oh , my god !
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
i made the decision to move to the u.s.
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into  UNK  organisms .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow  UNK  into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
it would be so  UNK  and so empowering .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy  UNK  at those giant walls of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , jams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of comparing and  UNK  and actually picking from that stunning display .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
they stopped us from being inspired .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
and let me show you a simple example .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a  UNK  brick .
so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in  UNK  with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very  UNK  to me .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem , which is  UNK  .
i do get tired , as we all do .
and we say that word with such contempt .
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a  UNK  throat .
but there are two problems with that .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you &apos;re considering their future financial well-being .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
my  UNK  again .
he retreated into silence .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re  UNK  ourselves .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total  UNK
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
now we do the same with airplanes .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
and there they make great apps , they work with city  UNK  .
my mother phoned minutes later .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best  UNK  .
but , but , you know what ?
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &quot;
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot;  UNK  , do you still feel me  UNK  you ? &quot;
so in these plans , we had about  UNK  plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings .
or is it photography ?
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
now the fish is on the iucn red list .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
and i got in my car and i went to this  UNK  .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am ,  UNK  , almost a generation older than most of them .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
and they did .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over  UNK  connections , so the local government can &apos;t  UNK  on their discussions .
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
but the point is , we still come to galapagos .
so what happened on this day ?
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated .
and that &apos;s nothing .
they &apos;re more likely to delay choosing --  UNK  even when it goes against their best self-interest .
now in fact , you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
go home to where ?
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
the three words are : do you remember ?
he was actually collecting fish .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
and that &apos;s important .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
all right .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
thank you .
it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
and what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate .
that could be shoveling out a hydrant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an  UNK  in it .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem ?
do you know what they call a 300  UNK  in major league baseball ?
we &apos;re taking off .
all right , let &apos;s go .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just skip -- i &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ...
a few weeks ago we took  UNK  to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot;
and it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult , to see that patient in  UNK  .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
there was an energy there , an  UNK  optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .
he had a potentially life-threatening condition called  UNK  .
and 90 percent of our catch were sponges , other animals that are fixed on the bottom .
and those are the neural structures .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device .
she shares her experience with others .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
at the end you want to sustain miserable  UNK  .
and every now and then ms.  UNK  would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot;  UNK  , ms. parks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be  UNK  about choosing .
and the family gathered .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
it might take a moment to load .
and if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the  UNK  story -- why so touched by the imagery ?
he was placed on  UNK  antibiotics and he recovered after a few days .
all of these techniques that i &apos;m describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving .
these poor  UNK  have been trapped inside  UNK  &apos;s chambers for thousands of years in an old and  UNK  book .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
i had written these crazy things .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
one of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the ipad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after mrs.  UNK  before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians i know dread .
the other nurse asked  UNK  .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of  UNK  .
the redefined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but  UNK  to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
you know , the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products .
if there is a  UNK  in our family , it runs through the women .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the  UNK  behind the house .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 911 and the  UNK  brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
i talk a lot about these issues .
my grandfather was in prison during  UNK  .
so the system is evolving to create  UNK  that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also  UNK  in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean .
groups like anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
instead of having to program , to wire , to  UNK  ,  UNK  allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
they put her on a  UNK  .
and so my recommendation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for cameron to do &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
well you need a certificate if you have a website that has  UNK  ,  UNK  encrypted services , services like gmail .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
so go ahead and start inventing .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
thank you .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
you can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little  UNK  .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
what does it mean ?
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
so i signed the discharge papers , and an ambulance came ,  UNK  came to take her home .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
UNK  , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
at the time i was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
now take the same patient with chest pain , make them moist and  UNK  and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath , and suddenly my history is  UNK  with contempt .
but i carried on with my work .
but where would be the nearest  UNK  to help this patient ?
we set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store .
so &quot;  UNK  cat &quot; is a  UNK  animation with  UNK  music .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
and here &apos;s the thing .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he  UNK  things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get sued .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to clap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take gary up on his offer .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
now this store , it was almost like going to an amusement park .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i &apos;m sitting here making  UNK  sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again .
in the possibilities of linking together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
otherwise , when i ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , i &apos;d like you to clap your hands .
the company headquarters are right here .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
there were remixes .
they will even use tools like state  UNK  to infect your computer with a  UNK  , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
and the more we &apos;re able to be  UNK  about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing .
we have our cognitive biases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
except they can if they hack into a foreign  UNK
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
in the 1980s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
so that &apos;s  UNK  movement has done .
at various points , a little letter drops down to me -- and the ipad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually addressed to me .
when proctor &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; shoulders to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent .
and issue rogue certificates .
and this made me really sad .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
think about your own choices .
and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows .
i never will forget it .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .
because it &apos;s in that  UNK  that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or  UNK  is supposed to bat .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
a few years ago i started developing  UNK  .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a  UNK  and opened another business .
we know perfectly where all the atms are about the city of  UNK  .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
i am a redefined physician .
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be  UNK  around race , they &apos;re also distorted by poverty .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the  UNK  .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
so every morning i hop on my wifi scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light lunch today ,  UNK  . &quot;
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot;
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book .
we &apos;ve also been taking  UNK  to design schools .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
that means that  UNK   UNK  safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
and the  UNK  was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few mangrove .
1,000 , very good .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hugs .
here &apos;s a german car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car .
but they do the job .
and the fisheries for this  UNK  sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in ghana .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
how could we help you ? &quot;
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a  UNK  curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
so a study that i did with  UNK   UNK  and alessandro  UNK  , we did a study with people at  UNK  -- employees that are all working at  UNK  -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing  UNK  for their 401 plan .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
if we were captured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
a school uniform down to the ankles , because it had to last for six years .
here &apos;s their jam aisle .
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
for example , the anecdote that some present , as captain  UNK  observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
he kept pointing here .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have  UNK  of breath .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution .
and i saw mrs.  UNK  , and she was  UNK  .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
the bricks are color-coded .
my mother ,  UNK  , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
in both cases , these are gross  UNK  , because we really aren &apos;t  UNK  out the problem as we should .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in  UNK  and sat around her  UNK  .
it &apos;s not just code for america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities .
so we &apos;ve all heard about fairies and we &apos;ve all heard about  UNK  , but how many people outside of india know about their indian counterparts , the  UNK  ?
i met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
the idea behind  UNK  is that it &apos;s a growing library .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an  UNK  , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
i gave her medications that we call  UNK  , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
wealth , not  UNK  , shapes outcomes .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and when i listened to her , she was making a  UNK  sound .
so now we &apos;ve  UNK  up the time scales once again .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
her mother raised her alone .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game .
and this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
and at that stage , we have  UNK  communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
so when i ask you a question , since i &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories .
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
we actually have several cases of millionaires online ,  UNK  , who made money with their attacks .
the categories need to say something to the  UNK  , not the  UNK  .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
two years later i was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of toronto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a  UNK  throat .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24 .
i was terrified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me , without tweeting it to my friends .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all  UNK  .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were  UNK  encouraged .
so that worked . so  UNK  for scott .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday .  UNK  &apos; down on friday . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
and he pointed to the  UNK  of tourists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
thank you .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
and i don &apos;t mean wizards and dragons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all  UNK  as children .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this  UNK  .
you can have a succession of changes .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan , the 401 plan , does that affect people &apos;s likelihood to save more for tomorrow .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us  UNK  these  UNK  .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
okay . thank you very much .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
we were poor .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
well in egypt , the  UNK   UNK  the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
and she &apos;s hitting a  UNK  .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
for example , how a  UNK  works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the  UNK  hack .
my name is brian goldman .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble .
solar technology is ...
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
and the snippets of  UNK  english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
and we built an ipad application .
and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an atm card or a credit card as opposed to cash ?
goodnight sweet  UNK  . &quot;
it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
well i went into the  UNK  .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
in another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that .
and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of  UNK  analogous to sex . &quot;
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
and because government ultimately  UNK  its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess ,  UNK  is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .
we would never do that in our own countries .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
unlike the settled middle-class suburbs , whose existence i was oblivious of , there was no sense of  UNK  in  UNK  .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
she grew up at a time when  UNK  was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category ?
and yet , there is this disconnect .
and i claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
at 17 she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
can i give them a bow in their lives ,  UNK  bravely into each wave , the  UNK  and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarantees nothing ?
it was a store called  UNK  &apos;s .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
last year , bear  UNK  posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scott  UNK  did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an  UNK  stuck in your house .
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison .
the only country in the world .
she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of  UNK  took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they &apos;re fixing it .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
it can know where we are .
no one has to  UNK  your idea .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
this is stephen watt .
because evolution could now happen within an individual .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
imagine him as the communists enter  UNK  , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
this mountain of debris is actually collected by  UNK  every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fished .
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
i will never forget it .
tan le , anonymous  UNK  resident , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
it was  UNK  to her that she would not succeed .
wooo !
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
it became a  UNK  gateway into a world full of pirates and  UNK  and images in my imagination .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file .
so half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 56 car colors , to low choice , four  UNK  .
privacy is not up for discussion .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , i have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery .
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
this is a modest little app .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
in the united states , the institute of medicine  UNK  it at 100,000 .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
so those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
it was called the automatic binding brick .
she was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
it &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called state  UNK  was found , which was a  UNK  used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
and when i listened to her chest with a stethoscope , i could hear  UNK  sounds on both sides that told me that she was in  UNK  heart failure .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
nobody knew where the nearest life-saving  UNK  was to be obtained right now .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
well she was back all right .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
we have three main groups .
i &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
this is happening to us today .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
centers were established .
and he whispered in my ear .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
we love technology . we love creativity .
here &apos;s their olive oil aisle .
and i went back to my work on the  UNK  .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 650 plans all in the u.s.
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &quot;
and i felt really good .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
we &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the  UNK  , be perfect .
it turns out that in  UNK  grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor , the magazine aisles range anywhere from  UNK  different kinds of magazines all the way up to  UNK  .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
i looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
over here , these are the  UNK  .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
okay , a bit more .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the  UNK  .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
engines ,  UNK  -- four choices .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of  UNK  will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
say , &quot; please repeat that process . &quot;
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
no had never been an option .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
three things :  UNK  , communities of participation and  UNK  .
so those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money ,  UNK  like anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
i don &apos;t know .
take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their  UNK  , and the children inherit the traits of the  UNK  of the two programs .
this is matthew anderson ,  UNK   UNK  and so on and so on .
because i have nothing to hide . &quot;
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citizen .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i hop on , it sends my data through google health as well .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical  UNK  like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
to these  UNK  ,  UNK  became another material , electronics became just another material .
if you generalize this , something like this happens .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
and then it went international .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary .
score them again .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
but it does require a lot of planning .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of  UNK  feeling inside my stomach .
what am i going to look at ?
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
so when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very  UNK  grocery store ; at least at that time it was truly  UNK  .
i sometimes push too hard .
and i went sailing on it , and we did surveys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the java sea .
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
and so i did .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african-american history , i tell them about slavery .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented .
and the more  UNK  i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the  UNK  coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
all along , all fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps have been static .
what creates the illusion ?
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
why did i go into medicine ?
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and at the end of the day , i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , froze the swiss bank account of mr. sam jain right here , and that bank account had  UNK  million u.s. dollars on it when it was frozen .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being  UNK  active .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started  UNK  out .
he is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged .
because it  UNK  something that in a sense has been lost .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
and they found that the average ceo engaged in about  UNK  tasks in a week .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
and actually i become a character in the book .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
i spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
so i spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the  UNK  .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in this  UNK  ? &quot;
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
and there were rare but searing  UNK  of &quot;  UNK  &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
well i adored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
well  UNK  picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
but the ninth largest  UNK  , the ninth biggest  UNK  in the world today is  UNK  , and it offers you only 1,400 products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce .
yet i am afraid of privilege , of ease , of  UNK  .
and then it happened again .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on ,  UNK  . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple  UNK  of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
and i have to tell you , it was  UNK  .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
and in fact , we &apos;re such a  UNK  community .
and i think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
my third little story is that i was an  UNK  in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia .
what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an  UNK  , a  UNK  is supposed to be ?
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
and he knew her , he would have been able to  UNK  additional information about her .
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by  UNK  and decades of racial  UNK  and apartheid .
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
legendary -- as in ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the comeback trail .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
in many communities , people had to worry about being  UNK  .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
it could happen in learning time scales .
you know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
two pairs of  UNK  for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
have you seen these guys ?
at midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the  UNK  .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
and therefore they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
we work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage , where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous , causing havoc and death .
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
and i made myself a bargain that if only i  UNK  my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
so for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .
and i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
&quot; moneyball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
but for african-americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
mr. jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
i have talked about four techniques for  UNK  the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives ;  UNK  -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
we have life imprisonment without  UNK  for kids in this country .
and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
each task was made up of many , many , many  UNK  of course .
because the transition seems very , very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of  UNK  .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied , even when they do objectively better .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , justin bieber , got his start on youtube .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
so now for the topic of today : financial savings .
and these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
but each time , they were  UNK  at me , eating at me .
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
and i put my challenge on 95  UNK  .
we there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some jam ?
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we  UNK  did .
thank you very much .
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
and you will have noticed that the  UNK  and tones are like &quot; avatar . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
and that &apos;s when ms.  UNK  leaned forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave , brave , brave . &quot;
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been  UNK  and released from death row .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
they &apos;re using their hands .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an irresistible challenge .
thank you .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his throat .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr.  UNK  , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets  UNK  in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
we still think it is pristine .
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
i lived in parallel worlds .
well  UNK  is a  UNK
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
let me show you how they work .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
they had been pushed genetically .
and one time we caught a live one .
