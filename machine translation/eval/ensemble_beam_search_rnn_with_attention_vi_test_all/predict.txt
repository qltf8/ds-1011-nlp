we don &apos;t know a lot about this .
come to the things that are .
in fact , all these different ways in the way that they have the ability to be able to connect with the chemical around them , growing faster , more and more  UNK  .
this is your  UNK  .
but that &apos;s an example of government as a system .
he &apos;s &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i &apos;ve got a couple of lectures in germany .
they help us build something larger than ourselves , buildings , bridges , one of them .
in fact , a lot of people , and scientists will argue that it &apos;s very different .
somebody can think that this is just a picture of the landscape and the bottom of the  UNK  .
today we &apos;re going to spend some time to talk about how video games are made in a short time , and then the reason why this is going to talk about .
it also has an app , a website and a smartphone app , called  UNK   UNK  .
when we make a right framework that we can say things with the world around us that what they don &apos;t really believe .
and i think you should read it .
and maybe i &apos;ve been so long enough to get a little bit of a  UNK  that i &apos;m not going to be able to do that .
and at that time , we have the colony colony , colony , different types of different cells , working together as a single organ .
so we have three groups of  UNK  : the  UNK  with the  UNK  of  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , and  UNK  our government
ten times three times .
she was three days after she was born .
it &apos;s  UNK  with my passion , but there &apos;s a little bit different , because using a camera , a process .
i don &apos;t know .
a guy in the middle of the city &apos;s office , to know how to this app and realized that he could use it , not for great , but to bring the  UNK  to the tsunami .
and more than 10,000  UNK  in the netherlands was found and sent back .
in other words , &quot; computers , can you make hundreds of millions of  UNK  .
a few days later , we went to a  UNK  in  UNK  and sat around her  UNK  .
and i was  UNK   UNK  .
in the mid- &apos; 80s in germany , if you owned a typewriter , you have to register it to the government .
and it &apos;s not for my guidance ; he &apos;s  UNK  .
he doesn &apos;t think anything else . he begins with the control of animals .
we can &apos;t get this problem .
and so all of them are different .
why can a judge can turn you into a person you &apos;re not ?
and this is a piece of  UNK  technology to become the most beautiful object to me .
but it did something that &apos;s not a government .
and that &apos;s used .
this kind of shame is a person .
in fact , i was confident , i was confident , and i was asking the nurses that she was going to take care of her  UNK  , &quot; which is she thought she was okay ? &quot;
they were designed designed to become light , sound ,  UNK  and sensors .
they were three  UNK  drugs .
it &apos;s a long uniform for me , because it has to wait for six years .
at that time , when we eat we wanted to go back into a  UNK  and room around the sky .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
there was a survey that was done with the ceos that we followed the ceos for a week .
i went through the emergency room on the road .
for those of you who want to choose them to give you 20 percent of the financial or not .
and for me , the combination of these things are actually necessary .
never , it &apos;s not complete wrong , but he worried about little details , about how to make mistakes .
or these pictures like this -- both dark and  UNK  , but all of them as a result of a  UNK  effect .
in 1972 , there were  UNK  .
the key thing is that the bottom line is towed on the boat , and then goes back again .
do you know a single one with a  UNK   UNK  in the  UNK  , what is the big  UNK  ?
and that &apos;s the neurological structures .
take these two programs , and they &apos;re going to create a product by making their  UNK  rules , and the product of the rules of these two rules .
the judge is an adult , but i saw him still a child .
i remember vividly every day .
her parents were born in  UNK  in virginia .
i mean , that &apos;s a simple question .
in that , there was a documentary called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
it &apos;s when you get all the emotions of politics and boundaries in the  UNK  and all the things that make us feel , the government , and the core of it , in the words of tim ferriss , &quot; they don &apos;t act . &quot;
one of two things will happen .
for almost 200 million views .
&quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s not been wrong .
and in the most exciting moments : why do you make false mistakes ?
because this process seems to be very difficult to know when we &apos;re in the middle of the process .
a huge chunk of this big data is taking this fish in the 1980s .
but what they &apos;re actually doing is that everything can happen in the context of today .
this is the  UNK  ratio , one of nine people sentenced to be  UNK  .
two teams to go to school , every time to go on the other side .
on the left is the jazz and on the right is  UNK  , but you know what &apos;s not .
i believe that we need to do more work to help people who get into the victims of crimes , not to be less .
the lego made it possible .
any of you can become famous on the internet in the next week .
but i kept working on .
they &apos;re creative inspiration .
what they need is an environmental environment for them .
so we &apos;re  UNK  .
for example , if you live in california , then this spring is going to have a referendum in here , we &apos;re trying to go into a part of using money .
so what happens here ?
we have a word that we &apos;re not born for children .
and it allows us to produce more complex products than design .
because now we &apos;re not just enjoying it , but we &apos;re participating .
&quot; oh , she goes back , &quot; it &apos;s like that .
no .
the neuron is the sensory apparatus that controls the cell .
my mother never would never be successful .
and then the  UNK  decided to use this software to help people out of the  UNK  .
do you want their kids to go through the boat ?
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
it combines images ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , sound , and the touch .
these  UNK   UNK  came up and said .
are we going to be able to do what we need to do , but don &apos;t we be able to solve the government for all of us ?
and scientists have created all these different tasks that these ceos are involved , and they spend a lot of time to do that decision to make those decisions .
my mother was  UNK  .
we have a lot of cells that they can &apos;t exist .
when i was a kid , when i looked at her she would come to me and hug me .
and the number of people were  UNK  up .
the fear of anger and anger politics makes us believe that this is not , and the problem we have .
sometimes they create hallucinations .
but at the same time , we know we can &apos;t .
and i said , &quot; yes , sir , and then we started to argue .
three months later , i moved to the location and move forward .
and i would like to tell you that the worst mistake that i had just happened in my first year , as many of my colleagues said , math .
my mom had been  UNK  , but we told each other day during the day and i heard her back home .
and he goes closer and hug me .
and do you know what people don &apos;t want to talk about their worst situations ?
thank you .
and then again , it &apos;s a different generation .
i think of art and movies may be able to gain , and the simulation .
i &apos;m a student obsessed with perfection .
and then this community is made out of people who know the story of this story , and they began to say and do something about it .
i gave three  UNK  without a  UNK  .
this is a graph showing that video when the first time became the last summer .
and they &apos;re all connected us into a larger community and faster than we have before .
whenever you &apos;re going to see that someone is someone else , someone might be your kin or somebody else , you can still find a  UNK  device .
i also believe that in many countries in this country , and of course , many of the world in the world , the  UNK  of poverty is not rich .
thank you .
one of the most important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not like the politics .
so if you look at the top , but the plan that you give you two financial assets in the middle of the 1970s , we don &apos;t .
it &apos;s closer to this  UNK  , and now you &apos;ve made a  UNK  machine .
what would you say to those who believe in this ?
it &apos;s  UNK  , and it doesn &apos;t seem to be  UNK  . &quot;
there are some of the people who used to be six  UNK  , suddenly , when we see that 30 percent of them bought a bottle of wine .
groups like  UNK  in the last 12 months and have become a vital force in the game .
these pictures are so , because of this movement is happening .
there are now nine cities now on the app .
it &apos;s going to be quiet , and this woman says , &quot; in our history , we &apos;ve been involved in  UNK  .
but you know what ?
and you think that he goes to the tail , but it &apos;s not .
but when you combine these pictures , this is a really important thing that actually has to consider , because if not , it &apos;s not going to be .
it also gave me a great deal of this huge product that i was involved with it , so i was happy , and i was busy .
how does this attack can attack ?
&quot; because from the  UNK  , she said , &quot; he said .
in the next 20 years , i wrote the newspaper and  UNK  medical medical research , i &apos;ve been studying the research and  UNK  in medicine to learn everything , from one of the first letters i wrote to the toronto of my television , &quot;  UNK   UNK  . &quot;
i started thinking , how could this happen ?
but it really requires a lot of plans .
somebody has created an old version .
and that &apos;s the brain and the neuron system .
but the cat is watching the kittens .
it &apos;s still not  UNK  .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
and i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
and some of them have a special combination of chemical elements in their components that makes them connected to the chemical , and  UNK  the big oil .
why do we have to paint the technology of the  UNK  ?
because i believe that the key to choose the best choice from the choice is that choice .
for those who have faith in government , this is when we ask ourselves about a world we want to leave our children .
so these colony began to evolve the interesting level of evolution that evolution occur is not on a cell , but on a colony that we call life .
bjorn  UNK  .
in fact , our genes , there &apos;s the same rule , and there &apos;s a  UNK  .
three is : do you remember ?
all right .
you &apos;ll probably notice the colors and the sounds like &quot; avatar . &quot;
thank you very much .
it &apos;s not just the members of the code for america , and hundreds of people around the country who are writing the daily basis in our own communities .
two years later i was a doctor in the emergency room in a hospital community in toronto , and i was a young man who was 25 years old .
life is in the centuries .
it &apos;s a  UNK  reduction .
a few minutes later , i call it .
she goes back and death .
well , let &apos;s say you live in a remote remote area , and you have a family who has a  UNK  , and a family , and a family that went on a  UNK  heart attack , which is  UNK  .
for example , in germany , a couple of weeks ago , they had discovered  UNK   UNK  , which is a  UNK   UNK  , who used to  UNK  their citizens .
UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
this is a generation of my voice to fight for the rights .
they &apos;re very ambiguous and  UNK  .
a young woman said , &quot; i &apos;m seeing today . &quot;
well , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m going to talk about a little idea .
we &apos;re experiencing the same process as the organisms that have already been discarded , which is experiencing -- selective  UNK  , expression , sensory information .
by the way , with these things i &apos;m just talking to you , or to pursue your goals , or continue to .
there are lots of fish .
i &apos;m sitting here talking to the  UNK  , hoping that in the head of people &apos;s thinking and messy and a little bit like my thinking .
it was a long time ago in the gulf of the  UNK  whales .
so i started talking .
and she sat down , looked at me , and she said , &quot; she wanted to know that she was still in my legs . &quot;
and when i walked into the , and i saw it .
i think we &apos;re going to be a  UNK  if we &apos;re the final product of evolution .
is it a photography ?
he &apos;s just hitting it .
so i feel like our mobile phones , our  UNK  clock and our camera .
the nervous system , it turns out that they form these special structures , which has accelerated the evolution of evolution .
it &apos;s not me because i think i &apos;m doing right , it &apos;s a moral ; i want to talk about the power of human spirit .
now , it turns out that even you can choose to have a lot more choices , even though there are negative consequences .
i live in two different worlds .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident that they do work because they come from a series of thousands of programs that are done .
instead of giving them to the third world , we gave them the  UNK  of the city .
oh , i guess what ?
read it ?
but today , at the moment , in this moment , if you have bought a piece of samples from any  UNK  machine , and if you try to print a piece of paper that is going to have a yellow page of paper , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
ah ,  UNK  .  UNK  , and a lot of online dating started writing about it .
and when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i hope you know the answer to you .
i grew up in the southern region , and there &apos;s a brother , bigger than i was a teenager and a little girl , a little older than me .
now i work in the solar industry .
in the last week , in a meeting with the dutch government , i had a question for a leader of whether that if you could see that it doesn &apos;t matter if anybody had to die .
well , it &apos;s a friday day , right ?
her mother was  UNK  .
but then what happens is that all of these things should be , of course , the  UNK  in exchange of information .
it &apos;s not like that .
that kind of says , it &apos;s not what you do is bad , but you &apos;re the bad guys .
so , photography to me as good as being true , right at the moment .
in fact , i didn &apos;t learned this when i was a lawyer or a lot of my work .
they put her in  UNK  .
everything can &apos;t change the way they &apos;re going on .
so what i &apos;d like to ask you today is the four simple techniques that we &apos;ve tested in many of many ways you can apply in your business .
at the same time , of course , there is a map , but the maps are .
for those who have chosen to be more interested in many more choices , more and more people participating in order to avoid  UNK  .
so in fact , i &apos;m going to go on and start  UNK  , a software application for the ipad .
and during this phase , we had a phase of time ago , but only a little bit .
and i was  UNK  with myself that if i was trying to get to be perfect and never made any mistakes , please let the  UNK  of conscience .
well , when we started our part of the evening , i had a conversation with her .
the kind of shame doesn &apos;t be healthy , i &apos;m talking about is the kind of  UNK  for you in the cage .
and then it brought the international .
how do i show you 10 minutes of the strings of the women who are women who are three generations , about how amazing  UNK  are made of the life of a little girl whose daughter &apos;s daughter , with her mother and her  UNK  in the  UNK  , and over the last seven years on the coast of
but together , they can make something like this .
and i claim that today is that the risk of us to become the victims of the greater health in the real world .
and then there was a trip .
&quot; she thinks you can do everything that you want . &quot;
but if i could have that , and i can still see me , i &apos;m going to wait for me .
the answer is , if i talk about it on a normal curve , you might say , is a year , and this is a measure of technology that i &apos;m trying to illustrate , graph is very  UNK  .
and then i was assigned to work at the heart of cardiology .
and then it &apos;s a combination of different pictures .
with  UNK  information , the same amount of choice .
i grew up in a house , an american family , and in the  UNK  , and my grandmother was a family .
there are many cases like what happened in  UNK  .
if you &apos;re a doctor , you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a  UNK  , you can do something else .
the next thing , we found in the case that people like to buy a bottle bottle .
the water is taken in a hole .
so the video of the i was about , because i didn &apos;t travel bike in the bike lanes , but there &apos;s some things that you don &apos;t get you into the bike lanes .
and so what i &apos;m going to ask , what i &apos;m still asking myself , is the new state of the world that exist ?
terrorism -- this is starting to end up at the end of the rebuilding , and we went to the world war ii .
and that &apos;s when she was  UNK   UNK  , i put my hand up on my face and said , &quot; so you should be courageous , courageous and courageous . &quot;
they had to be  UNK  in the last year , because their system had been destroyed .
the video of  UNK   UNK  : what does this mean ?
this is the  UNK  .
and the small company that i was trying to get into the environment by my attention ...
but eventually it leads to how we interpret the world and how to recognize it on a two-dimensional surface .
and she was born in the &apos; 40s and had to  UNK  the  UNK  , which was shaped by her life .
and there was a night , i was very late , and i started thinking , well , if the judge could do it .
but the numbers isn &apos;t .
the other thing that we would love to help is that the companies around the world can help us to sustain these  UNK  devices .
the next morning , i woke up and thought , i dreamed of a crazy proposal , or i actually wrote it ?
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is .
it &apos;s in  UNK  when we move it .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel like that &apos;s true . two people drink . &quot;
and the more i said , i &apos;m more .
and so my suggestion is , this is the only thing that i want to give you to the  UNK  , to  UNK  the &quot;
sure enough , we can handle the fire , and many people did .
but they &apos;re not aware of what happens as a loss .
instead , what i do is that what we &apos;ve been doing is that the designs that are working on the  UNK  , that we think about the level of the filter , and we put that filter into the machine , and that we can put it in a machine that we can make , more and more
a community community says that it comes from a  UNK  , something that all of us can be part of that .
and in fact , sometimes they do it , but we don &apos;t even understand it .
now you don &apos;t have to buy a  UNK  bottle , perhaps better than for us , for example , it &apos;s better for us to show that the problem that we have in the
i learned in my little  UNK  in the  UNK  community in the hospital in toronto , which was not far away .
if you have an opportunity to work in the center of the city , like scott  UNK  , a member of us -- in fact , all of them do -- you &apos;ll find that people to call the government with a lot of problems , there &apos;s a  UNK  mouse in your house .
this can happen in the presence of life that might be living , in the same time they form this particular structure , and that can be learned in the process of  UNK  in the thousands of thousands of death .
and so i came here , i was encouraged , and i was listening to this for me to give me a lot .
we told her and she told her to us .
in fact , every living organism is stored in its genome , and the same code .
the third technology :  UNK  .
it &apos;s not a problem .
and i met her  UNK  , she was breathing .
in egypt , when the  UNK   UNK  of the police  UNK  of egypt in egypt in 2011 , they discovered a lot of documents .
she &apos;s always the end of the family .
and the next piece of the picture is about four women , three generations together .
you can put it back in the snow .
there &apos;s a very  UNK  line of how it doesn &apos;t have the right in this country all .
and that  UNK  me to the second technique in solving the  UNK  problem that &apos;s very specific .
for a year we didn &apos;t have a  UNK  .
thank you .
you &apos;ve heard that before , but it &apos;s not much more than less .
but what is the secret to make it look like ?
but this  UNK   UNK  had been bathed in the room room for thousands of years in a  UNK  .
their rights has to argue .
i looked at him , it was a little bit  UNK  .
and if you look at the photograph , the results can be wonderful and pretty well .
and i have to tell you that that made me a lot .
think about a tough choice : buy a car .
and here you say , &quot; let &apos;s put your hands on the lights . &quot;
because it &apos;s something like it &apos;s something that has been lost .
it &apos;s a good news , because we &apos;re going to have more than the  UNK  actions of technology .
this is the main headquarters of the company .
and you can see that the problem when it comes down into the long list of all the financial .
the building structure is a very interesting step .
all right . thank you very much .
another idea that  UNK  me when a child is a large galaxy can be inserted into a single  UNK  .
and every time it turns out , they &apos;re not separate chemicals in them .
so this allows allows the bacteria that bacteria can form that in which consist of microbes that are  UNK  ; they &apos;re working together .
and we &apos;re at the time in the process of the same as the as possible as possible as we can live in  UNK  .
and just the other mistake of other people . it &apos;s not a kind of  UNK  , &quot; which is a  UNK  ,  UNK  for people to be better .
it &apos;s a system where there are two things -- the  UNK  and the people who don &apos;t , but the doctors who are not committed to sleep , and the person who &apos;s got married , and the person who &apos;s successful .
i met people from the social class , a lot of people are working on love , living in the boundaries of the opportunity .
and so this approach is good for anything that we &apos;re creative .
by the way of the environment , i think a big problem in the last 10 years is that these little girls have been stuck in the room ,  UNK  into the computer screen .
this is not ...
make money !
try to end up children &apos;s children who are not  UNK  .
UNK  .
we talked about  UNK  , there &apos;s nothing to change from ancient india .
the kind of time i wanted to look at is the time of life on earth .
this video has almost 50 million views into this year .
you can do a series of change .
and so the next process is really interesting in the life of about a billion years .
i was sitting in a hotel room in sydney in a moment where she was 600 miles away .
and the idea behind  UNK  is that it &apos;s as a kind of  UNK  .
now i &apos;ve gone out of the safe place that we have enough to know , yes , the world can collapse , but not in your head .
thank you .
now , if you can get higher .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see a  UNK  device , please send that information for us to know where it works , because sometimes it &apos;s not working .
if someone like to take hundreds of millions of copies of my business cards , i can give people in this room a lot of you , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
they listen to your internet .
my mission was to me when my mother was a nightmare to call my mom .
and i think , the  UNK  of this has changed the world .
and you &apos;ve got the damage and never again .
it &apos;s like a concrete  UNK  , which allows you to build a larger circuit and more complex ,  UNK  brick .
and you can &apos;t just do with these kinds of technologies like this , but also , &quot;
we all want to be the celebrity stars , singers , comedian , and when i was young , that seems to be very hard to do .
it was amazing , after my presentation , there was a guy who stood up and said , &quot; well , i &apos;m really happy to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
good , there are some people .
this is interesting . this is how technology is access to real life .
when this person gets the other person , our community became larger .
in the next week , a device will be released .
i think we have to do something about a traditional tradition in medicine .
the west government does that day in our country .
the next step we looked for applications for it .
now i design the computer to make money , and i know that the device i used to design the computer could not use if there &apos;s no recent technologies in the computer industry .
there was a huge impact on the species .
and let me end with my grandmother : i have a little girl .
i know she had come to me .
if we were arrested , first of me , and i , and my mom and i would drink .
i don &apos;t know about anything .
and there are hundreds of numbers .
so , i &apos;m going to go now .
it &apos;s not not a choice .
but it &apos;s not that that we can see what we have and have to pay for us to ourselves , and then we make ourselves .
and here &apos;s the point where patients can take control and collect data to their health , not just to control their own personal , their bodies , but also helps us in health care because of the challenges that we have to deal with the health care costs , the need to go and double the same .
how do you handle it ? &quot;
the other thing is that we know where all the gas stations .
i want to talk about issues and problems .
now , the patient has been touched , and he said , and he said , and he &apos;s going to go and add a little bit of his nose into his breath , and suddenly my heart had been affected .
the telephone , the computer ,  UNK  , the cd and the other things that are the devices that we create in society to work with information .
today , we do the same thing with airplanes .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; the other one is called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i learned that in the class of the beginning of the beginning and the work of her life , the  UNK  of the artery artery from the aorta , the complex disease , the rare and  UNK  .
by measuring the same amount of  UNK  , the cost to 20 percent , and more and more people are willing to save their money .
now , think about your choices .
they &apos;re still .
what about the arab spring and what happened in the  UNK  ?
i was writing this crazy thing .
sometimes i have a lot .
now , try to do a problem at least six times the people who wanted to buy a  UNK  bottle when they see six species .
so every morning i don &apos;t need to be on the ground , and before i walked up to the car , people started to tell me , &quot; i think you &apos;re lunch . &quot;
i was once in a  UNK  with a  UNK  with a  UNK  , and he took off the card and said , &quot; oh , look .
and of course , we &apos;re never going to have a  UNK  . &quot;
it &apos;s happening . we can all feel it .
&quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  is the one of the most popular video .
i said to the computer , &quot; take the process . &quot;
and i collected a small team with us , &quot; no , it &apos;s not a very interesting challenge .
well , there &apos;s a lot of opportunities around us .
they put it in adulthood .
and it &apos;s like &quot;  UNK   UNK  , &quot; it seems to tell us nothing .
and my brother said , &quot; okay , we do this today , and i always do what you do , and my sister do . &quot;
it &apos;s too late .
my mom , my sister and i slept them on a bed .
the united states is the only country in the world who are 13 children .
but for the african countries in this country is a terrible period .
if you know anything about the technology of the state , you will know that this is not normal .
because that &apos;s the consequences of that we start to have a profound view of what we are .
and i can understand and believe that each of us have to be the worst thing that we &apos;ve ever done .
good , good .
people go in the room because they &apos;re very angry .
the  UNK  is surrounded by the trees you can see , a few trees .
that the existence of all of us are intimately closely related to people .
i &apos;m not supposed to say .
as you can see , it &apos;s not just simple to play the  UNK  .
i don &apos;t know about the wine .
and the most exciting part of them is that they &apos;re  UNK  together .
good . you &apos;re willing to get a request .
now there &apos;s a project in the law of california , which has spent two billion dollars , which is still not working .
i &apos;m showing in a petition that there &apos;s a  UNK  in the  UNK  , the  UNK  behavior of police and the .
and then let &apos;s get rid of  UNK   UNK  .
we like to innovate .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our personalities .
imagine him , a  UNK  man in  UNK  , the fact that his life was  UNK  .
it turns out that the  UNK  grocery stores on the bottom , and under the  UNK  corridor of new york , where all the different kinds of different kinds of  UNK  .
what is a  UNK  mouse ? try to check it . you live ? yes .
it &apos;s time when you hear somebody else &apos;s wrong , and wrong , wrong ?
i mean , it &apos;s incredible .
because , maybe , this is a photography that you can &apos;t bring the camera .
some of my work happened in the last five years .
these colony cells , again , started to information .
and if people look at how these chemicals are formed , we start to understand how they form .
and then i looked at me .
if i start with you easily , i learned how to choose .
oh my god !
50 percent of the ceo of  UNK  , or nine minutes .
within a year , you do a survey , and then the commercial industry started .
UNK   UNK  and a  UNK  says , &quot; i &apos;m going to go through the  UNK  . &quot;
look at what &apos;s actually happening in the world , we can classify  UNK  attacks .
it &apos;s all important choice .
it &apos;s just a basic chemical form of life , but it &apos;s more interesting , but it &apos;s more interesting when they &apos;re learning to be .
in the next report i wrote , &quot; i &apos;m walking in the area , you see a  UNK  in the house .
once we got a baby .
now , it turns out that you &apos;re right .
and that , with the larger level , is what we want to do today .
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
at the day , i made a huge place where we were eating .
let &apos;s talk to al .
i want to leave you with something .
in this material is the notes from a company that has a company in the u.k. who sold for a lot of high-tech tools to be able to hear on a massive scale of all kinds of communication and communication .
now , the anonymous  UNK  in the  UNK  , the  UNK  , and the social and activist society , are everywhere in the places that have never heard that i had ever imagined .
i want to represent the voice for children .
and we wanted to start this device around the world .
now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read it , and i want you to clap if you &apos;re willing to get a request .
this is also a typical example of the public government .
this program is called the code for the united states , and this program is kind of like  UNK   UNK  for the computer .
in other words , they form , under the form of evolution , a pattern that would allow them to make them , how they could copy .
and there &apos;s a silence .
because we are and how we &apos;ve been able to see ourselves , now we can see that the men who have gone into our lives .
all right .
however , let &apos;s think about them in a way to engage in our own lives .
love technology , like creativity .
we  UNK  our own path to a new level that we don &apos;t remember before .
let me summarize .
so there &apos;s nothing changes , but everything has changed .
why do i study ?
in fact , i made two mistakes .
why am i not asking for guidance ? why is the patient home ?
who can predict &quot;  UNK   UNK  &quot; or &quot; or &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
people in the  UNK  are  UNK  in a source .
the centers were founded .
and so , i can do the same evolution of several million years in a few minutes in a few minutes , or if you look , for example , a few hours .
i &apos;m not talking about the definition of the system in technology .
well , he was actually a lot of videos of nature .
how would you feel like if you live in a world where you &apos;re eating a death sentence , especially when it &apos;s the  UNK  .
and they begin to form a special kind of  UNK  , which is not different from the information .
i &apos;m good , i &apos;m great ,  UNK  .
he said , &quot; she said to all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
this is just a random report that i chose from my material .
and i feel good .
photos like this : the building goes along the way .
every time i thought about grandma , i know she thinks that all the grandchildren are special .
so why do i worry ?
it can happen in the process of information .
now i want to have kids , and i wonder about the boat .
here &apos;s an example .
so , you know , what do you call a  UNK  player ?
he just wanted to see people .
my grandfather was in the  UNK  , and  UNK  wine .
and those choices make change the choices that they make decisions .
and the surprising thing is that that information is that it &apos;s very stable , because it &apos;s evolved from a billion years ago .
maybe i don &apos;t want to make a  UNK  .
they become more vulnerable , because they &apos;re  UNK  .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the number of apps and the members who wrote last year .
we don &apos;t want to talk about history .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
this story . we heard a lot of times about the galapagos and other places . so there &apos;s nothing special about it .
and i said , &quot; computers , can you choose 10 percent of the random number of random things that do the best job .
and the obvious truth is that these risks are getting worse .
but now , the video on the web has done that for any of us , or any kind of creative product that we can make a fully  UNK  in a culture of our world .
and if you &apos;re asking questions about other things , they &apos;re also on friday .
this is the  UNK  oil .
and when you use the camera to take the camera , you end up the end of the end .
we want to maintain the things that are not going to be , or anything else .
we did an app on the  UNK  approach to find these  UNK  devices .
i decided to go to the united states .
most of our ideas were crazy , but some great ideas , and we created the breakthrough .
but this technology with mobile technology , we can bring them out , in the natural world .
in 2010 , video has 23 million views .
and i went there because i grew up in europe , and they wanted to be able to work in africa .
well , yeah , you have a cocktail party and you may listen to a story of a doctor , but you &apos;re not going to listen to somebody else .
and what happens is that you &apos;re going to create a digital collection that you can put on the internet .
and we think this is one of the main problems that why all of all -- -- not all of the medical projects that fail fail , since we &apos;re not listening .
but on the  UNK   UNK  , everything was recorded , to see all .
i asked to leave the water to the patient , and i was able to bring him back to him .
that i have a  UNK  ,  UNK  , black and poor .
the earliest memory i remember is from the boat -- the engine , the bed net , the  UNK  of the  UNK  .
the people who have created , the communities of creative commons , but the whole thing that &apos;s now , is the characteristics of a traditional form of cultural and new culture that anyone can access to the audience .
there &apos;s a patient that i think is the kidney .
it &apos;s hard to say how the image is made .
that &apos;s our system .
many communities were terrified .
and there are seven million people who were  UNK  or  UNK  .
you have to  UNK  antibiotics and recover after a few days .
chicago  UNK  software to allow people to  UNK  the  UNK  .
so when i asked you a question of what i don &apos;t see , if you want to burn an extra amount of weight , just to raise your hands .
all of adults are all kinds of risks .
so you &apos;ve heard , and you can see your wish for the audience , the ted community to help him on your way and do something for this problem .
and we wanted this material access to people .
and even when he was walking out of his head , he &apos;s kind of like .
we have a generation growing up with the development of the internet , and we know what &apos;s hard to get together , you just control the system .
when i was a graduate student from stanford , i used to a lot of grocery stores , and i was really rich .
and finally , i finally walked out of the car , the money .
this is a dead  UNK  .
make it easy to use techniques and start with them to make sense of the patients in patients .
but a member called  UNK   UNK  , attention to one another thing , which is that people are still walking in front of those things .
this is a german car that gives you an opportunity to get your car in the way you want .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we took the  UNK  for the experiment .
i &apos;m going to focus on a number that i hope you &apos;ve heard about .
if we call the center of the animal , it will cost more money .
so , one day , i decided to give the manager , and i said , &quot; what new people call these choices really work ? &quot;
but the point is , we &apos;re still in the galapagos .
it doesn &apos;t stop and stress .
as some of you know that i have over 100,000 people on twitter .
but something happened to  UNK   UNK  .
so one of the living body , for example , learn to not have any kind of  UNK  , because it &apos;s not  UNK  , and it &apos;s not  UNK  .
so he helped people to test the lights .
three levels of a trait that you will always want to be close .
where are the housing ?
how can it look for help in a situation like this ?
you can pay this on google , but it &apos;s disease , not the  UNK  , but it &apos;s the part of the , and it can lead to the  UNK  .
people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it . &quot;
if it &apos;s true , it means that we &apos;re in the middle of the  UNK  .
and so , there &apos;s a  UNK  .
so what you need to do is the green place to green , and then you &apos;re going to be able to start to make bigger .
let &apos;s imagine the first piece : a man  UNK  his team .
for example , the  UNK  story , some of the people who &apos;ve been told about the captain , saw a lot of fish in this area that they can &apos;t eat or not being used by the  UNK  scientists , because it doesn &apos;t have any kind of science .
this is happening faster and that &apos;s why i think it &apos;s pretty ambiguous .
nobody knows where there is the most  UNK  device to save lives on the right now .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember this .
the third principle is to make it in real , where the different pictures began to end and end by making them .
in a world , i &apos;m a typical student ,  UNK  .
we settled in  UNK  , the suburbs in the suburbs of the workforce in the  UNK  .
and i see that combination of these photographs have a similar process .
even pick the engine that doesn &apos;t tell me about anything about attention to the interior , it &apos;s going to help me know how to make a choice .
people are always confused when i say , &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
every single one gives you to 100,000 products .
there are  UNK  .
and again , i even put the house on the top of the island to make it in the  UNK  .
finally , you want to maintain the other things .
we have a bias based on the experience of examples , for example , i can be a  UNK  patient .
but what are we doing with it ?
i know that this talk will be  UNK  .
crime in the united states has declined a lot of three decades .
she was so strong , powerful and powerful power in the family .
and the development of that means that means that the  UNK  on the countries that have the  UNK  of the  UNK
and if you think on the left is the jazz , and on the right must be  UNK  .
there &apos;s a source of energy out there , a  UNK  , a  UNK  of  UNK  and  UNK  .
for those who are not engineers ,  UNK  has become a different kind of material , electronic material has become a new material .
the other way of thinking about this is not whether or do we have a  UNK  or whether we have to kill them ?
occasionally , i went to and on the third side , but it &apos;s hard to get her attention to me .
UNK  !
and these are the most primitive patterns , but that little  UNK  .
and within a hundred and a half hours , two hours later , she began to feel better .
i fear the idea that i would lose my ability to enjoy and enjoy the  UNK  without the camera , which didn &apos;t get on twitter to my friends .
it was a privilege for me to be here , and i share with people .
i came to ted , because i believe that many of you understand that the moral mind is this very long time , but it &apos;s the public sector .
instead of telling us money , what can we help ?
and these are very important activities , but they can steal their energy from them .
as you can see here , these pictures are not special .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i asked you to consider , because everything is changing .
because , obviously , a kind of animal that &apos;s plentiful , before it &apos;s gone extinct .
and so when i saw the ipad , i saw it was a  UNK  storytelling that was able to connect around the world .
but it doesn &apos;t seem to create a video .
we &apos;ve got some good things from the y-axis of biodiversity , the number of whales that are the  UNK  of the country .
who doesn &apos;t love baseball , right ?
i think that our personalities are missing .
and what we did , now i know that this is the sea .
but this is not recorded .
you have to recognize the big challenges that they face .
of course , the task is made a lot of small choices .
now is the first question of today , are you ready to hear about the  UNK  problem ?
this is what happens when you look like normal , and instead of  UNK  here , a little bit of blood flow , and then the blood flow , and then the  UNK  .
and the black man stood up and looked at the  UNK  street , and then he looked at me , and he looked at me , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to talk about this young man , or  UNK  in his own . &quot;
i mean , as you mentioned earlier , one of the largest stars in the world , justin bieber , starting with youtube .
he said , &quot; you  UNK  , do you have to write this crazy ? &quot;
there &apos;s no apple .
you talk to the patient family , and i &apos;m pretty sure that you &apos;re going to be fine , and make sure that i &apos;m not being sued .
they . give you a little bit .
my mother had been  UNK  about the boat .
we all have heard about the  UNK  , we all heard about  UNK  , but there &apos;s no  UNK  in india , which is , in the  UNK
and what we see is is that there &apos;s a number of resources available to the cost of saving a 401 plan to make it possible to save more tomorrow .
and in a few days , there &apos;s a black hole between the cloud and the sun , and i wondered , maybe i can feel better than once again .
slowly ,  UNK  .
so to get a result , i think it &apos;s going to go to plan .
&quot; not only  UNK  . &quot;
she had broken  UNK  .
and sometimes you go to ted , it &apos;s meaningful and the power to you that if you &apos;re not going to have the power .
we asked around and nobody knows .
the patient has a lot of diarrhea .
technology is ...
so , if technology is fast as fast as technology , technology , i can call a taxi and  UNK  in the next 30 seconds .
after two years , i learned a special conclusion with the local authorities , the  UNK  mouse .
and my mother still has time to learn english and take a technology .
and it turns out that it &apos;s more obvious , the more that becomes more effective to help people save more .
i still don &apos;t know what you think about me , but i can get that .
the book is , &quot; it &apos;s going to be released , and it &apos;s basically talking about statistics and use data to build a baseball baseball .
there they &apos;re going to write these amazing applications , working with staff .
in fact , he collected the fish .
so the first step of the story i told people in a billion years .
maybe a little bit to run video .
my mother , her age , she was 18 years old -- she had a family , a  UNK  marriage , had two little girls .
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest problems of our choice is that the problem with a lot of choices .
and that is the connection of the heart and the , and the , that i believe that will make us not only pay attention to things , but it &apos;s hard .
they said , you know , you know , you know .
scott is this .
now , you can do all of those random  UNK  , running all of those programs , and pick up the most  UNK  programs that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
last year , we had a team in boston to program in america for america .
it &apos;s three young men in the age of 18 to 30 , there &apos;s one person in prison , or  UNK  .
this is a problem between liberals and control .
but the ad is still getting information that they &apos;re not touched .
now i &apos;m going to show you more .
&quot; the second thing that she wanted to do is that you will always do the right thing .
it &apos;s not that we need to struggle , effort .
the purpose of this is to be the government to know the origin of those documents .
and i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s not . i &apos;m not going to drink a beer . &quot;
in another chapter , you have to photograph a piece of  UNK  and  UNK  it .
and i think there are  UNK  that are going to explain how to begin with it , but i &apos;m going to tell you a very simple story about it , the story , at the time , there are tiny little spots around it .
pay attention to the community .
somebody has gone into the system and it destroyed it .
and here &apos;s a new thing we &apos;re talking about the  UNK  curve .
it &apos;s just like this .
i think i &apos;ll hear a lot more .
and because that idea could be explained for a minute . i &apos;ll tell you three stories to get into the time .
now if i talk about cities , for example , another technology , could be technology , on a  UNK  curve , it would be absurd , like a straight line .
before i really started the importance of the presentation , let &apos;s start with baseball .
occasionally , when i lost my balance , i &apos;m going to end with this story .
and i &apos;ll never forget it .
well , i think the  UNK  of our current  UNK  is , no help .
and there are only about 12 percent of their decisions that they &apos;re actually done in a more or more .
about 10 minutes after the judge claim .
alfred  UNK  .
what i want to show you is not just the details of the report that &apos;s what it is .
but in the end , in fact , in fact , this is still  UNK  by  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
and my colleagues are working on , and when you see the  UNK  on the right side , the surgeon .
i began to work with this petition with the title , &quot; you &apos;ve got to try to help a  UNK  kid who is like a director of a  UNK  ,  UNK  , 75 . &quot;
my mother had a computer store and then  UNK  a  UNK  and a different business .
completely surprising and humor , casey  UNK  gave her ideas and my opinion for five million views .
you &apos;re green to the green , you can make the circuit .
and i don &apos;t have a  UNK  or  UNK  , i mean , you know , the idea that we &apos;re in a child .
at the time that happens when those communities come together , so in fact , they together form a recipe for a whole sequence of a single dna .
this is a fight against drug .
that allows people to understand the difference between choice , they have to be able to understand the outcome of the choices and the results that are very clear .
so an app is built in a few days , and it &apos;s  UNK  , and it &apos;s a shortcut in order to build the government system .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to be able to build beautiful , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
but i &apos;m afraid of  UNK  , the life of my life .
&quot; it &apos;s her granddaughter daughter , and i promise you will always take care of you . &quot;
the rocks were quickly becoming the building material built in the world .
and the rest of that day , i had a sense of feeling in the cage .
there are three reasons : the people who create , the communities and the
thank you very much .
so he made the work that any programmer would do is write an app .
but there &apos;s a big difference : it &apos;s just for experts .
in fact , we all know that the design process is not  UNK  when it &apos;s too complicated .
and there &apos;s no idea in the history of development development in terms of climate change by changing the number of years .
we see this , but we don &apos;t want to talk about your own problems .
by the way , it &apos;s a  UNK  that is 10 times as well .
according to the time we focus on the big animals in the sea , we focus on the big fish .
and i was shocked and  UNK  me down .
and fortunately , patients are not dead .
stephen  UNK  .
thank you .
so i went to  UNK   UNK  , and the ambulance came home , and she took her home home .
&quot; the first thing that she wanted to do is that you must always love . &quot;
we &apos;re trying to help people convicted .
and what we did , we didn &apos;t find it out .
&quot;  UNK  sand &quot; is an animation image of music .
it &apos;s about the  UNK  movement .
and then one day -- this is actually a report -- there &apos;s something that happens : &quot; a  UNK  mouse in the trash .
and it seems like no one &apos;s going to say , &quot;
we wanted to integrate all the interactions in the world in the &quot;  UNK  &quot;
we &apos;ve taken six different types of different types of different types of different types of different types of different types of  UNK  , and we found two things : the first thing , in the case that people want to stop , throw a few  UNK  ?
some of the bacteria find out how to prevent drugs , and it &apos;s going to spread around the information of their dna with other bacteria , and today we have a lot of microbes that are resistant to  UNK  , because bacterial bacteria .
the project helps to find the public school to fit their children .
in the big cities in this country like los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington , 50 to 50 percent of the people who are in the same condition , they &apos;re  UNK  , or  UNK  .
like many people , i think the basic government is just getting people to vote .
we have a search for funding and the sponsors .
but a lot of years , many of them have been helped .
the lego took off the concrete , the  UNK  building the world , and made it into the bricks of imagination .
because the self tells me how to divide them .
let me show you a simple example .
and i thought , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
and there are many other projects in every level of the state system .
you &apos;re busy .
but at the top of the nearest  UNK  device to get this patient ?
they learn how to store information , which is the  UNK  of cells into a chemical chemical called dna .
and in fact , if i know and my colleagues know that my colleagues that i had a  UNK  of my  UNK  , of my hospitals , believe me , i &apos;m going to have trouble in the face .
the only challenge was three to 10 .
now , who &apos;s ready for this ?
there &apos;s three  UNK  .
in fact , the existence of these programs depends on the work .
when i started this program , i don &apos;t know about the government .
it looks like looking for a date , but it &apos;s actually waiting for somebody , because he knows that i wasn &apos;t good at the fire when you &apos;re in  UNK  .
the question is , why do people accept this ?
i didn &apos;t have anything  UNK  .
today i &apos;m going to talk today about what i did .
they seem to make the worse choices worse , health care .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually lie , but i always want it to look like in a way in a way .
they want to tell their story . they want to share their story .
because after all , all of us depend on this planet .
my fourth technology : the conditions for complexity .
and so here , each of the book and the world became a little  UNK  that i put on in this piece of device .
and i think this starts from a doctor , that &apos;s me .
i had my  UNK  , i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t .
go ahead and start to invent .
every single one is used to go and to learn more english , and it &apos;s given to any place , whether it doesn &apos;t matter whether it doesn &apos;t work , but it &apos;s a new clothes ; it &apos;s a new clothes ; it &apos;s time .
now , the mistake is that it &apos;s not easy to be especially when you do in a hospital that when i was only 14 to a patient .
i &apos;m going to give you an example of what i &apos;m talking about .
for example , here we have the designers that don &apos;t know what the video begins to play with the creative tool .
and finally , he said , &quot; look , don &apos;t you have to open all the door to your house and playing music , and see what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and that &apos;s an amazing experience .
we know exactly what the machine is in these  UNK  cities .
you &apos;re really inspiring .
so what happens ?
the light , the sound , the solar panel , the engine -- everything is accessible .
there &apos;s a  UNK  africa , 20 percent of  UNK  , with  UNK   UNK  .
in fact , the  UNK  is jimmy .
we can solve many more  UNK  than we deal with options .
in south africa , people knew that they couldn &apos;t be able to tolerate the  UNK  if they didn &apos;t commit to the truth and do it .
and that &apos;s what i feel .
these applications are helping us to society .
maybe i wanted to be successful , and from the responsibility responsible for me to do it from the patient &apos;s couch , but i don &apos;t communicate with him .
my story starts right here , at the end of about two years ago .
and then the woman came to tell their story about the men who couldn &apos;t fit in their lives , anger and  UNK  , and the kids who were between the two worlds .
we predict that 10 years ago , the average rate of citizenship would be  UNK  before .
these companies can be  UNK  services or services , for example , just to make sure that the devices are sent to information about it .
and so here , you need to be the ipad , to take the firefly .
we were all of our colleagues around all over the world , the universities , to help us , to work , work and work as an information center for information on the world .
we wanted to take the world of the innovators , the inventors and the innovators , because the world , where we live , the world of our interaction .
yes . we make sense , we have to be intellectual .
according to estimates , there are more than 400 billion people that are produced -- or 75 people per person on earth .
our legal system is not only shaped by the way , not only  UNK  by a racial discrimination , but by  UNK  .
it &apos;s going to change it -- it changes , and it &apos;s changed by the natural impact .
he came here in the  UNK  years , you know .
and at the same time i realized that the  UNK  is , , every one -- and it &apos;s not just , but it &apos;s something that we need to be grateful , maybe a gift from the boat .
you &apos;ve got a little bit , you know , you &apos;ve got a little bit , and i &apos;ve got a drink . &quot;
their war doesn &apos;t look like we &apos;re not going to be the people ; they all have to do that .
i remember like that day , just like that .
every time you do , you have to name it , and you name the first one .
and when i was 14 , 15 years old , i went home , and i was about six feet , i didn &apos;t know where he had it from his head , and he grabbed me from my head and my sister was going into the forest .
and she &apos;s almost no spoken word poetry and she  UNK  .
and here &apos;s what we did , we &apos;ve been using the &quot;  UNK  &quot; in the netherlands .
now , it &apos;s almost like an amusement park .
if you don &apos;t do it , somebody else can get it .
because if you don &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to  UNK  vision , maybe it &apos;s easy to accept the bias in your area .
now , these  UNK  ideas are constantly in our thinking that they &apos;re very important .
and my doctor would also be able to get these data , so that he can see the problems with my weight , not only at the time that i needed to support , or something like that .
i &apos;ve been through a long time living in the community of low-income people with the projects and the  UNK  of despair .
i have a complex thought , messy , and ambiguity in mind .
&quot; do you remember the patient ? &quot;
and of course , of course , terrorism has been  UNK  and ethnic  UNK  and  UNK  and apartheid .
now , i don &apos;t remember the  UNK  to a lot of times , but it was thrown away by the  UNK  of the man on the boat , or when the ships were dead and didn &apos;t .
and finally , i believe that the fact is that this is very , very exciting , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
let &apos;s start .
and then we opened a little piece of  UNK  on the shop .
and surely , we can find a series of fast food .
&quot; come on , &quot; i said , &quot; and you don &apos;t have somebody else . &quot;
every single one in every generation is just a few milliseconds .
but that &apos;s not all the  UNK  mouse .
and then the family came together .
this is a map from the zoom out of the chamber and the light , and it shows the direction for the rest of the book .
it &apos;s actually violence against violence .
they noticed that the city didn &apos;t get rid of the  UNK  .
what they need is a medical culture .
if you don &apos;t , when you ask , and if you answer , you &apos;re happy .
UNK  is  UNK  ; and nobody knows where he is .
the united states has the highest highest  UNK  in the world .
it &apos;s a small application that you can locate  UNK  .
i was interested in this shop , but in nature , i used to ask myself , how do you go and not buy ?
each generation will use the images that they have learned from the beginning of their life as a standard , and it &apos;s going to be .
the second story , is to  UNK  for another notion of what &apos;s called the  UNK  movement .
for example , in particular cases , we can actually develop a program by starting with  UNK  .
they seem to choose what they do less happy when they get better .
but when this happens , everything changes .
most people understand that , but they think that this is the other one .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know a secret that
because evolution evolution can happen in one individual .
so this video is posted on a month .
these pictures are completely made by images from different parts .
and these fish seem to be comfortable .
we &apos;re going to go ahead , we &apos;re going to go into the world .
every tool is right here , and the only thing to do is our limitations .
because the picture made it actually more than you .
in that same year , at the bell labs , a computer revolution that was going to be published , the next generation of the bricks .
&quot; in germany don &apos;t have a death penalty .
and that &apos;s true . a page for scott .
i &apos;m very sorry about that , but i try to learn something that i can inspire others .
and part of that story is sometimes due to the time .
but in fact , what we &apos;re going to see is that if you &apos;re willing to get rid of the choices that are going to reduce the amount of reducing the amount of revenue , reduce the cost of money , and that &apos;s improvement in the experience of choice .
all of us , or at least , most of us are using an app or a different app app , and these services are particularly popular in the countries like iran , where citizens are going to use the services that are known as they &apos;re  UNK  , and they are coded by the way that they can
my grandmother was sitting in front of me .
and it &apos;s going to  UNK  this petition , to make a petition to try and to make sense of fairness .
and i was made out of this piece of pieces of light , but they didn &apos;t fit together .
three  UNK  used to  UNK  a lot of times , and she walked along with two friends of people who were  UNK   UNK  , who  UNK   UNK  on the bus in the  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , a white woman whose husband was  UNK   UNK  , who was  UNK   UNK  .
UNK  anderson ,  UNK   UNK  and so forth .
suppose you get  UNK  , and you get to a  UNK  surgeon with the  UNK  surgery .
and she said , &quot; what are you going to do ? &quot;
i can &apos;t .
when i was 17 years old , she became the  UNK  of a  UNK  ,  UNK  his wife .
who gets the information ?
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
i &apos;ll never forget her .
you just lose the animals .
and it &apos;s the threat of terrorism .
and so i had perfect .
if you take the button , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; which means that you have a lot of choices , and that means that you lose me .
and yet , when you look at this problem , it &apos;s going to be like , &quot; okay , it &apos;s bad , but it doesn &apos;t affect me because i &apos;m a  UNK  citizen .
fifteen , 20 minutes left three days , and through the room , and i said , &quot;  UNK  ,  UNK  . &quot; and i &apos;m going to talk . &quot;
so the system is going to be able to create an easy approach to make the mistakes that make the mistakes that we can &apos;t wear and also create , a  UNK  , , where , in fact , where anyone in the health care system can be able to make mistakes , and especially people like me ,
we can make them start doing things that they don &apos;t think they do .
it &apos;s not really what it is , it &apos;s what we think it &apos;s real .
so i should ask them a little bit .
and you know the patient , you can get more information about three .
if you can get higher , because i &apos;m a piece of paper here .
and we know that it doesn &apos;t mean when you think about 30 , 50 years later , because everything is going to be very different from a very simple way that we &apos;re going to do today .
because the creator of the  UNK   UNK  introduces us to new things and interesting things like to make a greater audience .
i &apos;m here to share with my photography .
you know , finally , we have to believe in what we &apos;ve never seen .
i told my mom couldn &apos;t do it .
you see the ice sheet of  UNK  , like this , and now you &apos;ve got the lights .
and so , we have three wars against people who have been taken from their own  UNK  , or  UNK   UNK  , instead of what they get to them .
UNK  percent of the  UNK  didn &apos;t work .
now these are two different types .
so now , what i do is to design with the complexity of complexity that seems to be  UNK  in the traditional way .
friday , friday . go on the friday of the people who are looking at the weekend , the sixth , friday , friday , and then you &apos;re not going to think that we &apos;re talking about today , i &apos;m hoping that .
and when i heard of her  UNK  , i could hear the  UNK   UNK  in both sides that she was convicted of  UNK  .
and it &apos;s 95 percent of killing people who are not arrested .
but it &apos;s not going to be allowed to be allowed to be encouraged to encourage a lot .
she told us her hands .
there &apos;s a couple of a few years ago . she &apos;s got a series of success .
and in fact , we are a colony colony .
and if we have trust , a blind way in any future , a government that we could have in the next 50 years ?
what you &apos;re looking for is that people go from the lower choices , and it &apos;s going to get the button , and then continue again .
i always tried to explore them and show you how it works .
and let &apos;s copy them in the same way of reproduction . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but the bacteria can actually use dna .
and so in a perspective , it &apos;s approaching us .
they &apos;re going to argue that it &apos;s been shown in the early way that they don &apos;t go in the direction that they wanted to be presented .
now , i &apos;m optimistic , so i think it can go in this way .
if i just showed you a new yorker magazine , and i split it out to 10 times more than when i only give you 400 magazines and split it into the 20 , you believe that i &apos;ve given you a lot of choices , and if you &apos;ve got to give you a little bit more than
it became the  UNK  that open up a world filled with  UNK  and  UNK  and images of my imagination .
pretty simple .
because at the moment , a single person -- the information that could happen in the presence of a living organism , rather than in this evolution .
when the  UNK  &amp; amp ; amp ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and i really think that the most important thing is that we don &apos;t have to hear anymore .
so i think it &apos;s pretty simple .
but combine in a way , they create something that looks like in three dimensions , like that .
i &apos;m just talking about a human system to help each other .
so , if you look at the system , as i was taught , and eliminate all the  UNK  workers , they don &apos;t .
my  UNK  all around me .
and in fact , they &apos;re pollen in the colony and the special structures that are responsible for their notes , read , understand information .
and he looked at me , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not going to be too much about having to talk about my talk , and you . &quot;
i feel like anyone can do that .
my third little story is that when i was a  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  the  UNK  from the  UNK
and gary said that he was willing to help people in this morning , i think it &apos;s money for free to the best in the world .
they go from the lower option , they &apos;re stuck there .
to do that , i &apos;m going to talk about something that really doesn &apos;t have to do with technology and computers .
she &apos;s trying to do something about death .
because we &apos;re also talking about the need to hope more to more and more important to the fundamental challenges in life , in this complex world .
what makes a hallucination ?
it gives a software that takes a couple of years .
and she was this idea during the winter , i knew i had to take a few months to prepare , to find different places for the parts of the photos .
they didn &apos;t give up .
if you take an item that doesn &apos;t belong to their ownership , they &apos;re not just a  UNK  .
we have to invest in the framework .
and find the most  UNK  show to the numbers .
and that &apos;s where i first learned .
because i &apos;m often trying to explain to people understand how new technologies are going to be amazing , and i think , because i &apos;ve been here in the audience , i &apos;m going to show you my thoughts and try to figure out what &apos;s going on and to try and understand what &apos;s going on in
one of the things that we did at the university of  UNK  is a  UNK  .
and the more we can be more in the choices that we can be better in the practice of choice .
but they do work .
could i give me one of my life in the life , the  UNK  in the river , the  UNK  , no  UNK  , no matter what
and when i stepped on the end of the court , there was a black man who was older than me , he was the  UNK  .
this is the store with  UNK  .
but the great  UNK  of the  UNK  on top of the world &apos;s top of the world today is  UNK  , and it shows just a product of a  UNK  .
when i was a little girl , and i went to my  UNK  .
well , this is not okay , right ?
and any time you &apos;re in a city like a  UNK  that somebody who has been  UNK  , you can use your iphone , and within a couple of weeks i can run on the phone of the microsoft to find the most  UNK  device that can save lives .
for example , the most complex version of us know the language of humankind .
and so you &apos;ve got to make wind up and wind and reading the rest of the book .
they can take the idea in any vehicle , and they &apos;re still doing it .
in rwanda , even after the genocide of the genocide , there was a commitment to come in these countries , we haven &apos;t been able to do that .
i &apos;m  UNK   UNK  to three  UNK  .
the one is that we &apos;ve been out there , and that &apos;s crazy .
we are actually working with lawsuits .
we don &apos;t choose anything even when it comes to contrary to the things that are good for us .
it &apos;s for those who can see the protected areas and those who can benefit from the profound understanding that it can come to what they can  UNK  their  UNK  .
when i want to make fear , a simple example that i &apos;ve done .
they have more than  UNK  different types .
he was his grandfather .
that means with no control , always  UNK  and  UNK  things .
i went to the gym .
before i finish , let me tell you about my grandmother .
i &apos;m not a  UNK  ; it &apos;s not the same time .
let &apos;s tell them that we had to grow up with that .
and i  UNK  everything .
now , it &apos;s not that the choices that are the choices that any of us have to tell people when you consider the financial crisis for them .
and the verb that they would come out , they would  UNK  fear , and then they would look down and  UNK  and start to tell me their story .
so there &apos;s a little bit of motivation for this .
the  UNK   UNK   UNK  this is going to work for the number of fish , and they actually have a lot of them , and they &apos;ve got a lot better than the average income in ghana .
this is now in the  UNK  of the  UNK  .
and for that , when i was a graduate student at the end of the last year , i was elected to australia .
the difference is that they &apos;re aware of a loss .
okay , you have to go back .
but what makes this machine simply is that whenever i stand up , it &apos;s sending my data through google .
al is a  UNK  in boston .
UNK  is a  UNK  company that came from the netherlands -- or at least they did .
at the end of the process , i &apos;m going to have a perfect program .
if you think about it , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a great invention .
the best thing to do is that young people start to understand the activity of the daily devices around them what they &apos;re not in school .
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re going to take their place .
some of the people stop when we gave 24 24 , only three percent of them bought a bottle .
nobody has to allow your ideas .
i looked through the  UNK  and the right there .
and that happens .
and by the government  UNK  the power of us -- remember , &quot; what are we humans ? &quot; -- what do we think about it will change the change .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this amazing video of a  UNK  people in the new york city , i had to admit that i wasn &apos;t interested in .
at the beginning , i thought we were playing a game .
now , i talked a lot about magic .
so , for example , 300 , 300  UNK  .
we also brought  UNK  to design courses .
and we built an app on the ipad .
i &apos;ve been talking about four techniques to deal with the  UNK  choices -- reduce the ability to minimize the amount of stresses -- namely -- to make it more practical -- the way we deal with more  UNK  , more the less choice for the complexity .
when the  UNK  is cut out of 10 percent of the product to the cat , they see that the increase in the profits of a  UNK  increase in terms of the revenue and the  UNK  .
and we can &apos;t stabilize the government until we do a good job .
maybe a couple of life .
last year , the  UNK   UNK  posted this video , he took his outside his house in yosemite national park .
we don &apos;t have conflict .
a couple of weeks ago , we took a  UNK  , and i gave them a couple of designers that didn &apos;t have any experience with the beer , wood and paper -- and told them , &quot; do something . &quot;
i was in the desert in the desert , under the sky , like the  UNK  ,  UNK  .
even though i thought it would be easier to even create more context than finding the context , because then you don &apos;t need to organize the ideas in the mind .
when she was three  UNK  , i had a little voice in my lap told me , &quot; well , it &apos;s not a good idea . don &apos;t work . &quot;
turns out , he &apos;s not  UNK  .
this is the work of the brilliant people at the  UNK  office in boston .
in the future , the vast majority of  UNK  will happen in the world .
i &apos;m a  UNK  in a new concept .
and these are not the characteristics of the media landscape , and it &apos;s almost impossible to the media today , but they &apos;re going to decide what the future of the future .
at the time , when  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , it &apos;s not going to  UNK  , you don &apos;t go into the ground and water .
people have seen a little example of the evolution of evolution when he &apos;s evolved on the  UNK  show in front of us .
i went into my ear .
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
how do i teach them what i did ?
a few years ago , i started a program searching for technology and created for them to think about a year and work in the environment , they seem to hate them ; they had to work for government .
now the average age of membership in our group is the 28 , the envy is that i &apos;m almost older than all of them .
i had a book since i was 16 years old .
and the next stage , like the nervous system and brain , a few hundred million years .
oh my god . oh my god .
and this is also one of the three main messages on the web .
if there &apos;s a resource in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
she grew up in the age of  UNK  , which is the social norm and the local  UNK  .
and during the process , i collect more and more knowledge .
we &apos;re never going to do that in our countries .
but it has a  UNK   UNK  .
we &apos;re just -- we can ignore -- i &apos;m going to skip the video ...
and i went through time to  UNK  myself from my own  UNK  and felt , and then , again , again , again , again .
it &apos;s because the state is like the ocean and politics is just a thick layer of six feet on the surface .
this is a small application .
and so -- it says , &quot; this book is ... &quot; and so i built my name .
this is going to talk to you if you call your  UNK  from your city .
knowing that we can &apos;t do people when we care about human rights and dignity .
all right , a little bit more .
in the next few weeks , i  UNK  myself and the first time that i have experienced in my own culture in our medical culture -- in my culture , i felt lonely alone ,  UNK  , not feeling helpless as a normal person , because i couldn &apos;t talk to my colleagues .
but the first  UNK  concrete was produced in  UNK  with a very simple idea : the  UNK  of  UNK  with the  UNK
a lot of people have stopped , about 60 percent when we give up 24 , and when only six species , it &apos;s only 40 percent .
you think the index of the  UNK  for a surgeon , a nurse or a surgeon surgeon , a surgeon , who is a  UNK  ?
we even have it in the telephone .
we &apos;re giving our children , and we &apos;re closer close to the natural world and the magic and the joy of our children , and we have a very simple vehicle is a story .
unlike the kind of entertainment of the 20th century , in this community is how we become part of a phenomenon by spreading or do something new .
&quot; when we &apos;re in eastern europe , dealing with the oppression we want to get all the things that we need to be in love with a spiritual spirit , and the willingness to be honest with a  UNK  . &quot;
he died ,  UNK  .
two times in an emergency room , i &apos;m not  UNK  .
i think that the reason of that is because we all feel something that &apos;s happening at the moment .
a lack of sleep deprivation .
for example , the invention of speech is a small step in that way .
not only that , you have to register a piece of paper that comes out of a typewriter .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
at the end of a black hole and told us that he had to be  UNK  .
during the  UNK  , the  UNK   UNK  police were  UNK  by the  UNK  .
but there are over 48 hours of video on youtube every minute .
but i remember him from the oil spill out of the coast of the coast , and a young man who had gone down , and that was the end of the journey that i was filled with him , and through the first apple that i was thrown out , through which i was thrown out , through
and i remember , at the time , i was about eight , nine years old , i was teaching , into the living room , and i saw all the  UNK  around the room .
they were terrified .
the  UNK  needs to say something that i chose , rather than the choice .
the united states senate , two months ago , the  UNK  bank accounts of jain , who in his  UNK  with  UNK  million dollars at the time .
the little thing we added in that , we asked people to figure out what the positive things would happen in their future if they save more .
it &apos;s not politics , but the bureaucratic system .
and of course ,  UNK   UNK  will not be able to get the numbers , so , none of the brain will actually make the task .
when i was a kid , i had a series of collections of rock , rock and  UNK  .
and the emergency room would stop the way .
and she was clinging to me that i could barely breathe , and then she left me .
UNK  , you actually have the  UNK  .
but what &apos;s even more important is that it &apos;s only that the new generation of dealing with the problem of government -- not a problem of a rigid system , but the collective action .
when this man saw me , he came back to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
the theme today is going to continue : saving finance .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m very proud of you . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he described one of them is very common . &quot;
and the report came to my doctor .
a few months ago , i seem to forget this .
these arguments are not rational .
well ,  UNK  , judge judge .
if you generalize this , something like this is going to happen .
so what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to change the  UNK  of those decisions .
that &apos;s where the blood pressure is connected to the iphone or something else .
it shows that we can actually solve a lot more information , we can do it easier .
if the government figured out the documents , but they don &apos;t have to be able to figure out who are the  UNK  of &quot;
at the end , if you think about &quot;  UNK  , &quot; if you think about how it has a  UNK  -- you don &apos;t pay attention to the story of what it is .
my mother worked in the farm , and then in the production line , the next week , two weeks .
it &apos;s a  UNK  .
so what happens here ?
and within eight or nine days , they gave their fate .
and that made me sad .
there &apos;s another half of the customers , go from the lower option , four engines , and then i got a higher choice .
transistors is a plastic electronics that &apos;s going to take us from the world of the  UNK  from the world to each other .
but this brings me .
they &apos;re looking for wealth from the web , through the way , like illegal dumping as the use of the  UNK  system to save money from our account when we do online criminals or with the software that we can get online information that we can get online from the computer .
it &apos;s only supported by other people talking about their mistakes .
the main reason here is what we can love to look at the great wall of the  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , but we can &apos;t do the problem of the books and the  UNK  and the  UNK
and she said she said , &quot; remember ?
the problem is this : if i can &apos;t tell you about my mistake , if i &apos;m going to shake my little voice i can tell me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit like , what i &apos;m going to
we are losing them .
it &apos;s hard to imagine .
but in this -- what i do is i &apos;m going to form this code -- the code that we have used to  UNK  it -- and i wrote my business on a piece of dna and  UNK  it to 10 times .
and despite that , it &apos;s  UNK  .
so after four years , a more  UNK   UNK  in a  UNK  , a  UNK  boat out of  UNK  .
now , how many times we spend a political leader -- and we spend a lot of energy to go to find a political leadership -- and then we sit back and hope and the government will reflect our values and our needs , but then does not have a change ?
and ending the  UNK  . &quot;
over time , we &apos;re just very few , and we think this is  UNK  .
maybe i have the right reason .
because i think the only way to understand this is actually put in the past and spend a long-term view of the animal .
and so they bring them back to a modern book .
there &apos;s a mismatch between technology and design that allows us to be human beings , when we actually pay attention to the fact that poverty , no one that is given to the status quo and injustice .
seriously .
if i was a  UNK  , i could make it into a kind of  UNK  and  UNK  it into this room .
when we don &apos;t really care about things , difficult things are affected .
so , for example , the fish gets caught up .
that &apos;s the question we &apos;re going to worry about 50 years .
eight years ago when i was in the media lab , i discovered that the idea was to be able to bring the engineer to the artists and artists .
now what about today ?
it says , &quot; this drone has the same activity in the same way that you can have a  UNK  flight . &quot; it doesn &apos;t make you feel confident ? &quot;
we &apos;re at the moment of  UNK  .
and only working in the culture of medicine is that the system is controlled by people , and when people control the system , they will have the wrong force .
so i looked at three and laughed , but she was very severe .
this is an example of how our government is using technology to fight us , the citizens of the country .
and then i went there , and i &apos;ll just listen .
the only thing that i was done was that i had changed the way that information was expressed in that .
we have here in three dimensions that are perfect , but we can all relate to life in the three-dimensional world .
but i think there &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
the conclusion that we made is the magic that we could have been replaced by machines .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not the nurses of the three months before , but as a nurse , which tells me three to the three , which i &apos;ve been  UNK  .
i started seeing a little bit more .
we say those words with  UNK  .
they were driven for other purposes -- the government , government , and sometimes it &apos;s just for fun .
in the united states , the medical institute .
we all have a  UNK  device in the car .
my mom said , &quot; why did my mother  UNK  me ? &quot;
at the high school , you also have a class where i &apos;m going to check , you know , you know , you know .
today , that number two million .
here &apos;s an example of what &apos;s going to happen when the government does .
people think that politics is compelling .
and it &apos;s true to me , and you can see it .
i live in alabama , like the other states will actually take your vote , if you &apos;re  UNK  .
they find them with government , but they don &apos;t complain , they find them .
now if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell people how they work .
i really think that in a lot of places where the poor is fair .
humans should think that it &apos;s affecting people to be sure when people in society , &quot; they kill animals , and they don &apos;t know what they did .
and a story that reflects the new issues as environmental problems .
i &apos;m going to start by showing a a  UNK  report .
we &apos;re on this straight line in the middle of the world in the world in which the world has existed in the world .
do you know how much do you make a choice ?
and i think that all of us here is part of the next generation -- that &apos;s what it is .
in our country , in the united states in the long time , there &apos;s still a death penalty , you know , you &apos;re likely to be  UNK  , and when the  UNK  is the black people who are the black ones who are the black ones who are the black ones who are the ones who are
you know , it &apos;s  UNK  , right ?
somehow we don &apos;t understand , but that little kid learned how to leave the information .
scott  UNK  .
hi everyone . i &apos;m kevin  UNK  . i &apos;m the  UNK  of the youtube , and i watch videos on youtube videos .
i was working at a hospital hospital school at this point when she was  UNK  into the emergency room of the hospital where i worked .
in a world where the video is more than two hours a day , and it &apos;s only really unique , and it can be paying attention to the way that these things .
in fact ,  UNK  is the core of my belief that the  UNK  of the
sometimes , even though , i heard the  UNK   UNK  , &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot; and sometimes she &apos;s on the wall : &quot; my grandchildren , home . &quot;
they use their hands to write their apps to help better work better .
so we all have the brain scans , because in a simple way that we don &apos;t accept these things that are actually  UNK  .
&quot; do you remember the patient for you ? &quot;
boston is not only a  UNK  .
and they discovered that the ceo had done about a mission for a week .
and yet we don &apos;t really understand the choice of it .
after three months in the refugee camp , we went to the  UNK  .
he was dying by the  UNK  .
someone told us that as normal , to build a software that would take for two years and cost about two million dollars .
and what &apos;s interesting is that when i teach my students about the american history i &apos;m telling them about slavery .
and even though i don &apos;t stand in front of me , but i can still see the people who i step back .
and the nurse was thinking about a moment and said , &quot; oh , i think she &apos;s going to be okay . &quot;
i talk a lot about these problems .
the nose from the coming from around the world .
now we see the opposite effect .
some of the typical examples of the coming from the world , the people who made the money from the  UNK  .
even the cat are watching this video .
is it a little bit about light ?
at the time , i was disappointed .
&quot; she thought it was a little kid . &quot;
a woman &apos;s london in england , and he said , &quot; oh , today i am . &quot;
a particularly interesting approach that i &apos;m still using a lot of evolution .
it has a  UNK  in the middle .
and that creates a social network around the digital collection that you get shot .
can you write something like this ?
so we have a chance to change this situation .
jimmy  UNK  is this on twitter , and then finally made this video as well as well .
in order to make a  UNK   UNK  or slower , you just take the  UNK  , and change the speed of light .
the engine ,  UNK  .
and when i heard her poetry , she  UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s nine people who were convicted from us to find an innocent  UNK  and drop out of prison .
and not even like a technology company , but the internet is better .
i &apos;m going to  UNK  this .
if people come back to the last two billion years , the earth has been so much like this , with a lot of  UNK  , that &apos;s a lot of chemicals .
they like to delay the sacrifice choice , when it comes to the best interest for themselves .
who &apos;s in in italy , and in fact , for example , the  UNK  medical care , because we meet patients .
&quot; that &apos;s going to make you , tired , and tired . &quot;
so the things that make the picture in real , i think , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve never been thinking about , the things around us in our daily lives .
this is happening with us today .
in both cases , patients are operated and fine .
over the past decade in the past , we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences when they give people a lot of choice .
and who can predict anything about this ?
and that &apos;s basically what i want to talk about .
but there are two problems with that .
and in fact , what we &apos;ve done is that human beings , we know .
this mountain mountain is actually collected by the fishermen in the times , but they go to the  UNK  .
hold them back . the  UNK  .
so they &apos;re not considered as a huge loss .
because all this technology comes from itself .
the  UNK  ratio in the united states is actually not violent crime .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even if they &apos;re living in society , because they don &apos;t trust what they existed .
in fact , you need a  UNK  , if you have a website to use the  UNK  , with a  UNK  service , which is the kind of services that you &apos;re using .
this diagnosis is not difficult .
now , the good news is that technology is helping improving a lot of the function of the government , to understand the fact that it is actually more  UNK  than the community .
and today we want to introduce this device , not just  UNK  , which is called  UNK  .
and it creates these cells -- made these cells in a billion years .
and if you do , you know , you can &apos;t tell you . it &apos;s your consumer .
now in the world of finance finance , i think one of the best examples of how to make the best choice , is that david  UNK  has to do with  UNK  .
when i was a child growing up , the future for me was a year 2000 , and every single person was going to happen in 2000 .
for example , this is a session that we did in the journal .
with her mother , life was the only mission of the mission : to leave her mom and started a new life in australia .
i would like to speak up to the  UNK  .
you can go on the web , download the design and design them .
if necessary , the service of government can help them connect , but a neighbor is a better solution and save more than the government services .
the green is , the green sea is the power , the  UNK  and the
but it doesn &apos;t just stop there .
so wait , this is my favorite project .
that &apos;s input for the government system and the election .
i wanted to draw on the daily basis of the daily life and the  UNK  of life in the  UNK  ward , the mother and the two days a day for the last day for the last 20 years , told each other day in the day , and every single one of us .
we have to increase that complexity .
we are  UNK  , and we &apos;re almost impossible to understand where we &apos;re building .
mau , the outside of me , i got a  UNK  .
we can &apos;t do that without the government , we need it to be more efficient .
in our ability to  UNK  , the earth and technology , a lot of other possibilities .
i asked to be a  UNK  . when you see the normal  UNK  , my colleague ,  UNK  the  UNK  on the side of the pain and the  UNK  surgeon .
what do i want to say ?
and here , the parts are made .
but the applications like to remind us that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just the government of government , to hire taxes and receive services .
even in the first seven days , in every day , there was a  UNK  video .
i &apos;m not reading the phone and work that i &apos;m supposed to do , is to call the doctor , and to give you an opportunity for you to meet the patient .
and what &apos;s below here is what we call the bureaucratic machine .
the fear of terror is  UNK  ,  UNK  , and death .
the  UNK  -- the big  UNK  -- as a  UNK  ,  UNK  , the the the the the the the the
in many ways , we &apos;re taught to believe that the real question is , is that people have to die because they have caused ?
and they will shine you through the rest of the book .
about race and about the question we should deserve them .
at the end , i was there in 1971 , studied  UNK  in west africa .
and so they also survive , or they die , which means that , if a community is good , all of those individuals in the community , and in a community , and they &apos;ve evolved in a positive way .
it connects these two people together .
my mission is not to be my life in the  UNK  , and my lesson is to realize that , yes , history has  UNK  us , but we &apos;ve been .
this is a very good question .
and she said , &quot; the third thing is that i promise you will never get wine . &quot;
and two days later , i went to the next room , and it was my time to ask me to my own room in her room .
it &apos;s a group of citizens who wrote a  UNK  report on the page for answering the proposal of the financial reform .
on my tv show , &quot;  UNK   UNK  , &quot; i made a habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you all the people from the medical surgeon , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah blah blah blah blah
in fact , they &apos;re much more efficient programs that i can train .
is it a little bit about the kind of detail ?
thank you very much for ted . thank you .
i don &apos;t know the  UNK  of all the  UNK  .
i know a lot of different interventions when they  UNK  the  UNK  .
moreover , we are citizens .
when they face their problems , they may not be interested in their voices .
and we lost the control of the  UNK  .
secondly , combine the photos should have the same kind of light .
it &apos;s not our burden .
if i go into a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you would think about me .
so , we &apos;re starting to rely on computers to make a difference in the design process .
i &apos;ve been trying to tell you about the justice system .
we still think it &apos;s  UNK  .
for those things , the mistake is  UNK  .
and the next process , like electricity , it seems to have a few decades .
i &apos;d like to tell you why a lot of medical projects are failing .
my father never allowed me to forget my life .
now the question i want to ask is that , if you look at these curves in this  UNK  , they don &apos;t get up forever .
in the aviation industry , we &apos;re never going to let people go , if you &apos;re going to take a plane going to take off a plane .
i think , even when you kill somebody , you &apos;re not an idiot .
thank you .
but this is called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
but things will be different , if the government can attack in the units of providing them .
what we do is we put in a machine that &apos;s going to happen in a developmental process of time .
this is the description of people .
that &apos;s what  UNK  did .
because that &apos;s where the real work works .
this process is going to move forward and become , i guess ,  UNK  is the right thing -- when a  UNK  sequence of its change .
he took a drink of beer , gave me a hug for me and sister and they gave me a beer for me .
and one of the most important things i &apos;ve learned in about this short time i &apos;m here today is ted .
because that &apos;s what you do when you &apos;re a  UNK   UNK  bear in the mountains .
although i could fit in life there .
so what &apos;s next ?
we worked at night .
and i was sitting on the train , because after she went into a stable state , she was placed in intensive care , and i hope that she was going to be .
but it &apos;s important to be an individual or a group of people who have created a  UNK  , and they share with more viewers , to make a  UNK  process .
this is actually  UNK  me .
i have a question for all of you here : when there are important things to take our hands , all of us , are we going to be a voice , or will we become a team of hands ?
and i graduated from high school is that if i remember all the time and i know , or more as possible , the more you know , &apos; i &apos;m going to be able to get the wrong problem .
and one of the things that we made me share with you a little video .
the physician , according to the notion of the way , is the people with bone marrow , from the only known as a human being , accepting it , it &apos;s not to be something wrong , but trying to learn something that &apos;s going to teach someone else .
so by combining the color , the contrast and light in the boundaries of the boundaries of the different pictures , in addition to the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  and the dust , we  UNK  the in between the different pictures and make it as if it &apos;s an image . it &apos;s an image that
ninety percent of what we &apos;re  UNK  , and the other creatures that live under the sea .
from criminals .
judge them again again .
the second animal that we see today is not because of the money for money .
right now , in alabama , there is a 98 percent of the black men in the  UNK  .
and i mention this because i think it &apos;s really important .
and it &apos;s always a lot of conflict in the family .
it spread viral .
nature , i found myself as a technology .
UNK  .
now i think this is going to be difficult .
in my stomach , not only i wrote it , but i sent it to the supreme court .
and in fact , i turned into a character in the book .
the  UNK  and the  UNK  .
we &apos;re very poor .
and so it gives us a big question .
and we found that the more we were coming out , actually , less .
i don &apos;t believe it .
those people came up and said to me , &quot; mr.  UNK  , you &apos;ve got these talks , but talk to talk to people , don &apos;t tell us that we &apos;re just  UNK  with the first time in the history of history .
and the problem is .
so what i want to talk about is that the body is that the body is the stage that we &apos;re experiencing .
why do people use average 15 to 30 percent when they use the  UNK  or  UNK  ?
and so , it &apos;s driving itself .
i have here 100 miles of white flour , which i tend to try to try to protect the security guard at the airport .
personally , i don &apos;t accept this , that the  UNK  that build the modern age of  UNK  , so i decided to change it .
we &apos;re moving forward , we &apos;re moving towards a world where the natural power is closer to the technology , and the magic and technology can be closer together .
and so , we didn &apos;t understand how that means .
and what we found is that there is a correlation .
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; well , we &apos;re trying to change injustice .
the more choice , the more people they get all of their money into the financial markets .
and each of you can be at home at your blood pressure and then send the data that i can share with others , and it &apos;s more than 100 dollars .
it shows how the government can work better -- unlike the private companies , like many people think .
and a map is open .
so , in other words , the future seems to be a year for every year .
so , apply this story into my medical world , a much more difficult topic to me , which is perhaps a little bit more quickly than what i &apos;m going to show you .
do you have a sense of choice you want to spend about nine minutes ?
like here , we have  UNK   UNK  from the city , ukraine .
it &apos;s a  UNK  bracket , and it &apos;s dark .
he rides his money to the  UNK  .
we need to find ways to confront the challenges , but the problem and the  UNK  places .
because there are billions of transistors .
in other words , i figured out what i wanted .
in fact , one of the things i &apos;ve been trying to do is that we can now make a lot of these things .
i actually learned this from my grandmother .
and i went back to work .
it just taught me very simple things .
it knows how we &apos;re holding it .
and he creates a  UNK  .
and my mission when i was the director of the emergency room , i went to find a patient &apos;s office .
what can we help you ? &quot;
it &apos;s a jigsaw puzzle game .
this is  UNK  .
so they wanted to kill it for beef .
this is the diagram of that .
so before i went to the room , and i was angry , and they were frustrated about how we talked about , about the poor , and about injustice .
last year , we had a team of three people working in a  UNK  project and a half a year .
i learned something very simple when i do my job .
and after about nine days , they left her -- she  UNK  , the mother , and her grandmother .
and so , i think this picture of what it means that if you look at it with a few billion years .
and this boat , it &apos;s pretty bad , called  UNK  .
he always looked through the window , and he could listen to all the  UNK  .
i went and started treatment for her .
so in those plans , we &apos;ve got a  UNK  plan , from the people from the  UNK  from each other .
they use  UNK  activities to make lots of money , lots of money .
three mothers are actually a  UNK  .
and in a couple of years , the lego bricks were at home .
have you ever seen these people ?
for example , we &apos;re going to spend a million dollars for dinner in the next five years . yes , a million dollars .
the idea that  UNK  fireflies in the glass , doesn &apos;t know why , it &apos;s very interesting to me .
and they don &apos;t tell us a lot .
and my patient is not a big ; it &apos;s not every time they all  UNK  the same way .
i used it to do the survey across the southern south of the south of china and two  UNK  .
if you think the image on the left is  UNK  , and you have to be jazz , you know .
but we &apos;re taking a very complicated thing , turning it into a  UNK  , a  UNK  , and forms of people in the brain .
or it &apos;s going to turn into a kind of curve like this , until something different is happening , or maybe , it &apos;s going to turn into this .
this is not a problem between privacy and security .
innovation , creativity , and development is not only from the idea of our minds .
but the key thing is that creativity is that it &apos;s inspiring in this culture culture .
the lunch is coming up close , and i think i &apos;m going to pause here , before i &apos;m kind of  UNK  .
privacy is supposed to be sure .
do you want to go ? &quot;
he &apos;s got a disease that could be dangerous .
she &apos;s  UNK  , but also .
it &apos;s very busy , i &apos;m asking .
for every time , she  UNK  would call it and said , &quot; hey ,  UNK  , the park will come to town , and we will come to talk .
there &apos;s something weird here .
in this country , i  UNK  people in canada , because of medicine can be able to avoid .
and he &apos;s just talking about the crowd of every day , the camera goes back .
even though , we seem to feel comfortable about this .
so let &apos;s help us do this and not just to better health and better control .
and we all feel some of our own cultural culture .
what is the new state of the world in the world ?
so the western governments are providing the government to  UNK  governments to fight their people .
my second mistake is worse .
and yes , my mother &apos;s just here today in the fourth row .
this is a short video that shows what we &apos;re doing .
now we have accelerated the time frame again .
and i think that opportunity is always around us .
this is  UNK   UNK  from  UNK  ,  UNK  .
she said , &quot; well , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re not going to do that . &quot;
the question of death is this very interesting thing .
and these two pictures are also  UNK  both in the same time and the same kind of light .
and in fact , most of these are very small ones that are  UNK  crystals in  UNK  , or  UNK  , are the ones that live in coral reefs .
and in two or three days later , everything was never going to be .
that &apos;s what happens .
so i want to give three basic principles that needs to follow the results .
because of the protected areas like that we &apos;re actually doing the past .
so , for example , how do you work , or why the  UNK  of  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  the  UNK  response .
and you don &apos;t claim a society by the way that they treat the rich people , who have power and people who are  UNK  in the way that they treat the poor , the people who have to me .
they seem to look like this .
and then finally i decided i &apos;m going to go to the supreme court , and it &apos;s a difficult case .
and why , today , children don &apos;t do it anymore .
on the other hand , it &apos;s also used to pull people out of the chair sitting together with some of the games better than their health .
i &apos;m just showing it the puzzle of the reality where you can take the different parts of the reality and the group of them together to create a reality .
the storytelling is becoming  UNK  .
they were there in february .
and so i jumped in , i jumped into this technology , to see how i could use it to make it , rather than harming it .
michael tilson  UNK  from the science fiction is one of the first one of a video of video on twitter .
that &apos;s our vision of technology and design , entertainment and creativity has always been  UNK  with the vision of the community , compassion and justice .
and she said , &quot; do you get it ? &quot;
there &apos;s something in me .
in a hospital system where the medical knowledge has doubled two or three years , we can &apos;t .
they sell them .
we &apos;ve been working in a system that has happened in every single day , in the old days of 10 dollars , or whether it &apos;s a  UNK  or a  UNK  ,  UNK  , from the  UNK  of the
and if i say , &quot; skin , &quot; i &apos;m going to &quot; &quot; attack , &quot; and if i said , &quot; my skin , &quot; she will let me alone .
but another thing .
you give a  UNK  in the middle , and now you can come to me .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here , in the explosion of this curve .
as most people on the boat , my mother took a small bottle .
and so , it &apos;s a big role that the  UNK  can .
i really think that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
let me show you how it works .
and among them , there &apos;s only a  UNK  ratio , getting a lot of views , and become a cultural phenomenon .
it &apos;s actually a combination of different realities .
just because they don &apos;t know it .
this is the center of information and communication .
UNK   UNK  , a great  UNK  ,  UNK  , said about this .
they use their hands .
they have over 75 different types of  UNK  oils , including these kinds of  UNK  in their own  UNK  .
for me , it means for time to think about , to talk about the poor , people who are difficult , for those who don &apos;t have come to ted .
what about people who can &apos;t do that ? because they don &apos;t have access to -- but in the west ?
words , through the last year , you know , you &apos;re  UNK  with him .
we &apos;re having a system that &apos;s going to be willing to treat you so much better if you &apos;re committed to poor people who are poor .
and it &apos;s kind of new technology that are creating miracles , not to kill it .
failure will be easy .
it knows where we are .
you can say that concrete  UNK  became the  UNK  .
today there is a large community of people who build the tools that we need to work together .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened to  UNK  .
that means that falls into the field , it goes down , it &apos;s not arrested , and the team you want to throw it back to the first thing that &apos;s not going to run and i &apos;m safe .
we &apos;re using these programs to create a computer faster so that we can make it faster .
he goes into silence .
for the poor , the people of the , the the people that they have to have to live with a  UNK  .
but our lives are much more than we have in our memories .
instead of being able to code , where you teach or  UNK  ,  UNK  allows you to code with simple  UNK  .
here , these are  UNK  .
the shore is a different place .
and so , we humans have to be  UNK  .
this is the  UNK  of the gulf .
UNK  is a company provider provider .
and you can talk about a lot of things in the world .
and these people know that we didn &apos;t have to focus on it .
he goes to go back .
at a few moments , a little piece of  UNK  and down to me -- and the ipad -- you know , you know , little gps -- the letter sent to my address .
when i talk about authenticity , i mean , authenticity .
we have a couple of candidates that year , they will work with the city of the city .
and they count the  UNK  in evolution .
it &apos;s not like the suburbs of the middle class , but i don &apos;t know that there is no , there &apos;s no current state in  UNK  .
and if you think this is kind of weird , you should know that there &apos;s three hours of three million views .
i walked into the car , in a sense of feeling .
it &apos;s really important .
UNK   UNK  , and then go home .
i fear that i went to  UNK  .
i had to have a long time in prison , after living and fish in prison prison .
now i &apos;m going to warn you that we have to be able to have a lot of challenges , when we don &apos;t pay attention .
this allows us to start as a living organism .
it &apos;s trying to confront the bias and discrimination in the  UNK  .
just sharing the experience with others .
the next process , like language and the same thing , happens in less than a million years .
1,000 , wonderful .
the more process changed the speed , it &apos;s faster .
we &apos;ve been working hard to talk about race , i believe that , because we &apos;re not willing to lose the truth and reconciliation .
at a time , your screen is .
27 years after i went back , the size of this fish was only half .
i don &apos;t apply the same anymore .
this story is not finished .
we &apos;re taking solar power .
when i say my  UNK  , she looked at me and said , &quot; well , um . &quot;
i believe that is true for everyone on earth .
but one of them , if you &apos;re lucky , will put two zeros in the right place .
if i had to go into a room full of my colleagues and remember them , and i started telling you what i was telling you , i would never tell you two things before they see it , and they &apos;ll be able to talk about it .
in fact , you &apos;ve got a lot of information about the first time , and then the second time , but i &apos;ll guess that you feel it in the second time .
what we do is that they do , even if i went into the world with  UNK  , to be perfect .
and while we still believe in the right now , right here , in this year , it &apos;s all of us that we are losing all the better things .
so i went through my  UNK  .
the next process is happening in these populations .
my name is brian .
thank you .
in both cases , i don &apos;t wait for the patients , and i don &apos;t think of care .
we &apos;re seeing some very interesting development in our jobs .
in every morning i stood up .
the result is now more than a  UNK  version of &quot;  UNK  &quot; on youtube .
so i &apos;m talking about the youth unemployment and education , and about people who are  UNK  ,  UNK  .
this is a conference where there are people in the future , and people can notice that the future is spinning around in 2000 .
and of course she thinks what we need to commit .
and the oil was supposed to support the husband of her husband , she was a  UNK  , when he was , and he was a little bit more .
but every time , they all  UNK  me , and i looked at me .
and i think what we see is that , if you &apos;re a teacher , your words will be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a rich teacher , you have a meaning of compassion .
i had a very privileged privilege , when i was a teenager , i met the  UNK  .
and here you &apos;ll see , along with some  UNK  , paper and the water ,  UNK  did .
so , for example , the resistance of antibiotics is made .
UNK  is  UNK  electronics .
and put the  UNK  index .
but then there &apos;s another stage , it &apos;s a very interesting moment when things become completely different , and that &apos;s where these cells begin to communicate and communicate information , and they form a community of cells .
i don &apos;t know how to use  UNK  .
we &apos;re taking off .
and said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do ? &quot;
and the premise that seems to be for a moment until i met her  UNK  .
UNK  ,  UNK  !
and the english  UNK  in the conversation between people who have a common point , they &apos;re starting .
the baseball is  UNK  .
this sounds strange , but i &apos;m a  UNK  fan of concrete .
and what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
this is my first  UNK  .
i was very , very , very similar .
so this is the open project .
so i &apos;d like to make a difference , something in the beginning of the beginning .
and we have this idea that if we get people to make mistakes out of the medicine , which is simply a safe system .
i went into the car and then went to court .
not in a scientific way -- she put a coffee cup or a cup of tea and asked her patient , family and relatives , &quot; what &apos;s going on ?
he walked into the room and sit behind me , very close to you .
this is an example of the project that they did , the gun  UNK   UNK  .
well , i love my mom , so i promised , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
so you don &apos;t lose the animals .
so , in the back of this  UNK  , you have to go out , and , in a chapter , photographed a  UNK  and  UNK  it .
and the oil droplet as if they began to divide and divide .
so the  UNK  tends to be much longer .
and that &apos;s when i made the first mistake ; i gave three  UNK  .
and since i was too late , i didn &apos;t think of a system , so i started writing a petition .
they &apos;re coming out of ideas that are  UNK  by the heart of the heart .
my hobby of photography i started when i had a video camera at 15 .
so how does this happen ?
if we want the government to work for us , we have to make that system .
i have now a new generation of programs that are produced by the combination of programs that make a better job .
but , but , you know ?
UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  . &quot;
i went from my  UNK  , that was a 13-year-old boy , 14 years old , and he was allowed to be in front of the same as a adults .
what does this mean ?
it could be working on fire ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , a  UNK  rat .
so it &apos;s actually a little bit more idea than having a moment .
and i kept asking myself .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t  UNK  in the law .
well , when i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
it &apos;s something deeply deeply embedded in the human part of the people , i think about the contribution of people to the community , for the thinking of hope .
in other words , every single one here represents a level of a month .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to have an interactive activity that you &apos;re going to do with the video of the video and the technology of augmented reality , you see this  UNK   UNK  on the outside of your house .
this is a  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
at the end of the day , i went up to the hospital , and i went to and i went back to the car , to get back to my house , and i was doing something that i didn &apos;t do .
so half of the customers went from a lot of choices , to  UNK  the car , i four choices , four engines .
it &apos;s completely wrong .
you know , the average of grocery stores today gives you a product .
and that &apos;s my message when i learned to school .
and what &apos;s interesting is that this page is , it &apos;s like a lot of pages of technology that is familiar with us , is a kind of a straight line on a  UNK  curve .
let me tell you about some pieces .
in the world , i was in the  UNK  of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  violence , heroin and  UNK  .
and the first thing i did was to ask those people who said , &quot; tell me how different choices are .
i gave her  UNK  . i had a drug to reduce the activity of the heart .
and what i learned is that the error is everywhere .
this is my electronics . it &apos;s a very simple device .
a lot of my cave is still very small .
and this starts with a  UNK  .
next , if you can catch this page .
well , why not ?
we &apos;ve got some great speech .
after nearly 100 years , in 1947 , this was introduced .
i think if someone is lying , they &apos;re not a liar .
the child in me was fascinated by these possibilities .
our country , it has been so much about 40 years ago .
it &apos;s all .
it &apos;s a rich , not that i don &apos;t have any impact on the outcome .
do you know how many of you have a choice in a week ?
we &apos;re seeing this process from pushing ourselves .
they sold these tools for the government to the  UNK  .
if you &apos;re having a suspicion , there &apos;s a certain amount of crime , it &apos;s probably your phone . &quot;
the next piece of the picture is a boat in the  UNK   UNK  .
so now , evolution can happen in a few seconds .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you a lesson that i have with  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , which is where we look at the  UNK  decisions of almost a million people in the u.s.
in the funding plans for 60 percent of the financial population growth .
in both cases , these are all kinds of  UNK  , in fact , because in fact , we don &apos;t have any of this problem that we should have .
and that means 10 times the ball , it &apos;s a  UNK  ,  UNK  .
first .
they have 250  UNK  and  UNK  and different types of fruits and vegetables , and more than two different countries , and that &apos;s the time we &apos;re actually going to drink .
so the first principle is that combination of the images should have a  UNK  .
my mother was now with me when i was on the boat .
and the only country in the world is doing this .
and i went back to work in the clinic .
in a few moments in the book , it will show you the secret in it .
but in fact , nobody knows that in a good surgeon , or a surgeon , to be .
and i made the kids who were  UNK  .
now there &apos;s a lot of people who believe in government .
but today that oil doesn &apos;t really exist , as we say , right now , because all of them is the random recipe of chemicals .
i &apos;ve never met him outside .
and the dynamics of this  UNK  is very simple and understandable .
there was a time i came up and listen to them after a few hours , she went back to the morning and she said , &quot; well ,  UNK  , let me tell me about  UNK   UNK  .
so the lesson i &apos;ve done with  UNK   UNK  and  UNK   UNK  , and we &apos;ve done a  UNK  with the people who  UNK  in  UNK  , and now those who have been in a period of time they can  UNK  plan .
they wanted to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t go into my  UNK  . &quot;
but i &apos;m still going to say , i &apos;m 52 , and i admit that i &apos;ve never had a drink of wine .
these kinds of things they don &apos;t consume , they &apos;re  UNK  , because they died .
and she took me out of the room , out behind the house and said , &quot; hey , hey , i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going to tell you . &quot;
what do you do with that ?
you have over 60 different decisions , to finish your car .
this is a report on the analysis of analysis that we &apos;re working on the power of the power of the processor with the power of the power .
he was the poet , the playwright , a man who had a  UNK  life on the only hope that his country would be free .
the skin cells are not going to work without the presence of the heart , the brain cells , cells , and a lot of cells .
recently , i &apos;ve been working on over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choice that americans have done is about 70 times in a day .
a few years ago i began to develop  UNK  .
all the tricks that i showed you today is designed to help you control your choices , and you can apply your own friends to serve .
and i think about this .
they &apos;re six hours after her home , after i gave her home home , three brothers and her family  UNK  and her father and she took her back to the emergency room , and it was just 50 .
one or two hours later , if i met her three to come up and said , &quot;  UNK  , you still feel like you ? &quot;
today , we can do it with a  UNK  and machine .
in the &apos; 70s -- oh , no , starting from the &apos; 60s -- europe , a lot of projects .
we &apos;ve been able to reinvent the past that people can &apos;t perceive it because of the  UNK   UNK  , and  UNK  at the bottom .
one of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re going to go on a tour journey in which you have to go out of the camera and the pictures of different objects .
they even use tools like  UNK   UNK  to  UNK  your computer , and then they can get all the information that you exchange , you get the conversation through your network , and you get your password .
the first story about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
but that &apos;s the best thing that might be done because this is called the pressure of pressure , the pressure that has been used for patients -- since it &apos;s used to obesity , it can also be used for patients .
the  UNK  in the united states are identified .
and we , in the west can &apos;t understand why these things can be true , but that &apos;s the enemy of the freedom of speech .
the shape is a piece .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
the other thing that &apos;s really important to me is to create the actual content that is modern .
i don &apos;t know .
and &quot; she &apos;s his answer .
and in this case , a neighbor has seen .
this is sea in this case from the sea , or the soft  UNK  , a soft mess .
but somehow we get ourselves from this problem .
because it doesn &apos;t look like it .
people are helping each other , but the government has the core role here .
and she said , &quot; you can only do with three three things ,  UNK  . &quot;
the pictures where you would need a little bit of thinking to find a secret .
there &apos;s always a start with a sketch , an idea .
what do you think you &apos;re in the management of the options ?
and it &apos;s almost like a reaction in the mind , as the antibody starts to attack .
we gave  UNK  children and see them playing with  UNK  .
