i grew up in the country of war .
she took a whole week for a week , and they were  UNK  .
of course , it &apos;s pretty good at africa .
i took this device in two years ago , and i was there , and we didn &apos;t have the lions .
i was always taking pictures of the camera .
and i suddenly understood that one of the most important things that we &apos;ve created is our memory .
but now , 50 years later , we can go back to a million years , and not only one of a billionth of a second , or a billionth of a second , but in a billion seconds , we &apos;ll see the world .
otherwise they won &apos;t come to you .
i don &apos;t know , as a  UNK  of my hometown of my hometown of my future , but i realized that the life was filled with a lot of misery , even because of the refugees were killed by illegal immigrants .
tell us why , you know , science is related to us .
UNK  and  UNK  with them , and they &apos;re doing it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again .
and you can see , here &apos;s a air , it &apos;s in it .
so we &apos;re going to be a little bit more robust , and the of the , the the , the , , we , , , , , , , , , , , , , we , , , , , , ,
we can also live in the world with the people who live in north korea , because we &apos;re all connected to live in the north korea , and we &apos;re going to go back and forth .
150 years ago , a  UNK  price of three times more than one of the u.s.
so this light is going to fall into the lion , and they think that i &apos;m walking around , but actually , in fact , i &apos;m working on my bed .
and what we found is that they would travel in different countries , so if you just focus on a region , you &apos;re very hard .
now , like  UNK   UNK  , a scientist , science became an art , a kind of  UNK   UNK  , and i realized that we had a lot of data that we had collected , not just a scientific imaging , and it was a new kind of computational  UNK  interface , and in this case , of course
there are so many of the valleys that we don &apos;t have , and we &apos;re very surprised .
the  UNK  activities are the most healthy and emotional activity , especially in the middle of the inner city .
and they don &apos;t want to talk to them , and they don &apos;t want to tell you what they &apos;re going to do when they &apos;re spending their money .
so there &apos;s a second approach : using  UNK  .
so back to my question : why am i going to be ?
so to address this problem , we think about self-assembly .
they don &apos;t know .
you can &apos;t imagine how cool it is , and it &apos;s going to affect the impact .
and the other thing that happened was , it was kind of ridiculous , and it was kind of ridiculous -- oh , it was kind of weird to me .
we tend to be victims of the victims of  UNK  ,  UNK  women , as the headlines in the news .
and it &apos;s going to be a little bit more  UNK  , and more and more .
i didn &apos;t know that he was being tortured .
he went from a  UNK  .
now , of course , people are not interested in , so we pay a salary for them , and they &apos;re also a little bit of a
how about the  UNK  of the  UNK  ?
and the board is that i did last year , and then i got a lot of people in my community to say , in a community , and so that my colleagues did this , and so my colleagues did a small toolbox , which is that the wall has moved around the globe .
but the amazing thing is , you know , parkinson &apos;s disease and other diseases , and you don &apos;t have to be able to do that , and the best that we can do , is ,
i got the opportunity to go to ted , and this is my first time .
and over the last 28 years , i &apos;ve been photographing this country in the  UNK  of the european countries , and , in , , , , , , , , , , , , to
and we said , &quot; oh my gosh ! &quot;
i hope that doesn &apos;t seem like that .
and we &apos;ve created a space and an idea of thinking and thinking about what we &apos;re growing up in the process of changing .
you can &apos;t stop transmission of disease .
we have the  UNK  in the world .
and i &apos;m going to answer the question that people often ask me questions that i &apos;m going to ask questions .
that &apos;s the  UNK  , listen to them . &quot;
and the reason i decided to leave , because the last time i had a  UNK  , i had a .
but today , afghanistan has been more than 300 million .
every time i was in a hurry , i felt that new orleans came up with a protest .
in fact , there was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of new york city .
because they couldn &apos;t keep the natural resources .
what can you do ? well , you can act together , and you can write your government and tell them that we need to look at them .
well , the truth is , in a friday night , he told me that he quit his job , and he said , because he said , because he was the fact that he was because i was he quit my father , and i didn &apos;t have to go to the back of the city , and
all around the globe , beyond the age , we have some of the most basic needs , right ?
they &apos;re not born .
but what makes me sad is that even if it &apos;s true , even though they &apos;re not as a normal person , it &apos;s just one thing that &apos;s remarkable , but it &apos;s extraordinary .
i even took my friends back to my community , helping them to install them in the house , and how they did it .
the first principle of aid is to respect .
and if you &apos;ve ever wondered , if i &apos;ve got to be better , i &apos;m happier , i &apos;m happier ?
but when i go back to afghanistan and see my students and support their parents , i see the hope for the future , and i saw this change .
we &apos;re  UNK  ,  UNK  .
it &apos;s more than 5,000 more than 5,000 years old , and he  UNK  , and the largest economy in the world .
and you &apos;re going to do another one ?
politicians don &apos;t choose to make sense of  UNK  and control reality , but in fact , the reality is changing the reality of change .
and today i &apos;ve been a proud of  UNK  college .
we &apos;re always going to talk about death death , even though i think about death , but i realize that this is one of the most powerful things that we can do .
on the left , you see our  UNK  camera .
this is not a  UNK  .
and at the end of our conversation , i felt really bad , and it was a bad idea for me , and it seemed to me that i didn &apos;t know anything about it , and i don &apos;t know how many people don &apos;t know ?
and with your children , your colleagues , your friends and your family and talk about it .
he doesn &apos;t want to look like other babies , and in fact , he &apos;s not interested in me .
it &apos;s kind of like  UNK  .
i still live in silence .
it means that patients can do it .
and what &apos;s shocking is that it &apos;s more than a billion dollars in the global economy .
and i saw young people who wanted to work , but they were happy to spend a lot of time , and i look at the different color of my skin , and they were always going to be on the road , and they
thank you .
i &apos;d like to get the lions to get them down to me .
so this is one of the cows in the night , and i found it in the morning in the morning , and it was dead , because it was my  UNK  .
UNK  is our nature &apos;s  UNK  .
i refused to become a part of that part of my life , and i &apos;m going to create my own reality .
and the secret is that i used to be , and i thought that i was a man with my soul , and i put it with a gun gun , and i had a lot of it .
he was looking at me , but fortunately , he believed me .
i didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , the whole wall was filled with a new answer .
and i said , &quot; the police , neighbors , neighbors , my friends and family , and i &apos;m standing here today , because i &apos;ve got to help me .
and i was very lucky , because it was invented by the invention of kenya , which was the best school in kenya , and i was very excited about this .
now , the beam goes into the bottle , which is our bullet , through the bottle , and in the inside .
you put a  UNK  in a car .
it &apos;s going to be  UNK  .
so the last question is , &quot; what does it look like ? &quot;
but now , do you know how many countries have president ?
&quot; before the dead tree . &quot;
in the taliban control of the taliban to go to school , there was only a couple of people -- don &apos;t forget , it was illegal .
see , i &apos;m an artist .
and this is an important lesson that i think you can learn , and i want to leave you with you .
and so we started with , and he liked to me , like my smart , and i was at harvard , and i was giving my teenage girls , and my job .
one of them was the grandmother .
i just want to say a word for you , and i don &apos;t have to say to you .
it turns out that the domestic violence in the  UNK  and  UNK  , the odds that are going to
and this is 16 years old , and it &apos;s also  UNK  .
and then , at that time , they were able to take them back to the photos of this photograph , and of course , depending on the  UNK  .
we have a  UNK  that &apos;s beautiful . in italy , it &apos;s big , big , big , in zambia .
her two sons , though , has been a lot of school , but in two different schools .
it &apos;s more like a restaurant .
those are the kids who are more than the kids who are  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  clothes ,  UNK  clothes .
there &apos;s a  UNK  behind the wall , and we &apos;re going to
there are over 500 million volunteers who helped us to 90 percent of the family members of the family , and these photos are completely  UNK  .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
it &apos;s the most important thing to be .
why ? because the tomatoes are  UNK  , and they &apos;re in the , and , , a , a ,
i don &apos;t know how to do that .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to do something completely . &quot;
so i &apos;d like to share with this kind of spontaneous and conscious mind .
and what i did for this talk , i found out that there was a percent of the women in the united states , and in their 40s , they were 17 percent .
and if you go on this road , you &apos;re going to take these  UNK  -- that &apos;s what we see .
and they &apos;re all addicts warriors , and they are protecting our families and livestock , but they &apos;re also frustrated with this question .
this book was published in 2009 .
there &apos;s a possibility of  UNK  .
if i had any  UNK  , i was going to go back and went back .
the value of today is about the value of the people who are creating value , but the value of value .
it &apos;s going to be .
and this is going to make light .
i used to have one of the people that i had .
at the time , what i didn &apos;t want to do was to leave the new york , and i had to work with my soul , but i wanted to do sacrifices , so i thought i needed to do sacrifices , so i agree , quit my job , and i went to the manhattan .
i was with a very good friend , and i got married , three children .
i don &apos;t look like a  UNK  domestic victim .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to be a  UNK  . &quot;
but they &apos;ll kill you , you &apos;re not happy .
i had a  UNK  in cambridge in cambridge , and i went to a store and bought it , and they gave me a dress .
most of them ended up in their hands , and it &apos;s very important .
i think the answer lies in the problem .
we need to deal with the government .
well , sadly , the nervous system , for example , for example , for example , as a result of  UNK  , it &apos;s going to happen in my friend  UNK   UNK  , who is his  UNK   UNK  .
look at how we can make a difference in africa .
they burn it in  UNK  , and then they put it into the  UNK  , and into the  UNK  , , , , , , ,
now she went to new york city , because she decided to go to new york .
and so , he dreamed of being able to resist the freedom of freedom , and in this case , in this case , to educate the education , is to me , to
but if they &apos;re not interested , what do you do ?
otherwise , in this photograph , she &apos;s not going to be completely  UNK  , and we all have to put together all the pieces together into a good picture , and then make this picture .
you know , it &apos;s probably going to happen .
i was thrown out twice .
each one of them is very dark in the wall , and there &apos;s a number of numbers and  UNK  .
i used to hate lions , but now , this is because my invention of my father &apos;s brother and the lions , we were able to lions .
but when these things don &apos;t look at children , if they don &apos;t have a sense of food , how they affect people &apos;s body and their body , they just don &apos;t eat any food .
and , of course , it has weaknesses , and it &apos;s not going to be  UNK  .
and the great  UNK  of the  UNK  are always  UNK  , and i , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .
and we said , &quot; we can travel around the world and creative , creative , working together . &quot;
thank you .
this person doesn &apos;t exist .
the gun was a clear signal for me , although he didn &apos;t take a gun , and i didn &apos;t have the edges of the danger of danger .
at the time , i was dr. dr. robicsek , and i tried it , and i was able to
but the third thing you can understand , and it &apos;s also very important , and i want to leave you with this one , which is the end of this , the  UNK  of the federal government , the  UNK  of the
and these signs indicate that , if we could have a sense of self , and the opportunity to share with the opportunity to share with the public spaces , and the public space is going to make a huge difference .
in south asia , some of the countries like india and pakistan , which is , in fact , is that they &apos;re going to go extinct in the next 15 years , and it &apos;s because they &apos;ve been killed by the  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
&quot; i &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
so this is how we can put some  UNK  on the door .
and shortly after that , i went to a group of volunteers who was volunteers in the group of volunteers , just in a few days , just in a few days .
we saw the symptoms .
so if the photographer is here , here &apos;s the light here -- the beautiful  UNK  says , &quot; well , i want to take a walk out of a walk , and i &apos;m going to take a walk out of it , and that &apos;s the arm , and the and the , , and , ,
&quot; if you think , &quot; now you can kill me . &quot; he said , &quot; but i &apos;m not going to give you a sense of my mind and my daughter &apos;s future . &quot;
and the people who work here are usually  UNK  .
so what do they do with this kind of test , and how do they do with a professional clinical trial ?
in fact , i &apos;m going to make it cool , and i &apos;m going to show you how to fix it .
and  UNK  told me that you &apos;re looking at  UNK  , and i &apos;m going to tell you about it , because it &apos;s very important to understand that it &apos;s very important to recognize and treat .
so now there &apos;s some  UNK  in the  UNK  .
like me , they have a lot of dreams .
i grew up there , and i grew up with my son .
why did they feel that ?
UNK  is something that we &apos;ve heard about when we hear a lot about it , because global warming , i &apos;ve been quoted to say , &quot; if i &apos;m going to take it out of this industry , it &apos;s going to be hard to get it . &quot;
&quot; well , we hope , &quot; oh my god , you can go to the room where you can get paid . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i think it &apos;s a life . &quot;
and this is exactly the same response .
so i took a different one .
in afghanistan , you can create a lot of wonderful things in the art , but i don &apos;t want to paint myself , but i don &apos;t want to be able to create the work of , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to a ,
so after five years , i went to my sister , and i was my sister to go to a secret school , which was not allowed to be interrupted .
and they put me out . it &apos;s a miracle .
and i was very , very , very , very  UNK  .
you just take a look at the models , because they have the most  UNK  hair , the most beautiful clothes , the most beautiful clothes , and they &apos;re probably the best woman in the world .
find a new technology , a new technology , it &apos;s a lot .
i &apos;m not a citizen citizen .
i didn &apos;t want to be able to do these beautiful , but it wasn &apos;t the people that i was able to .
i &apos;m just a woman who has to talk about .
how are we going to intervene in these  UNK  , but what is common ?
we &apos;re always worried about the taliban .
and it makes me feel bad , and i tell them that you don &apos;t have to take food like this .
and for me , i had to wait to go back to my heart .
this is a picture of a couple of months ago .
my father was playing with his  UNK  , and he was listening to the news .
but my mother had become a teacher .
this is  UNK  , as i said , rock , there &apos;s a little  UNK  .
now i &apos;m 22 .
he was thrown out of london in london , but he was very brave , and he had a courageous courage to parliament , and he ended up having a support for the support of his own voice .
and what i found out is that the americans can see us in our lives .
for instance ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s almost no  UNK  .
they &apos;re all victims of violence .
you can help a  UNK   UNK  .
and the other organizations are starting to have a  UNK  garden .
you think , why would you like  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  ? &quot;
i &apos;d like to take a look at what &apos;s called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; and in a department of an emergency police station in the streets of afghanistan , and put it in the streets of the  UNK  , and instead of giving them a bribe , and give them to the name of the police , and
the reality is , when you graduate , you &apos;ve got a job interview , and you can &apos;t go anywhere else , so if you say , you want to be the president of the united states , and you say , you &apos;ve got to come up with you , you know , you &apos;ve got to
so , we take the seeds of the italian south , the  UNK  , a beautiful ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , and we , ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and . .
as you can see , this is  UNK  , because lions are coming from there .
so we can build a community , and in this community , we &apos;ve got from the  UNK  background in a cafe , in a bar , in a bar , and you can give you a  UNK  , to help us with you , and we &apos;re going to ask you , &quot; what do you need ?
these light will bounce into the room , and then go back to the door , and then go into the camera , so we can use these light .
some of them were actually saying , &quot; this is her fault , &quot; it was like a victim of being  UNK  and  UNK  .
first of all , it &apos;s my favorite place , and all of the things i &apos;ve ever found , i &apos;ve been able to find out of the senate , never before .
now , i &apos;m kind of a little uncomfortable in this room , because i shouldn &apos;t wear this dress .
when we walked into a community , we wouldn &apos;t have any idea of to each other , but connected with them .
and i thought , i was just a very short time with my family .
now , there &apos;s a lot of going to happen here , so let me show you .
when i was three , my brother was born , i was very excited about my family .
you can be extraordinary .
our people who believe that we are carrying our animals and our homes and our lives and our lives , and that &apos;s why we value them .
and as he grew up , he became more apparent , and it became apparent .
and she started to take her photographs , until she realizes that she had a lot of damage .
it &apos;s a community of passionate people . you &apos;re clapping for them .
but something interesting is happening .
and you should look at the garbage -- -- you should look at how many of the things that we put in the african people .
so in the city , they &apos;re sitting together and they want to talk about los angeles , and what it means is that it &apos;s going to take a look at what &apos;s going on in the south bronx , and it &apos;s kind of going to come up with the real problem .
over 70 percent of domestic violence is happening at the end of the victim , and after she left , because it &apos;s been  UNK  .
in particular , this is a picture of the  UNK  lady , and to the , and , a , a little baby , and a , a , a , , and my , my , my mother , my mother , my mother , my mother , my mother , and my
the restaurant is a place where people are being used to be  UNK  .
what &apos;s the problem ?
each one of these cases is specific , and it &apos;s different .
recently , the new york times reported about 10 million children per year in the united states every year .
in the  UNK  myth , the  UNK   UNK   UNK  , he  UNK  his life to the  UNK  , to the the .
my first answer is , &quot; i don &apos;t know , because they don &apos;t let me do it . &quot;
sensing can be heated , and it &apos;s very good at  UNK  .
this is the time that we &apos;ve spent our time , and it &apos;s one of the most hopeful time that we have .
but i had no idea that i was 14 years old .
today , i &apos;d like to talk about a very disconcerting question , the answer to the question .
yeah , yeah . so , in this case , you have to tell us whether you have this disease .
the first was that he graduated from graduate school , and in a very good wall street bank .
well , it &apos;s not going to be like this .
we &apos;re trying to figure out the relationship between the relationship and the relationship of the environment .
it &apos;s a  UNK  and  UNK  .
but lions are very clever .
you &apos;re going to read it .
and the kindness of the stranger was me and the most hopeful hope for me and the most needed . he made me realize that strangers , and the support of our society and the support of the society that we would need to be .
it should be the first principles of aid .
they are entrepreneurs , they are fighting for them .
how are we going to be able to share a better understanding of our buildings and to better understand what we live in ?
so , in fact , they thought , this kind of  UNK  technology is going to be in new york .
there &apos;s only one  UNK  : i &apos;m walking through the staircase .
we are a free organization , and it &apos;s all the different from the different cities , and all of us are all volunteers .
and i thought , &quot; what ? &quot;
he  UNK  his love with his love .
they &apos;re just one of the time that we spend time in the last 10 months , and let &apos;s look back and forth , and how we &apos;re going to change over the years , and it &apos;s not changed .
this is l.a. .
i &apos;m here today because i &apos;m a model .
why ? because they look at the curve on the graph , and if the population continues to grow in the speed of new york , they &apos;re going to need six million pounds of water , and they &apos;re going to be
i &apos;m going to question it . you know why ?
we are westerners  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  , and the way that we communicate with people , we &apos;re only two : two ,  UNK  .
can you get it out ? do you get money ? &quot;
this is a problem with congress .
i &apos;m tired of this .
and it means &quot; it &apos;s a politician . &quot;
there &apos;s less than the technology of existing technology .
abuse can only live in silence .
ready to go to college .
and this project has made a huge difference for us .
you don &apos;t have to change your mind .
thank you .
kenya grew up with  UNK  , and six of them are  UNK  .
and with other people , i had my head on a  UNK   UNK   UNK  with a  UNK   UNK   UNK  , and i had a blade of  UNK  on the neck on the wall , and i  UNK  them on the  UNK  .
and when they were attacked by the tsunami , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , , all of , everything else , all the stuff that they had .
thank you very much . shukran . thank you .
i &apos;ve visited a village in india , which is a slave trade .
it &apos;s just about the local  UNK  center .
and that &apos;s why i was involved in the  UNK  , which was the first time , was probably the only outsider in afghanistan , because in afghanistan , it was very dangerous .
my family is not poor . and for me , i &apos;ve never experienced a lot of hunger .
we cleaned up a lot of  UNK  ,  UNK  fish ,  UNK  fish , and the fish were  UNK  .
so , starting with the first step in this direction , we started  UNK   UNK  .
sometimes , there are older women who have never seen them , and they &apos;ll find their pictures of their own , and then they take a picture of them , and then upload it to them , and then upload them into the other end of the world , and then upload them into the other end of
so over the last few years , i tried to do a little bit of different  UNK  ,  UNK  , and with these simple tools , to create a lot more and in the public spaces .
this one of the people that i &apos;ve ever heard , i &apos;m going to leave my head and i &apos;m going to kill me .
they have overlapping relationships .
what &apos;s called  UNK  ?
and when she came out of this picture , she was telling us some stories about the photos behind us .
because the last step in the domestic violence is killing her .
but very quickly .
we &apos;re trying to communicate with the local community .
i don &apos;t think anymore .
thank you .
thank you .
he asked us to come up with a  UNK  to the jungle .
we were scared , but we still want to go to school .
in some cases , this has been inspired by some of the things that they &apos;ve created , and to give some more things , for example , to their communities , not only to be able to build a  UNK  model .
and the only thing that you can see is that here , and if we have to sell it for you , we &apos;re not going to win .
and i was working at a  UNK  ngo , and we had every project in africa .
and this is called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
but let &apos;s try .
it &apos;s pretty cool , and they share a story about how they interact with them and how they interact with their own mother and their grandmother , and they can see that they can make a really cool thing , just for this moment .
they allow us to track , our memories and our past , our first time to be ignored , but sometimes we first want to look back .
i thought i had spent my life in my life , and i was trying to hide my fears and fears and answering their questions .
in the culture of the culture , it &apos;s especially important in the culture , in places like places where there are no places where there &apos;s nothing to go , and there &apos;s no wood , and there &apos;s a  UNK  system for the people .
that &apos;s 20 .
the first time i knew about the word &quot;  UNK  , &quot; and i had to say , &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
you can see the lights , and you can see behind it , these are  UNK  .
we are also  UNK  and  UNK  , but we &apos;re very careful .
and all of a sudden , i don &apos;t seem to be able to call a nation state of my own country .
so in fact , i &apos;m not .
in korea , it was much more difficult than i was imagining .
but that &apos;s the self .
so this is my muse , and i tell people , to grow your food .
i want to introduce you to my two brothers .
and they said that this is really ridiculous , you can &apos;t call him a meeting .
the kids get out of their homes , and they &apos;re doing their jobs , they don &apos;t work .
through the secrets of his talk , he shares a tremendous amount of  UNK  . he told me that he was four years old in his body , and he began to take his  UNK  from his  UNK  , although he had to do it in his  UNK  , even though he had to be in his .
yes , they are almost all the photos , but it &apos;s just a small part of the work .
i couldn &apos;t deny my career as well as i did .
it looks like this .
and i hope that we give them a  UNK  .
we need each of you to understand the secrets of violence .
i &apos;m here , some of the great goals .
noise is going to disappear .
what can we see ?
prices are very low , and we also know how to do it .
so what happened ? 40 years later , in 1900 , there was one in the united states ,  UNK   UNK  .
i wanted us to become the  UNK  of the environmental revolution .
the other passion is to build on the basis of self , and that &apos;s the most important thing .
for example , this isn &apos;t the  UNK  , and i can &apos;t let you see his face , and he &apos;s my father .
in the taliban , in the taliban , i remember that sometimes i feel guilty about my life , and i can &apos;t be afraid of the future .
i saw my gardens as a tool for education , and it became a tool for my community .
he had a  UNK  memory .
so i was so lucky , and i got so much to help and help me , and so i wanted to help the help of all the dreams of the dreams of the dreams of the dreams of the dreams of the dream , the opportunity to dream .
you know , you take a camera out of a totally stranger , and it &apos;s not uncommon .
every year , hundreds of thousands of years migrating up to china and returned to the north korea , they were tortured and tortured .
and they took me down the stairs , and the staircase went to a glass ceiling .
they &apos;re very far away .
all of these projects come from my own questions , how much of my neighbors ?
sounds crazy ?
i was scared .
and two weeks later , i got 150 million volunteers , and they &apos;re willing to join us .
in fact , most of them are random .
even though we are all  UNK  , but our  UNK  has become very different , because of  UNK  .
what do you want to come from ?
and for every 20 minutes , i had to go back to my car , and put my device on the air , and it would be able to hold it in a car , and i couldn &apos;t sit in the car , and it was much better .
and there &apos;s a lot of advice to suggest that it &apos;s possible .
the first way i think of is to use fire , because i know the lions are scared of fire .
i slam the garden and land as the canvas and the trees , and the trees and the trees are on my canvas .
UNK  : my next invention is , i want to make a  UNK  . what is the electricity ?
and as my  UNK   UNK  said , it was like a tattoo .
there are  UNK  birds on earth .
i don &apos;t know what it means .
now , in los angeles , i have a legacy .
this is a picture of me and a magazine .
there was a day in the air fuel .
how do you -- -- &quot; i said , &quot; i did a very difficult thing .
what i &apos;m talking about is domestic violence , and i &apos;m going to answer the question , and everybody &apos;s going to say , &quot; why is she  UNK  ? &quot;
the answer is very simple .
no one would refuse , and fortunately , no one was holding our cameras .
all of these images from the tsunami of the tsunami , and in the  UNK  , the bacteria , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of , , , of
UNK  , ok , that &apos;s amazing .
no .
and we have these two billion dollars in the last 50 years .
it could be saved for a minute .
and he was starting to do it , he was working on the ground .
&quot; in the hunger of hunger , the  UNK  of the
yes .
this is where i live in kenya , kenya , in southern india .
today , i did .
we had  UNK  in the middle of the  UNK  , the studio , in the middle of the , , the the the
so scientists and engineers , please talk to us .
at the end of his uncle , he was going to continue to take his uncle , and he was forced to work on his work .
and just a few years later , we had the first time that we called &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
so a few years ago , i had a thought , why didn &apos;t we have at least at least one of the ideas that they &apos;re not thinking about them ?
and so i went to some of the  UNK  of the house in the house of a house , and i , and i , and i , and i , , , i , , , , i , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and again , we &apos;re sitting on the bus , and we drove a car in china .
when i was in the age of the age of high school , i couldn &apos;t have six percent , and if it wasn &apos;t my family , i would like most people .
but we &apos;re going to get enormous amounts of data from different sources of data , and the point is that it &apos;s different from the different environment , because we &apos;re able to eliminate the causes of these things .
i want to introduce you to you .
and that &apos;s why the degree of  UNK  , the  UNK  and the the , the future of
a dollar  UNK  can give you 75 dollars .
so , the day of the day , i went on facebook page , and i asked a few friends , and in the next morning , there were lots and lots of messages , and they said , &quot; well , they &apos;re willing to help .
i don &apos;t know , the second is the victims .
this is a picture that i took a few days ago , a few days ago .
in fact , every three american women in the united states has been a victim victim or a potential target , and the report report that there are 15 million children per year .
nobody wants to build a company . nobody .
thank you very much .
in order to change communities , you have to change the soil .
there are many women who are doing their own children , and they &apos;re in the  UNK
you have to tell them what they &apos;re doing .
if someone was telling me that this guy ,  UNK  and loved ones , i would like to make sure that i was going to work with , and i would like to do a little bit more about what i would do , and i would like to do a job interview with someone who was going to
thank you .
because my family didn &apos;t understand chinese , i was scared of them .
and during that period , we don &apos;t have a device for the equipment or the  UNK  , and most of the
and these are  UNK  , and they have 90 degrees , and they &apos;re trucked out of their shells , they &apos;re trucked out of their  UNK  , and they &apos;re trucked out of the  UNK  .
he didn &apos;t talk about it , but it was the best way to talk to him .
UNK  , but this is just half of the fact that we &apos;re never going to say , and i &apos;ll never say , &quot; i &apos;m not safe . &quot;
so what we did was , we took these photons , and then hundreds of thousands , thousands of times , and every time it was a fantastic video game , and then we had a picture of a bunch of  UNK  data , and this is what we saw earlier .
one of my favorite words is called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
so -- so the government said , &quot; well , then it &apos;s done . &quot;
this is the reason why i became a global jihad , which is a global group of women in education .
so with this technology , we can actually see the camera on the edge of light , and we can see the camera on the face of the eye , and we can see the camera on the camera .
and i said , &quot; well , of course , i &apos;m not sure people are going to steal it .
and the road congestion pricing is so extreme .
the solution to the solution is to use the asphalt .
let &apos;s keep him safe .
as you can imagine , this town is definitely  UNK  .
so there &apos;s a  UNK  plan .
and when i &apos;m here today to talk to you , these guys are still fighting in the mines , there &apos;s no money , no taxation .
some people just want to call him the king .
and as a result , they agreed to be called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; but they also need to be sure that they don &apos;t have to be sure that they &apos;re not going to disagree with this statement , whether it &apos;s not the case for the state of the country , whether it &apos;s the  UNK  of
there are people who are not aware of knowledge , but we can provide support .
i was 22 years old , i graduated from harvard college .
let &apos;s say , let &apos;s take our beds , our clothes and our family became the safety of peace and peace .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve heard about when we hear a lot .
this is  UNK  . when his father died , his uncle sent him to his own work .
so what i did , i was in my house in my house .
and what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s more than people who are killed .
so we took a lot of samples in this way , and we had lots of tests in the lab .
and then you have to pay attention to them .
and sometimes i see the body of water .
and i thought that we were  UNK  in africa , but when i knew what americans were in the united states , the british situation , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , was , and i was , proud of .
but how did some of the  UNK  ?
he looked at the  UNK  , and he started asking questions .
i can feel  UNK  people from  UNK  , but i can &apos;t see anything else in the dark , and i can &apos;t see anything else .
what happened ?
and i got these because i was my identity , not my identity . some people were paying for them .
and i know that some of you may be familiar with this idea of some kind of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
we got there , and i went to see a little bit about it .
we were in the gowanus canal and  UNK  .
and so this idea came up with a couple of weeks later , and i went to los angeles , and i went to los angeles , and i wanted to make a difference .
the next question that people ask is , &quot; do they have photos ? &quot;
we had a week on the bus for a week , a few times a lot of times .
i see the  UNK  center like starbucks .
and i see that there &apos;s a whole bunch of young men in the boat , a couple of little kids , right ?
and a tree can get a thousand , a thousand seeds .
and then i thought about a lot about the death of death and then , and then i was going to make my life that i had , and i had my life and i had the meaning of my life .
i spent the last few days of japan , and i found myself in a  UNK  center .
so what do you have now ?
in west africa , some of the people who don &apos;t have compassion in the  UNK  of  UNK  and  UNK  .
three months before , 2011 , i was photography ,  UNK  , new york city .
and even a few hundred years ago , he had a sense of how he and his love and what we did .
so i broke my silence .
so i had to find a solution .
we &apos;re going to take a step in your life and your friends .
at the end of this , i &apos;ve been  UNK  by a  UNK  woman .
it &apos;s about the words of words and words .
we have  UNK  machines in the lab .
some people don &apos;t even think that they are being deserted by people who are working on a daily basis for their daily lives , because they &apos;re born with these days .
one day , a week ? actually , a year .
so , in our papers , we published it in nature , and it was translated into nature , and then they created this animation .
&quot; before i die . &quot;
the winter was very uncomfortable , but it was very cold .
but there are still a few of them .
strangely , the places i &apos;ve been .
and i ended up in the mines where i was going to go home , and it was never going to come home .
and so we started  UNK  .
i &apos;m going to end up with the crazy word &quot; love &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
but it needs to maintain it .
now , remember , this whole thing is going to happen at the end of the year -- and this is the time of time -- but now i &apos;m going to take this video to the speed of light .
that was the first time that i heard about my country in my country .
thank you very much .
what should be a  UNK  leader ?
this is a  UNK  .
it &apos;s not too heavy , but it &apos;s not really bad for a little girl in the picture , but we &apos;ve got to fix it .
but for the first time , i was left with the wisdom of his intellect and humor , and his  UNK  looks like a farm boy .
and over the last time , we went on the road , and she suddenly stops , and she pointed out , and she pointed out a red line , and she said she was very fond of  UNK  , and she was very fond of how she was born .
well , in the last few centuries in the past few centuries , it &apos;s not only just the health of our health care , but the  UNK  and the  UNK  , the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
this is my first time in afghanistan .
at the end of the road , he was going to take the driver out of the driver .
mastery and the possibility of progress and changes in the way we want to be the same .
it &apos;s similar to the  UNK  .
everything was ready .
and it &apos;s going to be  UNK  .
and at this point , i heard a man who said , &quot; how ? &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of the lessons that i &apos;ve been working on for a decade , because it &apos;s not like an  UNK  , a poet  UNK  .
and when you grow up , you think , when you grow up , it &apos;s like you &apos;re going to win the lottery .
in a small band , the woman and women and children have only seven days to get their customers to eat more food and wine .
in a  UNK  community , we have 200 people .
and when i look at people around me , it makes me feel very painful . this is what i &apos;m doing , and people ask me , &quot;  UNK  , do you don &apos;t get people to steal your food ? &quot;
and then it &apos;s been  UNK  by the disney -- it &apos;s like a dog dog , and it &apos;s been  UNK  ,  UNK  .
after that , i went to the  UNK  and the , and after my , , , , , , , after , , , after , , ,
barack obama said , &quot; the president of the obama , &quot; now , it &apos;s just a few weeks ago .
my hand , i got a little bit later , and when i got a  UNK  , , , , , , , ,
but of course , because of all sorts of tissue and blood , and it &apos;s really hard , so we &apos;re calling the scientists to really focused on the  UNK  , to bring this technology into a new model for the next generation of health care .
and it &apos;s a reminder that reminds us , and reminding us some of us , some of us , some of them , some of them , some of them .
it &apos;s not  UNK  .
my father -- that &apos;s what he was -- he was the first person in his family .
even a few months .
so basically , if you want to meet me , if you want to meet , if you want to look at the comfortable chair , you don &apos;t have to come up with me .
i &apos;ll never forget that morning .
there &apos;s no comparison .
ah , he was ready .
you can ask your clients .
it &apos;s very beautiful .
thank you .
it &apos;s estimated that there are over 4,000 million children in the  UNK  , which is the largest hydroelectric  UNK  in the world .
but a lot of people don &apos;t think so .
over the course of japan , six months later , &quot; volunteers , &quot; volunteers , &quot; volunteers , &quot; volunteers , &quot; volunteers are helping to help japan , and we &apos;ve got a lot of  UNK  photos of the  UNK  photos .
so i had a idea .
and there was a whole bunch of  UNK   UNK  , and she asked me if i could get her in my house .
we &apos;ve got this project in 300 parts of the world .
it wasn &apos;t going to come back home , and i said , &quot; hey , although i &apos;m going to come to you and i &apos;m going to go into the next step , and i &apos;m going to go out and get you to you , and i &apos;m going to leave you with your hometown ,
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be very , very , very , very  UNK  .
so why is it more important ? first of all , it &apos;s an important part of the ecology of ecological ecology .
&quot; before , before i die , i wanted to do it . &quot;
a couple of years ago , i saw an interesting article on a magazine article .
and the trick here is using simple , simple sentences , and the audience is , even though it doesn &apos;t really understand what &apos;s going to be able to communicate , and then we &apos;ll be able to express the images of our senses , and gives us a deeper understanding of what we &apos;re talking about .
in fact , these are a lot of times , but as long as long as you can imagine , you have any kind of digital video to analyze it , and it &apos;s very advanced , and it &apos;s very advanced , and now we &apos;re able to look at what &apos;s going to be able to look
the first question is , how do you become a model ?
there was a life of war and how to build this kind of  UNK  and  UNK  environment , which was designed by the way to the  UNK  , and to the the the , and , , , , , , , , , ,
and every time you see it , just like this , first of all , you &apos;re going to have a certain kind of  UNK  , which is  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
it &apos;s very uncomfortable , very good news , and the good news is that i don &apos;t want to wear them .
he told me two things .
&quot; ah , this is not me . &quot; am i going to help you ? &quot;
we can do clinical trials in a clinical trial , and it &apos;s very low cost , and we can be able to scale up the scale of the number of time .
we have to give them a commitment commitment , and respecting their privacy , and we need to be good at them , so they &apos;re going to go to the door .
why didn &apos;t i run ? i had a lot of opportunities .
it &apos;s not all that everyone can do .
am i korean korean ?
my new school is now joined with me and help me gain more money .
so far , i &apos;ve been working on this  UNK  in our family community , which is very useful for us .
the government is free to give us a  UNK  freeway , which is the distance between 400 meters , and we &apos;re doing it .
and what you see here is the  UNK  of this material .
we &apos;re lying on the floor , and our bodies are too sick , ready to die . &quot;
and for her , despite the  UNK  disaster , of course , is the best gift to the son of his son , and he was able to come up with the memory of his life , and it was no longer what he was left behind , and it was the destruction of his life .
we need to define the definition of  UNK  .
this is one of the top of the united states of the united states of the united states in the united states of america , and when i returned to afghanistan , my grandfather , my mother daughter , who was married to my father &apos;s daughter .
and behind me behind my father was the  UNK  of the  UNK  in nairobi .
at the end of the day , he went down to the road and drove him down , and he threw it in the face of his face .
this is one of them in one of the six lions .
my family has trusted me .
first , you have to give them a promise .
they killed our livestock .
and yet , what do we do ?
&quot; why are you  UNK  ? &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t ask . &quot;
and i found a switch on a switch , and i could fly on the lights .
and at the same time , i &apos;m thinking , if there is no way to get healthy food , what if you get out of your home , what happens when you get out of your own food system , and what is your experience ?
it &apos;s far more than it .
so i gradually become a little bit of  UNK  .
i saw these boys in the morning when i was in the morning at the end of the morning , and they were at the end of the morning .
i wanted them to know that we were going to change their lives .
i &apos;d like to build a whole neighborhood in the neighborhood where people could share the food .
you can guess what &apos;s going on .
and this is where we started looking for survivors to help us .
and i hope that these images are going to be able to come up with you in your mind , and i hope that the power of the power of the power of the power of being mortal , is to be  UNK  , because if there isn &apos;t a lot of  UNK  , it &apos;s not going to
food is a problem , food is a solution .
well , here &apos;s a picture of her .
no , it &apos;s a  UNK  .
and even though that happens , i still believe that we live in our lives , because we have so much love , because it &apos;s too late .
there is no one who has never been able to work and produce jobs and sales .
i always say , &quot; i &apos;m found , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
our work is not office .
but we didn &apos;t ask them because they said , &quot; we &apos;re here . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of water in water .
and that was , in fact , when they came together , they came up with the new york city for the new york city , and they came out of the following year : 100 years later .
i live in los angeles .
all the businesses in the world is only one thing in the world , there &apos;s only one thing : there &apos;s no business .
and for the first time , i was at the end of my wedding .
and finally , this will lead to more and more damage .
and when i was photographing this , i took a lot of a candle in my translator , and i was able to put it in my photographs , and i wanted to be able to and to my them , and my , and , and i , , and i
it &apos;s like a rock in the water tank .
the second step of domestic violence is the beginning of violence .
i had my first apartment in my first house , and i had a big secret .
and then you add it .
but if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t let us go out and look at them , they don &apos;t have a good conversation .
nobody knows what we are .
there &apos;s beautiful beauty in the photo that has to be done with the  UNK  , or a little bit of  UNK  ,  UNK  the  UNK  , and to
i guess they &apos;re expecting the answer to say , &quot; if you &apos;ve got a little bit more , you have your hair , and you will be happy . &quot;
so this is the first fact that i &apos;m going to tell you about domestic violence , whether it &apos;s not about your ethnicity , religion , income and education .
now , if we &apos;re going to give you a benefit , i hope that we all have the power of the power that we have , and what we can understand .
what &apos;s your next step ?
at that time , we don &apos;t know that this journey will change our lives .
you know , it &apos;s going to be  UNK  when it comes to fish .
so , the conclusion is that we &apos;ve created a material that we use , using a  UNK  increase in which we can use , and it &apos;s a lot more expensive .
that &apos;s my burden .
this material is kind of a little bit , and if we want to go to cities , cities like the netherlands , we would like to get noise .
and on the picture , he &apos;s going to  UNK  the  UNK  , and the the good news , and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the and the , and the and the and the and the and the and the and the .
government ?
we can reduce the issue of the patient .
i mean , some of them would call him a  UNK  for the washington , d.c. , and he called george washington , and he called  UNK   UNK  , washington , and he called  UNK   UNK  .
so what i &apos;d like to say is , is that the transition is the transition .
i &apos;m a very  UNK  victim , because i have domestic violence and development .
and i was in two years and a half years ago , and i was going to be
you &apos;re not going to believe that you &apos;re going to hear this story .
and it turns out , because we &apos;re looking at the speed of light at the speed of light , and we have some strange phenomena , and einstein will be happy to see these pictures .
when photographers came to me , i was very upset with my hair .
so what do i do with my team at mit ?
driving on a road in ghana , with a  UNK  with a  UNK   UNK  , an  UNK   UNK  , and suddenly we drove up our cars .
you know , some people might not be giving us , or not .
people were sent to the photos , and i was lucky enough to get their trust , and let me start with them .
he doesn &apos;t remember my chocolate  UNK  , but remember that i &apos;m going to go to the  UNK  , and , , , , , , , , , ,  UNK  , the the on the the on , my
and there &apos;s one on the bed of the bed , and it &apos;s down in the pocket .
whether it &apos;s a big company , it &apos;s going to make the three things to do three things : it &apos;s going to be  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
i &apos;d like to share with you a few people on the wall .
and i really appreciate him , and he said , &quot; why would you help me ? &quot;
he was not just because my college was in college , and it was because i was the first one in the women , i was the first person to drive him on the streets of kabul .
&quot; before i die . &quot;
and i also wanted to take a simple  UNK  and  UNK   UNK  in the wall street , and to see how the art of the , to the the , of , to the , to the , to the .
this is the first time on ted stage , so i think it &apos;s very lucky to be here .
i want to ask you one thing .
and it says , &quot; when you read this letter , it &apos;s all five of the five people in the house , because we &apos;ve had two weeks .
so , like lions like lions , and this is what they &apos;re doing .
they were so elegant . charles darwin said that he changed his view of his mind , and he saw the  UNK  in the air .
and i really believe that when we think of them as a result , it &apos;s really hard to tolerate it .
but after the book , &quot; after this book , a lot of men and women have told me their stories about what they &apos;re doing , and what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re going to live their lives -- the joy of life , their wives -- and the mother and the mother and the mother ,
thank you very much .
in this picture , i &apos;m actually not in the real world .
in fact , my student  UNK  , and i have to mention that , because he made some amazing things that he did , and now he proved to be able to put it on a mobile phone , so we now have the 99 percent accuracy .
he had a deep  UNK  .
now we &apos;re putting them into the living room , but in the future , we can put this technology into the car , so that we can look at the lights , because we can look at the window , because we can see on the window , because we can see on the window , and we
and in the new york , young black men in the new york city , there were only 17 million people , and they said , &quot; would i be ? &quot;
he was willing to understand my family , my childhood , my wish and dreams .
we &apos;re going to inspire entrepreneurship .
and if you listen , they say , &quot; no , no , i don &apos;t think , when i &apos;m going to say , &quot; and my boss . &quot;
you can &apos;t have any  UNK  , otherwise it will be a mess .
in 2009 , i lost one of my people .
&quot; the taliban came out . &quot;
first of all , i &apos;m going to give you a sense of understanding of the models of models .
when i was 11 years old , i remember one day in the morning , and there was a voice in the house .
on the 13th of december , i went to japan .
now ,  UNK  .
kenya is going to have the largest wind turbines in africa :  UNK   UNK  , which is going to be installed in the bay area .
and then we help them collect information and information , because that &apos;s the world ,  UNK  .
and the truth is , because their minds don &apos;t seem to be trusted by people , they are often misunderstood .
this is an  UNK  building , which has been an extraordinary place , and the hopes of hope and the dreams of my mind , and to me , to  UNK  me , to  UNK  me .
it makes us believe that we are not alone .
because of the number of songbirds , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the the  UNK  the  UNK  ,  UNK  the , the the , , in the , , the in the , ,
some  UNK  came out , and so on the table , so you start to see these lines .
in china , i was a very young girl , a little girl .
you may agree with that .
so what we &apos;re going to do -- is shut up .
everything i did , whether it was my life in my life -- i was working on the whole life of young men in africa .
and we had a  UNK  in  UNK  , and a half an hour , and it took me up to the  UNK  , and the the
our scientists and engineers are going to be the biggest problems that we face , from the environment to health care , etc . , if we don &apos;t understand , they don &apos;t understand what they &apos;re doing , and i believe we don &apos;t understand what they &apos;re doing , and i believe that we have a
but a lot of people tried to die .
so this is los angeles :  UNK  hotel ,  UNK  .
what can you do for the patients to go to the clinic , and if the patients can do this test ?
images are powerful , but it &apos;s also  UNK  .
you &apos;ve tried it again , right , but you — — — i &apos;ve tried it , but i stopped it , because i got it .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
and so my team and my team , &quot; los angeles , &quot; and we started to grow our food forests ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
she explained to me when she was five years old , and she stood on the screen .
i tried to recruit the members of the members of the  UNK  to become the heroes .
he was the same kind of  UNK  , like the  UNK   UNK  , the  UNK  , .
but if you look at this tree , you &apos;ll notice that , in the  UNK  , it &apos;s on the  UNK  , and it doesn &apos;t .
our first project gave me a book about the first book called &quot;  UNK   UNK  , &quot; and in this project , we decided that we decided to teach the food industry .
and i wanted to know what i was going to talk about , and how i was going to
so my great dream is : when i grew up , became an airplane engineer and a pilot .
and in our family , we &apos;ve got to go to the age of seven or eight years old , and that &apos;s what happened to me .
it doesn &apos;t require a lot of money to hire people .
we have the number three million people on the planet , seven million people on earth .
and the other question that you want to ask is , why not ?
now we &apos;re going to ask , why not ?
and it &apos;s going to be a  UNK   UNK  family , family , and .
in kenya , all over the world , there will be huge losses in the world , if we lose these amazing species .
we &apos;ve helped to build 40 companies .
and in order to make my family freedom , i would be able to do it in the end of it , and it was time to go through the end of it , and it was not going to
shortly after that , when i walked into a railway station , i saw a very sad thing to me .
but you can do it in a way that you might be  UNK  .
and our  UNK  is pretty good .
it &apos;ll be a  UNK  . richard serra , you &apos;re different .
you know what ? you can choose any career .
it &apos;s in almost every corner in the world , even though it &apos;s illegal .
and because of this ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , , , , , , , , ,
and it &apos;s a kind of enterprise for business , and it &apos;s a company that &apos;s going to you with your home , your kitchen table , or in your kitchen table , to help your resources to create your own passion for your family .
and in the himalayas , i met with the  UNK  of the  UNK  , and the the and the the and the the
i could only be able to rely on the  UNK  organization , which is able to be able to be able to
these images are not about issues , but it &apos;s about people who are real , and you &apos;re all about the right to the right , the dignity and respect .
this is a  UNK  portrait .
look , really , really .
the  UNK  used to be gold .
and then , when you describe science , you use the jargon .
sometimes , school is going to be a  UNK  week .
now , if you take the same thing with a normal bullet , you take a video of video , and you know , you know , you know how long you have to wait for this ?
in july , it was only in japan , and we created a branch of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
when he was , he had to go to the top of the tsunami .
let &apos;s make a weapon of your choice .
in schools , we &apos;ve spent a lot of time to learn about history , but we &apos;ve never had a lot of the world in the outside world , except for the rest of the united states , korea and japan .
&quot; normal &quot; is not the difference between the difference between people , and it &apos;s not the wrong thing .
and we need to be able to measure the end of the end , and want to know that the only way to think about is , the only way that we have to do is that we have to answer the
there are more than 200,000 people in the world today .
every week , we were able to scan the  UNK  devices , and they came up with them , and they came up with them .
he had a huge amount of treatment .
and in this period of time , it &apos;s hard to live in life , and it is more important than ever before .
i couldn &apos;t give them any direct help .
thank you .
many of them are going to end up and down the road .
so , for example , i &apos;ve got to say that the average elite in my neighborhood is less than 10 times more than five times faster than we &apos;re going to be .
it was a small village in japan , which is about five million people , and that was the place where it was .
i was in the first year at the end of the night , and in the days , i got my first clients , i helped the first guy , and i was , and he  UNK  , and the the , and the the , and the the , and to the the , and to the ,
and i realized that that was a moment in my life .
&quot; i didn &apos;t have time , &quot; we &apos;ve got 32 .
and although i have a lot of the outside world , i thought i would spend my entire life in north korea , until all of the things that changed .
and when you take a picture of it , the owner of it , it &apos;s a huge difference .
and we gave her back to the day that she was going to be she was 14 years old .
i &apos;d like to take the  UNK  for the health of the health .
and because of the  UNK  and the leaves , my camera , couldn &apos;t .
so they were  UNK  , killing them .
but 1995 , my mom took a letter from home , and she came back from her sisters .
when i was growing up in a war in the war , i went to a friend at the end of the night , and i looked at the children of the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the , the , the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
now , if i &apos;m going to laser a laser pointer , and a couple of seconds later on the second one -- it &apos;s a couple of  UNK  -- i &apos;m going to make some photons , and these photons are  UNK  , and these photons are , like a bullet .
these people are completely paralyzed , and when we &apos;re confronted with this , it &apos;s important to know that there are all the things that we have in our own backyard .
we collaborated with  UNK  and  UNK  , and we wanted to track the data from all over the world around the world .
that &apos;s it .
but the hardest part is to go to the gender of the gender and the professions , because my own self is the biggest  UNK  .
he was  UNK  , and very few of them , because most of the news was going to him .
at the same time , it &apos;s also on the table , and because at the top of the top , you can see that at the bottom , you &apos;ll see that at the bottom , you get to the bottom .
it started a little bit later , and then more and more and more -- and i &apos;m not going to show it .
we were sitting in the subway in new york city , and he started with me .
and i &apos;m worried that these changes in the u.s.
and over time , more and more and more of them are repaired , and we need to be able to do all of these things , and i , to the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
i was walking around 50 , and i went to 50  UNK  trips , and i was 19 years old , and i was 19 , and i was living in florida and  UNK  .
and the reason why this is the  UNK  of the  UNK  and the
a lot of people think this is what it &apos;s about .
and in fact , those of these muscles are very likely to be treated like  UNK  and  UNK  .
what &apos;s going to happen ?
when tomato comes up ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , from the  UNK  , the  UNK  , all over the  UNK  .
five years ago , i had a kind of an epiphany , and it was a kind of  UNK  .
and yet , there &apos;s a secret sauce .
and he went to the , and the voice , he warned him , if he would send her daughters to school , and it would happen .
we just moved to the new york city -- and i thought , well , i should think it &apos;s safe -- he bought a gun gun .
now we &apos;ve been working on  UNK   UNK  , and we , at the end of the  UNK  , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
he was screaming .
he said that , when he was a kid , he had to have these guns .
it &apos;s pretty much time . thank you .
they know that these images will be seen .
i don &apos;t know .
i talked to other people all over the world , and we couldn &apos;t wait at home , and so i decided to join them , and i got to join them for three weeks .
so we put the books on food , and we thought we would just go shopping .
and there was a question that they had to deal with the idea of george washington , and their leaders .
dr.  UNK  has taken this picture of the  UNK  with the  UNK  , and the , , , , , , , , , a , a .
and this woman is very lucky to give us a picture of these photos .
so i went back to tears , and i couldn &apos;t cry , and i was crying out of the  UNK   UNK  , and i  UNK  him , and he said to me , &quot;  UNK  , don &apos;t cry . &quot;
and that &apos;s why , after 10 years later , i decided to go to korea , and then i started a new life .
so when i &apos;m going to prepare for this talk , it &apos;s hard to find that it &apos;s hard to find a way to be honest with it , because if i stand here and say , &quot; look , i &apos;m going to have a strong advantage in my life , &quot; and it &apos;s going to
let &apos;s know a lot of insight into our neighbors .
but what if the patients could do that ?
and the thing about sustainability is that you have to maintain it .
i don &apos;t want to go to washington .
there is no artistic director , no  UNK  , no  UNK  .
the  UNK  of the , the of the , the , the the , , the , of , the the , of , , of , , , , of , , of , , of , , , the the the , , , , the the the ,
thank you .
i &apos;m confident that you &apos;re going to see more and more and more and more on the stage in the world , including ted .
there &apos;s no  UNK  .
and i &apos;d like to give you an example , and i got a letter , and i got a letter from  UNK  , which was six months later , and i was coming home from japan .
and after five days , the 10 fingers on the neck of my neck , i was dressed in my mother , and i married him .
these guys are  UNK  in ghana .
i &apos;m not going to go to you with the money that you have .
and what we &apos;re using is we can clean up with steel steel ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , and we can put them together , and we put them together .
but two words are different .
and that &apos;s why the senate is against this .
you have to get access to the clinic , and it &apos;s really pretty large , and it means that there &apos;s no one ever done this before .
i lived in new york , and there was 14 million people in the last year , and they were  UNK  , and they were young black men .
now , of course , we need to have extraordinary talents and brilliant skills , and it &apos;s going to be  UNK  .
there &apos;s no  UNK  window .
it &apos;s an asphalt , and it &apos;s a very nice material , and it &apos;s very good at it , but it &apos;s not always , especially in the weather .
and we did surveys , for example , in a world , a company in the world -- research training company ,  UNK  companies ,  UNK  , the company , the  UNK  , the , , , ,
a year ago , i was one of the big fish in the united states , a young boy , who i was looking at the plane flying , and i said , &quot; i &apos;ll be there . &quot;
and then over the course of two hours of  UNK   UNK  , we have a huge amount of  UNK  on each of them , and each one of them is a  UNK  in every single one in the  UNK  .
i was in a  UNK  mine in ghana .
and as you can see , this river is very , very , very , very , very , very , to the to
you can &apos;t eat , you can &apos;t eat , you don &apos;t have a lot of luxury , because they don &apos;t need a toilet .
i &apos;m just blown away .
and if i want to come up with this , i &apos;m going to  UNK  the garden , so we can do something .
the translator tells me their story .
and what happens is that happens in the camera , sometimes it &apos;s been shot , and through the process of space and space , we can do that .
UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  , but we have found out that some of the workers in the periphery of the areas of the
and the real reason i &apos;m going to do is , i &apos;ve got some of the genes that i have , and what you might be
at the university of pennsylvania , i was asked to teach this teacher to teach students to teach students .
and i think that &apos;s how nature works , it &apos;s a  UNK  , one , but of course , our eyes are the combination of the .
you can read this book , called &quot; deadly aid , &quot; author is dan  UNK  , a  UNK  .
i saw the wheelchair as a  UNK  car .
at night , the night at night .
this is one of the health of the health of the health care , which we think of ourselves as a voice of the sound , because when we  UNK  , we &apos;ve got to coordinate these  UNK  , these are  UNK  genes .
and i thought that there was only one person in the world that i was going to stay in my men , but in fact , it was very common .
and we &apos;re going to walk around the world every day , and we don &apos;t know where we &apos;re going to .
it &apos;s not necessary to go to the clinic .
at the time , i was driving with my friends , and she was a bad driver , and we drove me down , and i said , &quot; sir , i &apos;m going to go ahead .
please don &apos;t say , &quot; normal . &quot;
UNK   UNK  . they don &apos;t create this title . i mean , this is a long time ago , but it &apos;s a meeting .
so it started with my journey of modern  UNK  .
he &apos;s not religious , and he said , &quot; he never .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve got to talk to them , and discover their interest .
so this is one of the things i &apos;m going to do , and this is what i wanted to do .
we can do it .
these two words come from  UNK  ,  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
and by the way , if you go to the clinic , it costs 300 dollars .
don &apos;t say i &apos;m a normal person .
instead , as einstein said , let &apos;s say it &apos;s simple , not simplistic .
moreover , i realized that there was huge differences between korean and north korea .
and i want to change this . i want to change the way you think about it , because they need our compassion . they really need .
and i believe that the key to the door is that there is a lot of communication and communication .
but those waves should move us .
in order to change the world , we have a lot to communicate with our scientists and engineers .
and i saw their own , and my father , as my father , as my father , even though they saw their faces .
but i do what i have to do , because my self has to do it .
it &apos;s not going to be within your control . it &apos;s a great business model .
in addition to this  UNK  , he has  UNK  tuberculosis , and he has to have to work every day .
so what it means is that people can use your phone calls on your phone , and then you do this test , and you can do this , and then you get the phone call back , and then they &apos;ll be able to look at them , and then they &apos;ll be able to look at what
it just means that there &apos;s a different species .
i used to say that in the english language , no one of the reasons why it went on to the  UNK  , and for the rest of my life , and the two of the
so i &apos;m going to show you some examples of what we &apos;re doing .
and i wanted to talk to a  UNK  , and he was dressed in  UNK  with the  UNK  singer , and the  UNK  , as the as the as the and the and the .
when i was a kid , i think my country was the best one in the world , and it was a little girl named  UNK  .
i &apos;d like to share a few useful ways , and tell you how to make sure that you have a lot of science and sexy .
this is a terrible thing that looks like this .
and the recent study has shown that in the areas that don &apos;t have to live in the area of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the , to the , and the
and if these pictures don &apos;t get clean , we can &apos;t fix it , fix them , but they have to be dry .
but the second answer is , and i want to ask questions about the question , &quot; why ? &quot;
we &apos;re often a picture .
so , what &apos;s going to do next ?
in fact , i &apos;m a typical domestic violence , and a domestic violence .
i don &apos;t know what it means , but i can see that dad is very happy .
in india and nepal , i was sent to the  UNK  .
some of you may not be familiar with the word &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is a complex brain disorder , and it &apos;s a  UNK  brain disorder .
what can you do ? can you make it ?
it &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between north korea and south korea , and so , ironically , i flew in china to the border .
the public spaces can be better for us to understand what &apos;s really important for us , and for the whole community , for us , we have a lot more and more and more of our lives , not only for us to be able to create a better place for us .
for us , it becomes more sacred .
thank you .
abuse may be happening in your daughter , in your sisters , your best friend .
there &apos;s a problem with the community .
the work of my work is my graffiti , and my own art .
and if they were serving the freedom for themselves , they burn all their houses .
it &apos;s like the graffiti artist , and they  UNK  the walls , and i  UNK  , the lawn .
however , there are millions of people who are infected with this disease , and they &apos;ve got to be able to suffer from  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , so that we need to be able to .
on the contrary , i &apos;m a very poor woman , and this is a man who has this horrible man , and i &apos;m the only person in the world who can help people who live in .
because it has a lot of it , and it &apos;s noise . it &apos;s quiet .
who &apos;s going to invent this technology ?
and i met him , and he was 14 years old , and i saw this guy in 14 years , and at the end of the accident , it was a cease-fire in the accident , and he said , &quot;
we are the soil .
and occasionally , there will be a handful of these  UNK  meetings , and there &apos;s a  UNK  government , but it &apos;s really something that &apos;s not .
i &apos;m working with computer simulations , and i wanted to do a thorough task , and i was outraged in my hands , and i couldn &apos;t breath out of my neck , and i couldn &apos;t breathe , i couldn &apos;t breathe , and he yanked my head on the back of my head .
so i was living in fear of fear , and i feared my identity was going to be found out , and i was going to come back to the north korea .
now , what i &apos;m talking about is the story of a romantic love story , is a  UNK  of a  UNK  , a year , a year , and , , , , .
the second thing you can learn is that when the u.s. government says it &apos;s just a temporary thing -- it will continue to be  UNK  .
&quot; i &apos;m helping people in north korea . &quot;
i conducted the experiment in the state of  UNK  .
in los angeles , people died of the disease .
and i thought , &quot; cool , that &apos;s it . &quot;
the school was in a house , and we had 100 people in a small living room .
and i thought it was crazy , and i didn &apos;t know that i had taken into a  UNK  of the  UNK  of the and of the and the and of the
and it &apos;s hard to find a lot more  UNK  than that .
that &apos;s five million dollars today .
and if we could make this material , we have a solution .
UNK   UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
they don &apos;t want to call him the king of his king , or what he would call him .
in fact , for the sake of the daughter , they &apos;re usually the first ones and the most compelling , but in society like afghanistan , we have to support men .
and i think that people are so easy to take away from the  UNK  , and forget what &apos;s really important .
i don &apos;t believe that i am a woman and a woman who has never been there before .
there &apos;s a woman who has a  UNK  guide .
so today , for me , it &apos;s going to be honest .
this is me .
one of the kids had been caught by the tsunami .
the worst news is that i &apos;m going to take it out of the head because i &apos;m going to laugh at that point , because you &apos;re laughing , i don &apos;t do it .
now i &apos;m going to show you a new piece of technology , which is called  UNK  , which is a technology that allows us to capture light .
i mean , of course , how did they do that ?
and i think of them as a second .
UNK  knows what love is .
and it &apos;s fast as fast as 30 seconds .
so the first question is , how can we high-tech ?
but as a conversation , the experience of the conversation , as i did , as a result of the rabbit hole , you see that there was a window into a whole new world .
thank you .
the neurological test is  UNK  , and they &apos;re using existing infrastructure .
the light bulb comes from a  UNK  .
it was like , &quot; what am i going to be ? &quot;
but this time , i &apos;m going to go to the secret of the
so in los angeles , he wrote a story about a story about the story and a palestinian group , and a group of members of the local group , and they brought it up to the  UNK  , and , and , and
and when he stepped out of our childhood  UNK  , we had forgotten , and i forgot about the lyrics , and he reminds me that we were obsessed with the spirit of what we know about .
when i read a book , i read a book called  UNK  , which is called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; author , &quot; and the author is the most important thing to do , if you don &apos;t want people to help others .
the other end result is that the result of some of the  UNK  , the , and the , to the and the , to the the and the the and the the and the the and the and the the children , the the and the the and the the and the to
and that &apos;s what i felt with my students , and i was amazed by their thoughts , and i hope that other people can experience the feeling of it .
and they kept finding pictures and photographs and  UNK  and  UNK  .
after that , one police said to me , &quot; the report was wrong .
you can think about some examples , stories , and analogies . it &apos;s all of you to talk about what we &apos;re excited about .
and he saw a place in a house that was used to a place called  UNK   UNK  .
thank you .
this is my legacy , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing .
i was married to my husband husband , and i had three children in 20 years .
they get their  UNK  .
and i remember standing in the darkness of the darkness , and i was terrified of my horror , and that i was thinking of what was going on .
so by using lasers , we can take a picture of the original picture , which is what you see on the screen , but we &apos;re going to take a lot of photos , lots and lots of light , and then analyze the light that we can see that hidden hidden ?
it was created by a group of photographers ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , and their  UNK  , and they , and they , and they , and they , and they
and the next generation of entrepreneurs are  UNK  .
but it &apos;s hard to keep in mind .
at the time , i didn &apos;t know ,  UNK  and  UNK  was the first step of domestic violence .
they &apos;re just  UNK  birds .
peter  UNK  , one of the greatest achievements of  UNK  , a few years ago , a few years ago .
so they decided to kill these lions .
the next question that people ask me is , &quot; can i grow up ? &quot;
it has 26  UNK  .
and you can see , again , on the table , the background is the  UNK  and the wall .
because i was a little kid , and i could do this day , day in my own room , and i even my my mother  UNK   UNK  , and i was  UNK  , and i , and , i , , i ,
but unfortunately , i &apos;ve got to tell you , in a study of dr.  UNK  , who has been conducted in all of these  UNK  models , and there &apos;s only 27 percent of the people who are in the  UNK  .
my dreams are big , but they &apos;re expecting me .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter came out of school , and they were killed by  UNK  .
and my behavior is probably going to make them worse than now .
you know , in the united states , seven million americans , i live in food in los angeles , los angeles ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
and the guy said , &quot; yes , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t get here . &quot;
and finally , after traveling through a long trip , i was reunited with my family , but it was only half of the war .
these things happen to us , and we just don &apos;t know .
now , we rebuild the  UNK   UNK  , but we don &apos;t know how to make their own money and their energy .
and because someone tells us that it &apos;s going to affect his life in the future .
it &apos;s everywhere .
when they come out of the mines .
can you imagine a 400 million people , with a lot of people and  UNK  ?
from 1971 to 1977 , i was very young , but actually i was older -- i was growing up , and i was in zambia , kenya , kenya , somalia , in somalia , somalia .
when i was seven years old , i saw my first encounter , but i think i was living in north korea .
&quot; before i die , i want to be in the audience . &quot;
this is the first picture that i took a picture of my first apartment , and i didn &apos;t have a  UNK  .
but i didn &apos;t give up , and i was .
this is the only way that we have two people .
what do you do ?
and even though this is just a good definition of a newspaper editor , and he said , &quot;  UNK   UNK  is a guy that he &apos;s going to fight for any kind of thing , and he doesn &apos;t care whether it &apos;s not going to fight for any kind of  UNK  , no matter of any kind
it was thrown out of his hand , and the father of the father and the red and the red .
we &apos;ve got about 50 people participating in our team , and they &apos;re all volunteers .
it &apos;s not just boring , not just boring , but we depend on the language of our brains .
even though they were caught , but the great international  UNK  , they were released .
and the tsunami in the tsunami , he was responsible for the tsunami of the tsunami of the tsunami .
and i often think about why they have  UNK  , and we don &apos;t .
i &apos;m not against the wind , but we should ask for the government to think about the government , because the wind blows up to the birds .
so this is all of this project , which is a little bit of a little fragments of human nature , to the people .
and even if we had  UNK  , my family was still illegal dumping .
and it &apos;s kind of weird , and it feels like a walk into the  UNK  or the  UNK  .
a real school .
how are we going to be able to get more from the side of the ladder to the , and at the end of the ?
and it &apos;s because it &apos;s too hard to get rid of it , because i &apos;m here with the  UNK  .
we have volunteers team to help create a  UNK  and  UNK  , and to the , and we the , to the the , to create the , of , to , , to , , to , , , , , , , , , , .
we &apos;re helping schools and  UNK  houses , cleaning up , and to rebuild it .
in spite of life , it &apos;s not a , but i decided .
and that &apos;s why the white people in africa are called  UNK  , which is the boss .
this number is twice as much as in the transatlantic slave trade .
thank you .
so i &apos;m standing here today , and i &apos;m standing here in afghanistan today , and the gods of my life , and my father &apos;s  UNK  , who is an atheist political and an artist who has been living in afghanistan , working in afghanistan .
150 feet to 10 feet wide .
and this one is my favorite , and it &apos;s much better than the  UNK  .
the air pump , it &apos;s very hard to breathe .
but if we don &apos;t change the soil , we will never do that .
but coke didn &apos;t fund this experiment .
and the first day they saw it , and then they went back , and then the next day , they would come back and said , &quot; this thing was never going to be there .
&quot; when i was looking for those pictures , i was thinking about each of those images and the stories of the photos .
and so we went out to the  UNK  , but i had to spend almost all of the  UNK  in the border with the police department .
the reality and the history of the
the english language was so important , so i had to start learning the third language -- english .
but no one can help them , because people don &apos;t have their own family .
and every one of them gets bored , and in fact , because this debate has been three .
i feel very proud .
well , dance is one of the human activity .
they don &apos;t even have the  UNK  , and their ideas is that you can have an election .
so in the sound , we can go to the position of the  UNK  , as we can , and we can impact on it .
i can &apos;t give them money .
and i moved to new york , and i started my first job in &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is the editors and editors .
but today , it &apos;s only about 18 percent of the family in the family .
&quot; how would anyone be willing to live with her men ? &quot;
for the first time , i went to search for the secret to the secret , and i lost my head , and so on the back of my head , it was so hard to put my head on the front door .
in  UNK  , men , women , children , in fact , the entire family in the  UNK  of the , the the , and the , and the , and the , and the
you can become the president of the united states or the next generation of the internet , or the  UNK  of the the , the  UNK  , , because you .
let &apos;s look at this . it &apos;s a little bit too hot .
so , why do i do this ?
these guys helped me .
peter  UNK  was a philosophy professor , and peter  UNK  once said , &quot; plan is a  UNK  and social entrepreneurship . &quot;
and what that means is that i &apos;m going to put other people in my own .
we also have the opportunity to start looking for this disease in the early days .
now ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  has been banned in india , and they have a positive attitude .
for him , kids don &apos;t have education .
and recently , if you look at the news in kenya -- it &apos;s been  UNK  -- it &apos;s like  UNK  and  UNK  .
and there &apos;s a lot of trees in the trees , and those who are going to die , and those who are going to die , they &apos;re  UNK  , to the
because , at least , we have a  UNK  .
and one day , my worst nightmare , i was gripped by the police and the police to the police officer .
now , you can learn from the story of three things .
so these are these things that i think is going to help us to open up the keys , and it &apos;s a good approach to science and engineering .
he didn &apos;t just get it .
thank you .
whether or not there are differences between us , and every one of us has a gift to say , &quot; normal , &quot; which is completely  UNK  .
at the end of my daughter , his wife said , &quot; hey , why don &apos;t you have to go back to new york , and you go on this little tour ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to design a series of new hospitals .
so we did this experiment , and we added a lot of  UNK  , and we use them to heat them and  UNK  them .
most importantly , passion .
and i was scared , and my heart was blown away from fear .
so they gave him one of them , one of the most beautiful , most famous ones .
in fact , the results of this experiment was that , if we were in the last four years we were using our  UNK  machines -- we were able to put this machine on the road -- we would have to go on the road -- we would have to go on the road , and , of course
if you &apos;re not a  UNK  , you &apos;re not a rogue .
&quot; why is she leaving ? &quot;
now , you may be surprised to be able to do that , if you put it into your canvas .
jargon is the idea that we understand your ideas .
it &apos;s a  UNK  material that can be used in the middle of the netherlands , which is a little bit of water , the water , and the , the the ,
it &apos;s what we call a  UNK  .
we have to learn how to empower them .
and then in a few months later , i realized he was different .
and of course it &apos;s going to be a problem , but we have a solution .
and in the beginning , he made me think that i was an architect .
and so when the chinese officer went down to my house , i was able to tell him that it was a  UNK  , and i
and when we got closer to the boat , he was shaking on his  UNK  , and he was on his  UNK  .
these are the ones who are not going to go to the elections in the public to the public , the , &quot; i , i , i , i , i , i , i , , &quot;
because i had to worry about how i looked like every day .
over 85 percent of men are men , and domestic violence is only in the intimate , long term , in other words , in the family , in the family , in the family , in the family , is that we don &apos;t want to be seen or not , and it &apos;s one of the reasons
think about death in your life that makes you feel better than your life .
and what i want you to understand is that these are not my pictures .
&quot; you can go to a real school school . &quot; he said .
you have the ability to stop the domestic violence .
and you can see the bottom of the bottom line is a  UNK   UNK  .
there was a terrible famine famine in the mid- &apos; 90s .
thank you .
now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to get up , you just have a little bit of light , but we &apos;ve got to get closer than the shortest time , so you don &apos;t have any light .
and as soon as it turns out , it can be expanded .
so this is what we did . what you see here is the experiment that we did , and of course , it &apos;s not going to be bad , and we didn &apos;t know that .
i met a  UNK  in  UNK  , and it was january , it was cold .
do you wonder whether it &apos;s effective .
we need to help each other .
and there was a lot of people i met a lot of people , and i met a very , very  UNK  organization of organization , the organization of this organization .
where do i come from ?
so , for example , for example , in the end of the year , there was a news that allowed the news reports to report on the  UNK  .
so i &apos;d like to give you an idea of a way that we can try and do it , because you know , in a sense , at least , in some sense , we &apos;re all like a friend of mine .
now , of course , it &apos;s a little slow , a  UNK  .
i &apos;m on this stage , because i &apos;m a beautiful lady , and we are , and we , we , we , we
i put it in , and i put it out and see what happens .
these girls are lucky .
and sure enough , in addition to surgery , or two days ago , two days ago , we were able to do what we would do in the work of our work , which we could basically change the appearance of our appearance , even though we had our lives .
it &apos;s one of the most endangered species of them .
even though he &apos;s holding his head with my head , and i put them on my hands , to kill our dogs , on the freeway , on the freeway , on the freeway , and i was ready to get out of my bed , and i &apos;d never thought of myself as a wife .
it &apos;s got a lot of time resolution , and you can see the world through the speed of light .
and when you look at the end of the night , it looks like this .
and they &apos;re going to cut off the flesh of the larvae .
so at the end of the senate , the senate won &apos;t , because nobody would feel guilty when they were told by the federal government .
but the memory is selectively selective .
and the same as it is , it needs to be special training .
and she said that when she saw the first time she saw it , she came out , and that was nine years ago .
and i &apos;m going to take five of these  UNK  , and instead of  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , to sell a  UNK  kilograms of  UNK  , to sell to a  UNK  , a , to sell it to a  UNK  , a , to , , , , , , , ,
because , i took the same picture of every year , and our view of it , the daughter , she came up with her new eyes , and she looked at her eyes and looked at how she looked at it .
some of the north koreans came to china in the foreign ministry of china , but a lot of people were being watched by the police , and sent to the north korea .
this is  UNK  , as part of china and the border .
so we &apos;re going to take these light up , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the light will flow into the direction , and it will end up , and it &apos;s going to go back and forth , and it &apos;s going to come back and forth , and it &apos;s going
your money may be  UNK  , and you may be fought for war .
there was a woman who was lying on the ground , and she had a child with a child , and the child was going to
i couldn &apos;t have a lot of the things that i left in north korea , but i could only say that it was the hardest part of the famine in the famine , and i was sent to china and  UNK  .
now , i &apos;m an application for the math of mathematics , which is a special problem , and we &apos;re working with management management .
these people are scared of them , and they want to give up , but this is a woman who has a lot of them in the middle of the  UNK  , and the , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
over the world , every 20 minutes , there &apos;s a new generation of autism , and this is one of the reasons why the global disease burden of the global growth , but we don &apos;t know what it is .
i even experienced my identity .
so scientists and engineers , and when you solve this equation , it &apos;s just going to say , i &apos;m going to talk about it .
don &apos;t get it wrong .
the whole process is very time-consuming .
and as you can see , it &apos;s powered by solar panels , and it &apos;s going to provide the energy to the battery , and i call this  UNK  .
&quot; we don &apos;t have freedom . &quot;
after a year later , we went back to new york city , so we decided to take a picture of the same .
i was a member of the  UNK  , so that the police had my  UNK  abilities , and asked me a lot of questions .
but then i realized that there was nothing to do that , and it also helped us see lions in our own .
you &apos;re going to be influenced by the children .
there is no  UNK  name .
it &apos;s not easy .
i knew it was a little bit of private , but i was young .
the most amazing thing to do with the  UNK   UNK  , which is to me believe that i &apos;m a
we don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
it &apos;s not saying that mothers are not important for our success .
you need a kind of machine like this , a  UNK  -- it &apos;s used to cook .
now , most of the time spent most of the time , 500 companies , including  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
on march 11 , 2011 , as the rest of the world , i saw a tragedy in japan .
i lived in new orleans , and i fell in love with the city .
and in fact , it &apos;s because of a brave man , the great name of  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
we talk to our clients and restaurants .
i &apos;d like to talk to a very unusual animal .
he was afraid of the water .
who &apos;s going to take him up , and if he &apos;s just a little  UNK  , like , the  UNK  , the the the
and i heard a lot of people listening to the voice , but it was more  UNK  than the  UNK  .
they &apos;re all  UNK  . it &apos;s not , but it &apos;s not a
it &apos;s kind of like the food itself .
but in order to make sense of what it means to do with politics and politics , i want to take you back to the united states , and it just happens when it comes back .
and over the course of three weeks , the senate has no  UNK  .
i &apos;ve got a video about javascript .
they can eliminate all the bacteria on their bodies , and they can absorb the virus spread out of the spread of the virus and the spread of the disease and the deaths from disease and disease .
these pictures are very easy to go .
and for afghanistan , i realized that -- this is the western state of the west -- and this is the father of our father -- and he was able to recognize the daughter of his daughter , and his daughter .
and when you look at these  UNK  , they &apos;re moving away from us .
for me , afghanistan has been hope for the possibility of hope and possibilities , and every day at the end of the day .
and i &apos;m never going to have , and i &apos;m always going to be a , and my , my , my .
she was retired two years ago , and she took my family into a school , and girls in the community .
at this moment , you &apos;re thinking , wow , this is amazing , or , &quot; oh , she &apos;s  UNK  , &quot; but in the whole process , i actually talk about you .
maybe it &apos;s happening .
that was the morning , i was wearing  UNK  .
do you don &apos;t want to continue ? &quot;
let me tell you why .
i remember one day , a mother and daughter , at the end of the night , when i was looking at them , and when i came out of them , they were very upset .
so i found a old  UNK   UNK  , an  UNK  . this is a small device that &apos;s found out of a motorcycle , which is able to take the light on the motorcycles .
i want people to take it off , but at the same time , i hope that people will be able to live healthy . &quot;
so whether it &apos;s going to look at the end of the next generation , whether it &apos;s going to be for the next generation , we &apos;ll be able to add up all our data and the details that we &apos;ve created , and we hope , and we hope that this is the  UNK  community , and
this is a satellite picture taken from the north korea and  UNK  .
and here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you in your powerpoint presentation , don &apos;t use it .
UNK  hotel ,  UNK  , the land .
and of course , you can say , &quot;  UNK  and  UNK  , &quot; why don &apos;t we have a space for space ? &quot;
but i &apos;d like to think about them what i teach them about personality and communication , love and love , and i realized that i don &apos;t want to use it .
and one of the time when i was in a town in los angeles downtown l.a.
my grandfather was an extraordinary man .
and one of the most precious things we have , is a time , and there is a connection to connect with other people .
we use our hands on our hands .
and what we did was , with our clients , we had to build a society that we had to build a systematic society .
who are you talking about the most inspiring talk ?
afghanistan has a different difference .
even though i was lucky enough to go north korea , i had a lot of people who didn &apos;t .
and i assure you , now i &apos;m listening to people who are speaking to people who are being abused or abuse , and you &apos;re a  UNK  .
my story began to have a story that i was in a new york city in new york city , and my wife gave me my daughter &apos;s birthday , and we were at the end of a year ago .
so the senate won .
and then he pointed out on the ground , and he said , &quot; here &apos;s the path . &quot;
what &apos;s going on in the  UNK  ?
so these pictures are far more than just a moment , or a special journey .
there &apos;s enough space to grow  UNK  million dollars .
all right . thank you .
i was six years old , and the taliban went to afghanistan in afghanistan , and they were not illegal .
tell me what you &apos;re hearing today .
i was lucky enough to grow up in a very good education .
so that &apos;s what i did .
i was shocked .
so , we don &apos;t know that the distance from the door to the door , and knowing that the distance is hidden away , but we don &apos;t know where it is .
if kids grow up , the kids will eat .
they think it &apos;s a kind of  UNK  , and it &apos;s
wrong ! they are slaves .
he was born in afghanistan , and he lived with him , and he kept his daughter with his daughter , and my mother , went to school , went to school .
at the age of 21 , i think we are  UNK  , and we &apos;re doing good for africa .
and i &apos;d like to tell you that i was lucky enough to change the image of 10 seconds .
i don &apos;t know about you , but for me personally , except for 15 , i &apos;m not going to be in the family .
and this is a little bit more  UNK  than the brown of the brown , and it tells us a special structure of  UNK  ,  UNK  , even the  UNK  design of the  UNK  , .
and one night , i was walking around the house , and i was walking around the night , and that night , it was not .
that was one of my moments in my life .
and that &apos;s what i want .
what are we doing ? we &apos;re looking at these  UNK  . we &apos;re installing them on them .
and we &apos;ve got all of the raw data into it .
so , you know , darwin &apos;s coming back to the u.k. , and i &apos;m going to tell you why .
thank you .
so you &apos;ve got this scholarship . richard  UNK  : yes .
this boy is eight years old .
at the same time , it will produce a lot of noise .
because i couldn &apos;t decide anything , you could be the director of the american &amp; amp ; ms  UNK  , or  UNK   UNK  .
and if there &apos;s a lady that i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t have to say i don &apos;t have to tell me now , but i &apos;m going to get there .
but the words of the word for politics is really important , and all politicians have to understand how they &apos;re trying to control them .
so there &apos;s no doubt that his children should be educated , including his daughter , even though the taliban have a risk .
when we do it , we know whether we will .
we can monitor the data on the data .
rl : i know that electricity is already there , but i just want to do my own .
and i live in this house , and i think , how to make it be a better place in this community , and it also changed my life .
hi , i &apos;m  UNK  , and i &apos;ve been a a .
now , the whole thing .
in addition to  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  , which is the  UNK  of his  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , of a .
now , my approach has been used in kenya for all of the other animals that are used to use other animals , like the hyena , the same as they &apos;re used to  UNK  the  UNK  of .
do they know what we do ?
and again , i &apos;m tired of getting tired of 45 minutes to buy a  UNK  .
i &apos;m just changing the  UNK  in six seconds .
and then he explained to me that it was very dangerous to me , and it was very dangerous to me , and for those workers .
since i had a camera camera , i &apos;ve been watching photography , but i &apos;d like to share with you today , and i &apos;d like to share with you some of the most beautiful pictures that i did .
i remember that they were filled with  UNK  , and there were a lot of people in the  UNK  , and there were 72 hours .
in fact , 10 years .
first of all , why are they going to leave us with this bad thing ?
it &apos;s a surprise .
and because we have a camera camera , so we have a camera camera , and this camera has a unique capability .
i was really frightened . these students have the brains of their brains , and their  UNK  , their  UNK  , and .
we were  UNK  and  UNK  and dance , and you &apos;ll know that .
he just had a lot of stress , and i had a lot of my family and my family .
some other heroes can be invisible , but imagine a future in the future : he can see the  UNK  behind .
within a year , i conducted 27 projects , and the government came to ask me , &quot; what do you do ?
because it doesn &apos;t happen .
it &apos;s not  UNK  . we really do it .
i did not have a chance to wear a two-inch heel , but it was something that i didn &apos;t get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t want to talk about .
so what we &apos;re going to do is we put it up to the steel , put it into the asphalt , and the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the .
unfortunately , more than a million of them are killed in famine , and a lot of survivors are on the grass ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
we did a lot of samples , and the government had seen our results , and they said , &quot; that &apos;s interesting , we should be doing it . &quot;
the second fact that i &apos;m going to say is that a lot of people think that violence is happening in women , and that should be women .
and what we &apos;re going to care about is how we &apos;re going to be in a sustainable way to improve our food , health care , education , transportation and communication .
this is the reason why .
it &apos;s an unfortunate fact , and that &apos;s where the water has to be  UNK  , so hard to survive .
i had the english class at harvard university , and there was a  UNK  mba in the business school .
when we were in the end of the industrial revolution -- we used to use fossil fuels , fossil fuels -- but we suddenly realized that this development is unsustainable .
help survivors of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
my friend was with me .
and i began to realize that the lions are scared of light .
so what i wanted to do is i wanted to make this more attractive .
this guy has to go to the treaty and the  UNK  .
let &apos;s take your ideas , simple ,  UNK  .
now , if you put this bullet , and these photons are going to hit the bottle ?
thank you .
and that &apos;s because they want to make their own sounds like that , you know , there are 5,000 people , and so on .
because my family didn &apos;t understand chinese , so i had to help them in china to go to china .
many of them are being  UNK  by a  UNK  , who is a good job , a good job , good jobs , to work , to the , to the .
now , this is a little bit of  UNK  to say , who are you going to be able to , who , who ?
this is an accident , and he won &apos;t hurt me .
why don &apos;t we care about it ?
UNK   UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
when i did a  UNK  activity , i found a chance that we could train our children in their communities , and in a sustainable life .
they had to go back , so i started planning to help them .
this is the  UNK  of the  UNK  and the  UNK  and the , , , , , , , , , , and the , , egypt and the , egypt and egyptian egypt and egypt and egypt .
and the south of the national park is not in all the  UNK  , and that means that , like this , the like the , the the the
this is why i want to keep it .
thank you very much .
she &apos;s not  UNK  . &quot;
and especially if you &apos;re wearing a bicycle , with the car , it &apos;s not good .
not only because it sounds good .
and it was amazing , and it was very inspiring to me , and i was listening to people , and i was always thinking about it . i was able to do what it was done .
i don &apos;t think free , because it &apos;s not sustainable .
i &apos;ll tell you a secret .
so this is our reconstruction .
it &apos;s getting more and more and more and more , and everything else around me around the world , except for the rest of the river .
if they grow their tomato , they will eat .
otherwise , the girl &apos;s face doesn &apos;t look like her face , and it &apos;s just a picture .
charles darwin , charles darwin , in the course of the atlantic ocean , and found out in turkey , and he said , &quot; these  UNK  , the birds , the birds , the birds , the birds , the birds of the birds . &quot;
when we were in the back , we would give a answer like this .
how are we going to express our ideas about our  UNK  and our communities that reflect our needs and dreams ?
i read a journal of the  UNK  journal , and i had this record , &quot; this is the subject . &quot;
i use my black  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , the .
it was incredible . we were talking to the people , and we said , &quot; look ,  UNK  . &quot;
are we going to track ?
think about how long it &apos;s going to take a long time .
and i realized that if i didn &apos;t rebel , this man would kill me .
and this photograph was actually taken by her husband , and she was discovered in the local  UNK  , and it was very far away from it , and they recognized him .
this is what it looks like .
the number of  UNK  in los angeles .
they take these pictures , and they gather them , and they &apos;re going to
this is the first try .
we all know about the danger of life , teachers , students and parents .
there are a lot of a lot of reasons why it &apos;s due to the  UNK  because of what &apos;s happening in kenya , and the people who are using their  UNK  to the animals , to the , the , the , the
so we can help our education to help education education , english , training , etc .
i was 22 years old , and in the united states , 16 percent of women suffer from the likelihood of domestic violence against women in the united states , and in the united states , there were more women in women in the united states every year or a woman who were killed by women who were killed
he was very afraid of being rude , and he was paralyzed because he grew up in the same way that he used to be treated with him .
just before i started my new life , i received a startling call .
this was taken after 9 / 11 years ago , and i was trying to explain how 9 / 11 happened was going to try to get this child .
they were all the government .
and what i &apos;m excited about is , i see my students in my school can be able to get opportunities .
it was the most beautiful buildings in the world , but at the same time , she was also the city of the most expensive buildings .
the people around us can help us make a better place .
and i &apos;ve been working with the  UNK  and the , and the , and , and , , and , , and , , and , , , , , , , , , ,
that &apos;s her .
we have a lot of historical significance .
when i was 27 years old , i made a decision based on the demand for people , and i created a job system called  UNK  , and we didn &apos;t do it .
so i thought , &quot; wow ! this is my responsibility , i have to keep it , so i want to do anything . &quot;
the next question is , &quot; can you get free ? &quot;
in a couple of weeks , all volunteers and all the residents , they found something like this .
thank you .
UNK   UNK  himself in his own world , in his own terms of what he did , he was looking for fun , and he looked at it with his hands , and he looked at it , and he looked at the washing machine .
and the parents meant that i would like to think of people as a child as a child . &quot;
but at the same time , i &apos;m happy and standing there , and i am young , and i &apos;m young , and i &apos;ve not been working for 10 , 20 or 30 years now , and i &apos;m going to have , and more and more than that , i &apos;m not going to have to
and we started this  UNK  , and that &apos;s where i actually started to understand that reality , although i know all the time in the world , i don &apos;t know that it &apos;s going to be .
her name was  UNK  , to me , as she was like my mother , and she was dead .
so what i &apos;m talking about is to get people to get them out of the streets , to get them out of their own food ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
