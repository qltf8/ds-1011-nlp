i &apos;ve been trying to fit into the kiln , i &apos;m going to take it out .
kofi annan saved a little village .
but i struggled to maintain this view of your life .
mayor is more than the  UNK  .
so many years ago , i have this idea : why don &apos;t we , only one , instead of a community , and to tell people what they should do , why don &apos;t we hear , how do they cheat one ?
when you &apos;re going to talk about it ? the ball is delayed , kill dead ! and they &apos;ll kill his lecture .
we needed to act like teaching  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
if you don &apos;t want to do that , how do you have to do ?
there &apos;s a picture , a lot of women in the home , from the young people , surrounded by the same because i had a similar image , three , my mother , my mom , my father , and her father , on the wall .
&quot; i can actually go to school , &quot; he said .
UNK  , of course , could be a problem , but we have solutions .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
he did this at the beginning by my wife .
unfortunately ,  UNK  and conservatives became the symbol of the
on the other side , however , at the moment , our basic needs is , are we all right ? &quot;
it costs about four dollars , and to test this test at the northern hemisphere .
that doesn &apos;t exist .
when you go home , let &apos;s tell you the representatives of the companies and the  UNK  can hold the specific information , even though they don &apos;t necessarily have to do that .
since then we started to cross the  UNK  .
there &apos;s no technology to do that .
so we &apos;re taught that &quot; our tolerance footprint . &quot;
i &apos;ve always been a picture .
and what we do is to be the member of each other , and figure out what you want to do .
so for the online and the data of the city , i also do the same thing .
when he was about me home , the phone cell phone , a  UNK  , if he kept on his daughter , and they &apos;ll be again .
then you need a machine , as you can see here is the machine to cook -- a  UNK  .
behind me was my father , my father , and then after the father , the national park .
this is the significance of this project ,  UNK  the small pieces of mankind , bringing the connections to someone .
so the green land continues on about 20 feet .
and some people have said , it &apos;s like  UNK  2.0 .
kyoto is the most advanced machine and the challenge you can do , particularly in the hills .
five days later , the  UNK  were on the grass on the grass that i had fallen up , and i wear my smile , and my granddad , and married him with him .
i was responding to dr. philosophy at the time , trying to get away from the helmet , and that tells you what to do .
she &apos;s .
and he rides the gun on my head , here i went down to the floor , my fortune to the  UNK  , when i was driving in the cinders of my wheelchair when i was wearing it for dinner , and i had never been thinking of myself as a broken  UNK  .
thank you .
one of the most exciting things that were made , from the beginning , was to create a hallucination that i was involved .
i didn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
we  UNK  , who are fun .
i have a heritage in  UNK  .
for me , it &apos;s the sad and the saddest , because we , the victims know something that you usually don &apos;t know : it &apos;s a terrible danger to stand a  UNK  .
and i realized that that ended up .
they helped kill bacteria . they  UNK  the anthrax that they can spread and spread a huge amount of nutrients to the livestock and disease for others .
i see that the american sees the fragility , goats in the changes .
have you ever wondered why we call them &quot;  UNK  ?
you can see that my step .
the next step in this violence is to violence against violence and see how to respond .
you see , some people might not do that . maybe they don &apos;t call me .
and i was always saying , &quot; oh , i was discovered , but it didn &apos;t mean anything .
it &apos;s not  UNK  . &quot;
when we moved to new england -- you know , where the  UNK  depends on the ground -- he buys  UNK  guns .
at first , i was , we &apos;ve expanded the  UNK  of the  UNK  town , far from the north of north .
who are you in the room ?
you may even know where i was walking by the train i was like , and i was a lot of  UNK  that i could call the link between those two places .
why ? because they look at the curve on the street and say , if the population population growth in this scale , to move a population of the new york city , they will need to be six million tons , and from cuba to a million million vegetables .
i &apos;ve just completely changed completely what you think about me for six seconds .
i have a bachelor in english at harvard , harvard and the business of business school .
sometimes they make demons .
but i didn &apos;t give up . i kept on thinking .
and that &apos;s a great revolution .
this is not where the mother is not important in our success .
and , the thing that i like most is , but more  UNK  are much more .
thank you .
that explains why in the  UNK   UNK  and  UNK  in the wall street and his future would have a big deal with him .
i don &apos;t know how you guys , but at all of these photographs , i didn &apos;t have a lot of doing in my family .
and this is my father was the first person in his family &apos;s family .
i don &apos;t remember whether you have a plate of candy -- you know , but i remember the year of my song of my song , all the talks that we were four years old , my father-in-law  UNK  on the first day , and the birthday of the  UNK  .
when i sing the songs from our childhood , trying to remember those words that come to me , i &apos;d like to remind you that : we know about how the brain is , and what we don &apos;t know .
the other questions that people ask , why is it not ?
over the next five years later , i was like a boy boy to walk with me just a secret , because i was thrown out of my house .
UNK  doesn &apos;t prevent the spread of disease .
in china , life &apos;s a little girl from the family , as i was very hard .
this character has never been born .
when it &apos;s a picture like this one of the night , it will make a huge transformation in the lives of the people .
this should be the first principle of aid .
but many of them were dead .
&quot; before i die , i &apos;d like in a tree . &quot;
UNK  is the police officers in in germany .
when they &apos;re too aggressive , nine , and there are red , just one kilometer , they &apos;re about 200 yards from the surface and to clean books .
i felt like every time someone in  UNK  , new orleans .
he was sitting next to me in the new york city , and he was apologizing to me .
we started talking about slavery , and indeed , i began to learn about slave because i knew that it exists in the world , but not that .
and also with a cell phone that you can actually make a song , and it &apos;s  UNK  up and  UNK  .
it &apos;s like coleridge . it &apos;s not his name , and i can &apos;t ignore his eyes , but my motto is my father &apos;s father .
it &apos;s very easy to  UNK  some of these .
thank you .
UNK  young men are on the front of the road , the high risk of freedom , dignity , social justice .
i &apos;m big , but my family dreams for me even bigger .
so what i do in the first year at the  UNK  is just  UNK  on the road , and in the three days i had the first guests in a basement , called  UNK  , and i was able to give him a whole restaurant in  UNK  , and then , working with the job , and then the person came to work , and then he was helping me to help him ?
they were lawyers , journalists and the  UNK  , all all said , &quot; we don &apos;t want to be . &quot;
there was a great woman woman who gave us .
nobody had a company alone . nobody else .
because i want to show people how the data is real .
and if you don &apos;t trust me , let &apos;s take home to provide the information that they have dreamed of them .
remember , i was fortunate enough to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in kenya , the international international school , and i was really excited about this .
one of them is three .
this is where people  UNK  them , and that night i &apos;m honored to say , because they believe me that allows me to give them a long time .
and you don &apos;t forget to hear the  UNK  phrase , it &apos;s a disorder of the brain that are influencing access to society , learning and sometimes  UNK  .
and the people said , &quot; well , that &apos;s why we have nothing in here . &quot;
when i met him , he did 14 years in the open , and the wound in the dark desk that you see this is from an accident in an open , which is a shepherd  UNK  .
and then , we didn &apos;t know how it &apos;s going to change our lives .
and recently , in a trip , we &apos;re walking walking , my daughter came out of the road , and it &apos;s just going to be the red line of the  UNK  stores of it , and it was like to remember when they were in childhood .
in the age of our  UNK  , this is more important than ever to figure out how to sustain it , and remember that life is short and  UNK  .
and let &apos;s turn it into weapons .
in fact , most of them were taken by early adopters .
i don &apos;t know what to expect something from this experiment , but in the next day , the walls were completely rusted , and it continued to evolve .
it was a small bottle of  UNK   UNK  , to a population of about 20,000 people , one of the first places that are affected by the tsunami .
because  UNK  doesn &apos;t keep the environment .
the north korea has to take his identity and fight to survive as a tragedy .
photography is my passion for me since i &apos;m big enough to make a camera , but i want to share with you the 15 pictures that i wish , and i don &apos;t have any of them .
it was on a long way that we called the street .
right now , you might think , &quot; oh , this is great , &quot; oh , &quot; oh , she &apos;s going to do , but all this time , i &apos;m actually talking about you .
and we helped them to look for insight , because nobody in the world could be alone .
take your cell phone , or your  UNK  !
that &apos;s the real  UNK  .
take the &apos; course &apos; &quot; except &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pete &quot;  UNK  , &quot; share that , &quot; share that explain to the audience , and then with the &quot; passion for what you &apos;re doing , then the result is going to be a great interaction interactive .
and if you drive up there , you &apos;re going to destroy these  UNK  , as we see here .
this is the family portrait .
in 28 years , i collected the local foundations of the country 70 countries across the continent , six years , and south 2009 i had the privilege to be the only way to the only exhibition at the  UNK  conference .
my sister has come to me .
the transistor is that material that we &apos;re using to build most of the dutch in the dutch , and there &apos;s a hole in the kiln . so all of the rainwater will come across , and you &apos;ll have to be able to drive . so there &apos;s no water .
the aspiration of the male self is the most important thing .
this is a legacy that was designed for me and that was the legacy i made money on it .
and i &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with the honest .
and the day i showed her to her her son was 14 .
i tried , it &apos;s not , and you know , you know , you know , but you &apos;ve got it before , but before you &apos;ve been using it .
one was he , like me , king of the  UNK  school , and that he worked at a very high level of wall street .
watch . yes , it swings .
for me , afghanistan is a single country of hope , the ability to not limit , and every single day at the  UNK  school .
these folks don &apos;t have , they  UNK  , they want to give them , who were in the middle of the  UNK  and to the people who were in the pavilion that they were able to  UNK  their own  UNK  contracts , to figure out their own work , but their own work , and they were in their freedom .
think about death of your life .
thank you .
as the baby is alive , to keep their hands , they all fled , everything is left behind .
but when i went back to afghanistan , when i see my students in my school and my parents were supporting them , encouraged them to encourage them , encourage them to be a promising future and change that will be long-lasting .
if the kids indoors , they &apos;re going to eat the hump .
i was glad because i had to think about my image every day .
they have 42 squared  UNK  .
this  UNK  landscape is like 36,000 in the world who &apos;s  UNK   UNK  .
the opportunity for the great transformation , progress and the change change is when we try to become something like somebody else .
because it &apos;s very widespread , all the noise will disappear , so that &apos;s a lot of silence .
for him , our children are not to be  UNK  .
i want them to take them , but at the same time , i want them to get their health . &quot;
it &apos;s , &quot; how am i going to get over and over again ? &quot;
of course , there &apos;s still a lot of uncomfortable , and that &apos;s what the hell of this path is the  UNK  state , the ball can happen .
UNK  wine , food ,  UNK  .
thank you .
because peace is kim , it needs to  UNK  ,  UNK  disagreement between men and women .
i see young people who want to work , but they &apos;re all , you know , you know , i can see these kids , and they just follow the path that &apos;s not done , but no .
and then you &apos;re calling you , and you call you , and you have access to this huge network .
we &apos;re incredibly hard to communicate with scientists and engineers to be able to change the world .
but then i realized that the wireless doesn &apos;t actually work , because it even even though the lion &apos;s cow .
we always wondered what we know about us .
i &apos;m not going to tell you that those losses have gone .
what i want to do is here , we &apos;re going to do it .
so what happened ? in 40 years , i was in the 1900s , there was about  UNK   UNK  company .
and then you can get the water on the yellow side .
i was scared .
i &apos;m here to tell you about romantic love , a real flight which is in the love of the love of millions of women and even some men to meet every year .
and i refused to make a part of the reality that was created , which was made for me to some other people , and i was creating my reality .
one morning i can &apos;t forget .
they are real  UNK  .
i used to be a typical victim , because i don &apos;t know anything about violence , but the warning signals or its own .
what we do is working for a team -- and to do that , you have to create a social structure that exists .
we &apos;re at the final stage of the industrial revolution , with the fuel fuels ; we can &apos;t grow , and then , we have corporates systems .
all this is completely remixable with your cellphone .
i don &apos;t know it &apos;s an interesting thing to listen to your story .
some of the  UNK  students , the  UNK  books and  UNK  .
the internal combustion engine .
i was three years old when i was born , and i was so excited that there was a new person in my life .
there was a couple of times , in a long school district closed about a week for the taliban .
when you walk out of this room , you get the information about the birds , but let &apos;s your family , your children , your neighbor .
the good news from the man is a symbol of a new symbol for me and both of the boreal that when we &apos;re really needed it , and he showed me how good news and the support of international international is that the u.s. silver of us are looking for .
first of all , you have to give you the security .
i never forgot to my grandmother -- she died in afghanistan , &quot; hey , let &apos;s fight against  UNK  .
this is not a church .
with a 10,000 community , we could have about 200 aid .
and i saw them on the river .
this is in this way , which is the reason for it .
UNK   UNK  and  UNK  leopard made them thinking that i was walking around the doorbell , but actually i was sleeping sleeping on my bed .
they know their image would be seen by the people out there , like you .
i was a kid in 1984 , and i live in the city .
one day , the nightmare was the truth , i was forced to the chinese park and came to police police .
&quot; i don &apos;t help her , &quot; he said .
that &apos;s equivalent to 50,000 dollars today .
i don &apos;t care about the difference , and understand that : i &apos;ve never been lied .
thank you .
we &apos;ve got a victory in the west .
it will be  UNK  , and they &apos;re doing it right now .
our shared spaces can be better than the things that happen to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share hope , where fear and the stories that are not only possible to help us make better life , they can help us make better life .
&quot; just for the time to save the  UNK  from the hill . &quot;
it &apos;s frightening . and that &apos;s , i &apos;ve heard hear the idea of thinking out of the box , but when i actually experience something that happens to happen .
and then you have to tell them about business .
the first company , the largest company , we have to be able to be able to do three things : the product you want to have to be , you have a strong strategy , and you have to have a financial forum .
and because the  UNK  park is growing in its lap , the extracellular matrix of life decreases life .
so i &apos;m a global commander of  UNK  , this is a global improvement for education .
now you &apos;re wondering if it works .
so we can create a community where there are people who have a 3d experience of a small scale of the coffee shop in the coffee shop , and the kittens , but your friends are going to do for those who are going to ask you , &quot; what do you need ? &quot;
i could end up with my crazy romantic love by  UNK  silence .
it was a small room , where they were brothers , girls and girls , some of seven children , were forced to their customers , even though they bought more food and food .
we didn &apos;t have any infrastructure .
i also realized a huge gap between the south and north korea .
what &apos;s interesting about sustainability , is that you have to sustain it .
i was so excited to see my students to my college to the opportunity to embrace this opportunity .
and you &apos;ve got to ask yourself , &quot; if you had a  UNK  and a  UNK  yourself , you &apos;re happier ? &quot;
the murder of her woman has to be the most important thing .
your family could have been lost . you can get forced to get away from the war .
it &apos;s a lot of fun , and they share stories about the work that affected them , and they &apos;ve been in their mothers with their mothers , with three years old , and it &apos;s great .
i &apos;m an artist .
twice the number of people are taken from africa in the middle east of the pacific gyre .
they &apos;re almost not an opponent -- a husband .
we are victims .
but if if the patient could go back at home ?
this may be your story .
even i led my friends on my community , and we built these bracelets for the families that they had access to it , and i teach them how to rebuild them .
so we &apos;re  UNK  with a seed from  UNK  to italy in a beautiful valley in the valley of the river river , and we teach the people in the tomato sauce .
but instead of asking why they didn &apos;t do anything , we simply said , &quot; thank god .
it &apos;s only one of the right .
and if i can only one thing for  UNK  and for you and sam , for that , you don &apos;t have to be normal .
finally , after six months of war ii came to the coast of us to liberate our own  UNK  , and  UNK   UNK  .
the big piles of twigs are more than the children , they  UNK  them , they  UNK  them up with the surface of the timber of the timber , the rope .
but it turns out that &apos;s really hard to take a legacy of gender and the  UNK  problem while i was one of the biggest candidate .
the wolves then  UNK  the lights of today is talking about it with your kids , your coworkers , friends and family .
we see the  UNK  , the  UNK  and the
time &apos;s time for smoke , is a completely different story , and obviously it depends on the level of the spectrum .
it &apos;s more  UNK  , long .
we have these groups who support for  UNK  resources , and then we discovered that the magic of the smart owner of something like that you can challenge the cultural and economic economies of the community , only energy , and energy .
UNK  is the symbol of the  UNK  and the  UNK  serpent , and  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  for the  UNK  &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and then there was a loser .
i met him at the center of the barricades that the guards were victims .
it &apos;s low cost , and we all know what &apos;s going to happen .
these are visual images of life .
i married married to the two year-old 20 years ago , and she had three children .
and i saw their parents and their father like my dad , and their colleagues , and even while they are hallucinating .
so i thought , &quot; great . i can do anything i want , because it &apos;s my responsibility and i have to keep it . &quot;
they all did .
i was grown up in a country that was covered by the war .
thank you .
in many weeks , volunteers and volunteers people are looking for something .
the pursuit of treason and the challenge , i like how many other women ,  UNK  in the central society of the constitution , to cultivate the stability and climate change in democracy .
UNK  is information .
and i want to share some things about what people write on the wall .
he &apos;s refusing because of the water .
you have to give them security , privacy , you &apos;ve got to be excited when they help them , and they &apos;re going to go to a  UNK  crowd .
every day , we walked a different path to not have any doubts about our destination .
so what we can do is to use a  UNK  ribbon , and we cut the  UNK  out of steel , and we  UNK  this little piece of steel steel , and we embed these little  UNK  with the plastic plastic .
at the end of the road , he picks us and then drive the car .
because , you can see , it &apos;s less likely to eat the  UNK  .
now , i didn &apos;t understand , but i could feel that my dad was very , very shy .
for example , 390 mortality in the dark height , and it &apos;s about 16 km , which is about 16 km .
they kill our livestock .
but unfortunately , i don &apos;t have to tell you about 2007 , a graduate student at nyu in new york had been all the way in the stanford , and in a  UNK  that was employing that there were 10,000 people , less than four percent , it &apos;s not white .
now ,  UNK  didn &apos;t go home to a day and announced that , &quot; hey , you know , all of this kind of  UNK  and this great movie , but i needed to go to the next week where the neighbors could have heard screaming and my life , and you can see them  UNK  . &quot;
and the  UNK  , it &apos;s beautiful .
so in antarctica , you can see an example of an incredible forest .
and these projects came from questions to ask me , like , my neighbors have to pay for their apartment ?
almost 200 donors were built at  UNK  during the time and day after the dotcom winters -- almost 300 yards in  UNK  .
each son took from six to nine years , in my community , it was responsible for my left leg , but i also had to do the same thing .
my grandfather is a real guy .
that &apos;s why the white lady in africa is called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; mr. .
so i took a flask that &apos;s going to purchase a clock , and it &apos;s a little device that &apos;s found in the car , and it helps people respond to them when they want to be left or seaweed .
one year ago , i was just a little boy in the remote  UNK  for my father , and i said to myself , and i said to myself that one day , i would be sitting on the inside .
i was thrown out of the eye when i read the book , &quot; little , beautiful bumblebee , &quot; written by  UNK  , saying that all of us , in the economic growth , if people don &apos;t need help or nay .
what you should do is to fight for our autonomy today .
every spring 21 , i think , the people are good and we &apos;re working in africa .
so we have  UNK  mix with very small steel steel .
we can make the observations with the frequency frequency to get the data .
peter  UNK  is a great philosophy professor when it comes to work on business , and this is what peter  UNK  says : &quot;  UNK  is incompatible with a social and a business . &quot;
no doubt that his children will be educated , including his daughter , in the taliban , and they were  UNK  .
we can make it hard for patients .
the driving on the street in ghana , at the same time in our colleagues  UNK  , a friend of  UNK  , who sold an  UNK  ,  UNK  it , the  UNK  of the  UNK
the solution to the problem is to make these sugar palms .
for the first time , i was driving to find a secret to the secret , and i was blown away , and he was walking on a head on my head , i was constantly pounding my face .
but i &apos;m also pleased , and i &apos;m glad i think it &apos;s a blessing that i &apos;ve been before , 10 or 30 years , and i &apos;ve been working with a lot in my career , because when i could not be able to tell you how i have my first job , or maybe i &apos;m not going to be able to talk about how i have a  UNK  , or that might be so important .
it has changed two times in  UNK  .
maybe we &apos;re going to be  UNK  from washington  UNK  .
but the bars in , like , to be known in the industry , is the places of deforestation .
he told me about two things .
we have the local residents access to the  UNK  of a billion people on the planet .
i was very  UNK  .
i &apos;m not here to inspire you to the success story of creating a  UNK   UNK  and the election .
and i set up everything .
my community , the  UNK  , believe that we came from heaven , and all of our land and all the land to keep them , that &apos;s why we &apos;re taking them .
in 2009 , i lost my granddad .
it &apos;s a devastating , and he &apos;s never going to get me .
there is one out : the staircase i went in .
so this is a  UNK  .
and then there is some people you call me , they call each other .
like the same million americans , i lived in a desert desert , in the los angeles , the house in the garage , to go home with the sugar and  UNK  accidents .
hot and dracorex spread across the camera where my camera was so cold that i couldn &apos;t touch the camera .
well , i actually become an idea because i won the  UNK  , and i &apos;m a  UNK  , and you might be wondering what &apos;s bullshit .
but it &apos;s out of the  UNK  and  UNK  and knowing that the  UNK  trance is something that &apos;s truly unique : a sad instinct : a visceral instinct and a bridge , a little boy view of a memory , a human life .
i &apos;m sure that you &apos;re listening to me speak of these people who are being  UNK  or who who are being beaten when they &apos;re from drowning .
because the last step in the family  UNK  was killed .
we did a study , and we look 100 different hospitals in the carnegie world ,  UNK  , , ford , all the new company , google .
i want to leave you , because you know what ?
it &apos;s like an artist , the  UNK  for the wall , i i put in the  UNK  ,  UNK  .
let me tell you a secret .
unfortunately , after you learn it , you write  UNK  , and you &apos;ve been a couple of things , you can &apos;t say anything else , because if you say , to be president of the president of the  UNK  , the  UNK  : 10 years , &quot;
i was there in six feet under a  UNK  camp in ghana .
i had the front lines , and i had a  UNK  .
i wanted to be a whole bunch of that in which people could share .
it &apos;s about understanding the people around us in new ways .
he was very stressful at the wedding and the family for my family .
instead , i was a strong woman in love with a man , and i was the only person on the earth could help him face the face of his wife .
we perfuse the tons of birds and  UNK  from the local pharmacy factories .
and i said , &quot; yes .
a bunch of  UNK  in the trees in the tree that people don &apos;t care about ? &quot;
when i was seven , i saw my first  UNK  people &apos;s first time in my life , but i still think my life is completely normal .
if you have access to this information , you can control the whole society .
the rest of their lives are like , happy ,  UNK  with the future .
with a mobile phone , you can tell you a message on the  UNK  and start to a  UNK  balance in egypt .
how do i &apos;m going to make an electric electricity .
we started to get these pictures .
it says it &apos;s a little bit that she finds herself out of the  UNK  when it looked at the first time that &apos;s nine years ago .
in the middle of the tsunami , he was responsible for the  UNK  of the tsunami .
i watched my own intern became an educational tool , a tool for my growth .
this is the southern pacific region : the  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
this is where i live . i live in kenya in the national park in nairobi .
because nowadays , the  UNK  and company companies want to get the information that they have gotten more as possible , both online and beyond .
and we have kept asking , why don &apos;t we abandon ?
i thought , wow , i felt so bad because they &apos;re there , and i tell them , you know , these two know , don &apos;t have to do that .
and they released me out . that &apos;s a magic .
this is one of the first photos i &apos;ve ever taken , i was also the first time i took pictures of the eight , and at the time i had no longer cycle .
if you want to meet me , let &apos;s start with your  UNK  , and we &apos;ll be in something .
maybe it &apos;s an hour . it takes a week .
you all agree with me is a beautiful road .
when i was about to my birthday birthday , my wife said , &quot; why don &apos;t you take me to new york to do a new way to go to a lick and daughter and then , &quot;
these clubs are not very lucky .
so i &apos;d like to share the idea of art in a memory .
and it started out the journey of the modern world .
we &apos;re really amazed at the lesters , the  UNK  valley like this .
recently , the new york times the report that came to 100,000 children who have sex slavery in every year .
when you describe the science , look at the term .
now we taught our business school for 16 boys at  UNK  , and we started the classroom by giving them the first two  UNK  of the richard  UNK  dynasty , and the work of 16 years of the 16 , the first two weeks of the richard  UNK  , the spokes of the spokes of richard serra , &quot; how many times he said , &quot; how many times he said , &quot; how many times he collected . &quot;
for me , i &apos;ve got to wait to go home to home to really feel pain .
you have to create a new paradigm .
but if we don &apos;t change the part of the soil , we &apos;re never going to do that .
but this gun is actually a message for me , and even though he &apos;s not holding my hands on my side , my life in the moment is 45 minutes .
it &apos;s a restaurant .
after the first time , one of the police said to the other person , this is a false string .
you &apos;re doing amazing things .
but on one day of 1995 , my mother brought home a letter to one another person to do with her mother .
but what you do is the heat of steel , you take the plastic tubing , and the plastics are going to run into these little beads , and the  UNK  are going to be the walking back in the back .
you have the power to end up with a simple family simply by measuring it .
we stumbled across new york for a year later , so we decided to take another one .
we were lucky for a long time .
this is me in the same time .
we were all the  UNK  , but it was very different from the 1918 of the mushroom .
you could become the president of the united states , or , invented a keyboard for the internet , or an american poet , and the swiss army , not to be , because you &apos;re going to be the first person to do that . &quot;
it was the worst of my life .
in some of the most talented people that i was met there , i met an advocate for a foreign minister , a  UNK  member of  UNK  .
i made enough ways to take my family to come to the freedom , and they &apos;re almost like , and they &apos;ve been given them while they were arrested while we were only a  UNK  .
and on the roof plate , what i needed was recorded there .
so what that means is that people will be able to do that people can call themselves from their cell and to test this , and people who have parkinson &apos;s voice , calling their voice , and then the doctors can check their progress , to their health options .
we started dating , and he loved me to know that i was smart , that i had learned to harvard , that i was able to help her new girls and work .
however , millions of millions of people on average , and they have to live in the condition of the arts ,  UNK  , mental illness , curing mental illness and other symptoms come along with this disease . what we need to be tools for targets to detect cancer .
a mobile phone could change your life , and a cellphone on your own personal freedoms .
the story starts when i went to new york city to join a speech and my wife took a picture of my granddad in the first of the first birthday , we stood in the corner of the 1960s and five .
but they &apos;re different .
these are the images being built up , and it &apos;s used by a group of experts , but the  UNK  ,  UNK  bakeries , and the producers and their producers , and the producers , and they created this . this is not me .
he had the timber , and this big hill , the big picture of a big ball of red hair and  UNK   UNK  , and he looks very sweet .
but today , more than three million tweets in afghanistan .
that &apos;s the only way that we can go to school .
and in the words , the word &quot;  UNK  &quot; is known as in the tradition of the flag that the nucleus in arabic arabic , &quot; -- the protagonist -- the protagonist of the female and men , from each other , new tribe , born .
the sensor from apple can be  UNK  , special  UNK  .
i married him with a man and kindness , and we had three children .
no one would refuse , and fortunately is no one with her camera .
however , there &apos;s a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
but this time , i want to see the truth is that .
&quot; &apos; i &apos;m in north korea . &quot;
i can definitely say , &quot;  UNK  and &quot; don &apos;t like to use &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
tens of thousands of people have been  UNK  in agriculture , in restaurants ,  UNK   UNK  in home , and a long list .
in the culture culture , they do it very important . in places like in the west , there &apos;s no waiting to choose to die , or not there .
but this picture is not just an object for a moment , or something that is .
that would actually be a trip to the clinic , and if the patient could come from scratch , then ?
but there are hope that we could leave the house and go to the place where we were paid to some  UNK  . &quot;
how do you do that ? you can become a  UNK  , where you can write your government to talk to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these creatures that are  UNK  .
and you can see here , like 250,000 kenyan people on the street in the street , and they &apos;re  UNK  , &quot; fear . &quot;
in the 1990s , north korea .
i &apos;m not talking about the free , because free is not sustainable .
but the picture is not about yourself . they &apos;re about human beings , the real person , like you and me , all of them all the right , to respect and respect each other in the hills .
and he was , &quot; the taliban missed . &quot;
the term term we understand our idea .
i &apos;m talking about trying to work for people , and they pull their kids out of the street , and they tell them joyful joy and passion for comfort in their own food .
it &apos;s out of control , and it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a career path .
there &apos;s an entrepreneur generation who are dissidents in isolation .
after the past 33 years , i went back to libya , with  UNK   UNK  , i began to emulate the classroom training , the human skills of leadership .
there is a team of experts to come in discussing the future of new york city .
with  UNK  and  UNK  , we aimed to  UNK  the voice with a very large number of global warming to collect data and starting to four goals .
why don &apos;t i walk ? i could go anywhere .
but from the &quot; childish &quot; i &apos;ve heard hundreds of stories from men and women who have gone up , who learned a long lesson from the things that happened , and those who build the life -- happiness -- the staff , the mothers , living in life without violence , like me .
when i wrote this article , i felt very hard to find the balance balance , because of the one , i felt so hard to me , &quot; i got all of these things because i was an astronaut , &quot; and also felt really hard to follow him , but it wasn &apos;t going to make me happy . &quot;
so i helped help the  UNK  college , and the first college for girls in afghanistan , a country that still had no risk for girls .
we &apos;ve been working in 300 communities around the world .
women &apos;s  UNK  percent of parliament in the first election election in the last 30 years .
UNK   UNK  to archive is not sustainable .
in fact , in 10 years .
well , i do math math and this is an unusual problem for anyone who is an app , is that we like the  UNK  .
incredible .
they are very powerful . charles darwin said he looked at the same time that we don &apos;t know , and it turns out there .
maybe it &apos;s not just about the rise of the women , but the value of compassion , compassion , and humility .
and the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has the largest number of values that are left in the u.s.
and the first answer to me is , &quot; you don &apos;t know , not only  UNK  . &quot;
how do we share more of our memories of buildings , and they better understand better than our view ?
why science is related to us .
they collected , and they  UNK  them to regulate in places .
and he said that he needed these guns because the damage that he experienced in the past when they were a kid .
hands are going to be the father , but the green and the boys are his son .
instead , this example of this is an example of  UNK  , which is actually a little bit of it , but it shows the special structure of tissue , which is really inspiring to the unique design of the electromagnetic force .
that &apos;s what i feel like when i exchange with students , i was amazed by their ideas , and i wanted to other people have experienced this  UNK  .
we &apos;ve been working on a  UNK  task .
i asked them to send me to just one time , and i kept on demand , but what i got was just a genuine answer .
this is one of my plans . this is what i want to do .
so how do these tests based on this piece compared to the clinical trial with the clinical trial ?
on top of all ,  UNK  infections , but still was arrested at night .
the industrial industry is used to think when you talk about slave .
right .
they &apos;re all the victims of trauma , disease and violence .
settling in life is much more difficult than i imagined .
i cried .
there &apos;s no director of art , there &apos;s no samples , no hiking , not even interested in light .
i see the same as a family family , two brothers , a little bit more ?
i have to rely on democratizing immigrants to work in the system to release them , and i believe they can .
we love artists and dancing , you &apos;ll see it .
and when you talk , don &apos;t use  UNK  .
he looked at me , but fortunately , he &apos;s bad luck .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about myself and my cellphone , and about how it changed my life .
i hope you &apos;ll be able to make a power of view of people , people like you , and hopefully the power that will slow down the flame , and that &apos;s going to be  UNK  , because there &apos;s no light , there &apos;s a monster that &apos;s going to continue to live in the dark .
hello . thank you .
UNK  by  UNK  and  UNK  , they &apos;re working , working on 16 hours or 17 hours every day .
and this information is stored at least six months in europe , until two years .
and he &apos;s a very young man , this is incredibly important because he &apos;s got quieter .
i was 16 years old . i was crying . i was laughing .
and i &apos;m here today .
it &apos;s all possible with these information .
it &apos;s clear that you can talk about the science without classifying the idea .
while i was very lucky , because i was born , so many of my people were not .
in west africa has an awful  UNK   UNK  to the market markets and  UNK  .
my dog was the same as the media , and i was  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
in the lab we &apos;ve tried so many samples , and then the government , they &apos;ve been able to see results . and they said , &quot; well , how to do it . &quot;
why is that society we continue to be a society society and  UNK  by the political of the  UNK  and xenophobia , because both of the great women and women ?
i was wrong when i was the only case , and i was alone in this .
he needed them to feel .
and we needed to set up to that point before we make our lives .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to be sick anymore . &quot;
they said , we don &apos;t want to take this knowledge of personal information .
in math , i saw an opportunity that we could dispense their kids to their communities , and there &apos;s a sustainable life .
if no , young girl in the audience will not look like that anymore , and certainly it &apos;s terrible as you &apos;re outscored .
but they can monitor your car . so you &apos;re not happy with that .
i couldn &apos;t speak to talk about how i had torn out of northern ireland , but i could just say that in solitary confinement , because of starvation because i was sent to china to live with a  UNK  .
i always lived in a fear saying that my identity was going to be detected , and i &apos;m going to be paid for the old life in north korea .
the other day we woke up to news news about the american weaponry and the attacks attacked the  UNK  .
and i couldn &apos;t remember the first time i had access to autism , but i couldn &apos;t remember a single day without it .
i installed it in my family two years ago , we didn &apos;t have any problem with elephants .
my art was . i was in my work .
it &apos;s about how to create spaces and reflect , and remember that what &apos;s most important to us when we grow and change .
i realized i was fortunate enough to be able to change what you think about me for 10 seconds .
we have the opportunity to start looking at the original molecular  UNK  era before it too late .
i  UNK   UNK  .
and he said , &quot; if you want to kill me , but i &apos;m not going to leave the future of my daughter , and the &quot; paradox . &quot;
a lot . today , most of us have a mobile phone .
and so , scientists scientists and engineers , when you solve these equations , by the old , let &apos;s say hello to me .
and after a few days later , when he was driving home home , he was crying for the vehicles , and he threw the whole foods of the big bangs .
for a year , i had 27 years of the night and the government came to me , &quot; how did you do that ?
what &apos;s the trick ? you can see it on the street .
but if no one can show them , if they don &apos;t see the effect of food and their bodies , if they &apos;re not going to be anything in the front .
i thought there was a guy who was starving in africa , but then when i looked at what the americans are doing , the people who are doing , and after seeing what they do , i felt a little bit about my projects at home .
the next question that people always ask me is , &quot; can you become a big when i grow ? &quot;
i don &apos;t know he &apos;s my checklist .
and if that &apos;s the end of the  UNK  in the cold war , it doesn &apos;t exist .
this is the pattern .
that &apos;s more than 10,000 children are doing their  UNK  , they have the largest textiles in the world .
it was dark dark .
so i canceled the silence .
our society needs a national conversation with the national geographic and a half of a much more constructive , rather than the election , which makes the increase and thinner .
kofi annan is the embodiment of possibilities .
it &apos;s information about all of us .
let &apos;s take it up .
you know , you &apos;ve seen an opinion when you go back , let me tell you why .
during the last few years , there have been tremendous progress in the treatment .
bought 20,000 dollars to at-risk and special intensity and density levels that can be related to the genetic element .
and indeed , the conclusion came out of this study is that if we take the four the last four years ago -- this is the size of the telescope that we built it to be  UNK  -- if four years later , we could attenuate the lifespan of life , and of course .
today i use a little bit because i couldn &apos;t make the speech-to-text sensor from the stage .
we pulled up from the  UNK  canal .
our society , it &apos;s punctuated by the way we &apos;ve been thinking about innovation , and it &apos;s gone beyond the ideals , the principles of freedom , our rights , our societies .
i don &apos;t know what happens in that moment .
because the truth is that i was a typical victim of the family violence that i was a prisoner of domestic violence .
in fact , the slavery produces more than 13 billion annually .
i &apos;d like to take the money -- it feeds the dogs and turn them into a coffee shop .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
and how do we share more of our hope for the  UNK  shops , so our communities can reflect our needs and our dreams ?
i mean , it &apos;s how long it takes for a long kid .
it &apos;s food in the food itself .
less than a month , he and his daughter was on my way to their prison from their village , and they were just watching lions by a  UNK  in  UNK  minutes .
UNK  housing , fort housing , ready to innovate and resilience .
you &apos;re surprised to see how the children are affected .
but the next answer that i really wanted to tell you about girls , &quot; why ? &quot;
i was very proud of my country .
i live in the south .
the man i loved more people out of the gun and the murder of death , i know how i was born .
two words : a word &quot;  UNK  &quot; means , &quot; means . &quot;
so you &apos;ve got this scholarship . yes .
i was 22 years old .
can you imagine the  UNK  community , with smart intelligence .
together a great group , i took the  UNK  of women women majoring of peace , women leaders from each other disciplines in society , to empower the political coalitions for women and to fight their rights for the democratic republic of democracy and peace .
when we got the images from us , she shares her a story .
this is an incredible power , but it &apos;s also a fake .
let &apos;s go back at that time , at the city .
however ,  UNK  has to be a burden , a legacy of oppression , corruption and  UNK  .
finally , our dream has been accepted and success .
but that doesn &apos;t just talk about me .
i was completely despair .
tell you what you heard about here .
and then finally , the red cross will hatch .
storm slavery are almost everywhere in the world , whether it &apos;s illegal .
we have eight  UNK  on in kenya , including six endangered endangered risk .
the first question is : what ?
you can &apos;t get worse worse , and that &apos;s from charles darwin .
i &apos;m south korea or north korea ?
you can give someone an idea .
do you with your  UNK  , ok ?
this  UNK   UNK  in this picture , it &apos;s got to be recorded by hand , or  UNK  , and from the rest of the surface .
but when the printing press , i experienced something that alice alice was born when she fell down to breathe and found the window to a new world .
they have nothing to compare .
this is a telecom company in europe , every home provided the internet service to the european union , it has to be a huge amount of information about users .
and i &apos;m going to here to admit that we -- the whole country was wrong , decided to make mistakes .
our society needs to be  UNK  from the population than the numbers and numbers of the population .
i hadn &apos;t been what happened to the life of a refugee from the south pole , but i soon realized that it &apos;s not difficult , but also , dangerous , because the refugees from the north of the country in china is considered to the immigrants of immigrants .
this is the first panel .
in fact , if you want to meet me , you know , if you want to go , don &apos;t remind me if you want  UNK  on the couch and join the meeting where you talk about it .
there &apos;s written : when it &apos;s just read these lines , both of their fathers have no longer stand on this side , because they have nothing to eat for two weeks .
today i have a requirement .
when i was working in this field , i brought in a lot , so , for the help of people , i applied to the people that i wanted to take their own stories and their context , and then they were safe and i was safe .
i was with my group , but the  UNK  green roofs , we walked together and started in the woods of the food industry : the oil plant .
we &apos;re telling them to talk about the  UNK  necessary for the of of these beautiful creatures and the benefits that they carry .
my father was listening to the bbc on the radio .
and if you use the cell phone , it &apos;s where the problem exists .
but the worst thing to me was in the first meeting , he was an apprentice and he looked like a farmer .
because if they saw something that &apos;s not natural , i &apos;m going to be put in the back then and then get paid .
when you &apos;re an injection cost per dollar , you give you an amount of an equivalent to 75 dollars .
i also hundreds of volunteers volunteers to understand that you can &apos;t sit at home , so i decided to join them in three weeks .
so i asked the house , using  UNK  , the  UNK  service provider at the time , and i asked them , please , give me the whole information that they had stored .
so today i want to encourage everybody to be in the picture , and don &apos;t leave me to give someone to someone , and said , &quot; what do you make us ? &quot;
we want to have autonomy in the digital technology , and we don &apos;t want to stop that the telecommunications industry and the service providers all of our information .
and the little boys , was that he was arrested in the lake .
this is live when it &apos;s the natural border between north korea and china .
my mother became a teacher .
so in order to make the first step towards this , we &apos;re working on the  UNK  conference .
some of them are my home .
the whole idea is .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to be  UNK  . &quot;
he told us to walk on the highway path into the woods .
UNK  , michigan . henry ford .
according to a breath in the koran , &quot;  UNK  , &quot; the word of god &apos;s genius ,  UNK  . &quot;
he had to go back to the tip of the air force .
don &apos;t take a community with the ideas , you &apos;re sitting with the same .
during this time , we hadn &apos;t just a thousand dollars for the device and the material , most of the costs are the printer .
&quot; before i die , i &apos;d like to sing for millions of people . &quot;
i moved to new york city when i was doing my first job and writing the magazine magazine .
it &apos;s built from asphalt , and it &apos;s a kind of  UNK  material that run on it , but it wasn &apos;t always been so special , but not to be like today .
i was in the temperature more than training , c , men , women , all of families , being registered in the  UNK   UNK  , heating the first railroads , and i put them off a plate , and i handed them from coffee shop .
and all over the world , just 20 minutes more than a diagnosis of autism , and even though it &apos;s one of the developmental developmental developmental at the fastest rate in the world , we don &apos;t know what or treatment .
i want them to know that we &apos;re going to do them them , and we &apos;re going to do whatever they can help them change their lives .
no , no .
so what is it going to be ?
so this space is  UNK  into a complete space , and hope , and the dreams of people make me to come up , and tears themselves in their face .
he didn &apos;t start alone .
it was absolutely revolting .
you can see that there &apos;s a very clear that there &apos;s a very clear that there &apos;s a little bit that there are a lot of  UNK   UNK  of china .
death is something that we &apos;re not not encouraged to speak or even thinking , but i &apos;ve realized that &apos;s going to be dead for one of the most powerful things you can do .
i believe you &apos;re going to be able to see more people in north koreans in the world , including the ted stage .
as a  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , and was forced back to the slave in this open .
until december , 2011 , i made my breath for the new york city .
i was shocked .
although i ever wondered what the outside world looks like , but i still think i &apos;d live my life in my money , until all of a sudden .
i used to ask myself , in fact , does it work ?
i was very fortunate to be teaching in a very small family , and to be asked .
wrong . they were slaughtered .
the first time came out there , i was walking around .
and the picture is something called you something or something , a place , a relationship , a person .
there &apos;s no  UNK  .
we have the same idea of victims as victims , but from women who have been hurt .
and there &apos;s also a similar system works .
tom  UNK  : so the hurdy-gurdy , by taking all the markers for 10,000 people , who can tell someone who &apos;s healthy and who ?
you can see the most popular parts , like the leaders of a group .
i still remember looking at the eyes of their eyes , because their people were under the floor floor .
and when we do that , nobody knows ?
they read it from a african woman , but the damage that we have .
as you can see , the battery battery uses to the battery , and it &apos;s battery -- you &apos;re going to get the energy out there . i call it  UNK  .
he gives us the  UNK  of compassion .
every year on the floor , and maybe we would love to be able to feel like a dead zone .
we need to start acting like compassion and tolerance .
i &apos;d like to share some of the secret to do that we find that science science is very attractive , smart technology is unimaginably attractive .
you can zoom in , or maybe it , you can scroll back back or faster .
she asked her two years ago to stop our home to open her school to girls and girls in her neighbors .
thank you .
my new school is now starting to help themselves and raising awareness .
and i realized that one of the most important things we create is memory .
but it &apos;s raining .
you know what you can &apos;t be anyone .
i want to talk to you about a special group of animals .
a lot of people are deceived by suicide bombers  UNK  education , better work , only to find themselves not to work without violence in violence , and no escape .
when i was 11 years old , i remember one morning i woke up in my home .
but you can see how we communicate with each other , they call each other , when they go to sleep .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to be kind of  UNK  on the streets . &quot;
thank you .
it was in the last season , and imagine the people who stood up and saw the change that would have a mobile phone in the bag .
we were able to make a  UNK   UNK  with the cost of the cost to test clinical trials , which is possible for the first time in the first time .
thank you very much .
every year , there are thousands of north korea who are in china and belgium to water , where they are tortured or stolen .
this is the  UNK  region .
it &apos;s also a place where the  UNK   UNK
this is a way to explore social media because you know how to speak with someone , who has sent to email , all that can be if you have access to this information .
so what i &apos;m talking about is the status quo is that it is .
the reason is that they are being trafficked , they &apos;re infected by having a combination of people -- and the wild , the communities that are using this toxic to try to access to the predators , but also  UNK  victims .
in fact , my students ,  UNK  , i took him to him , because he did something wonderful , he suggested that this could be done , and that was exactly the 99 percent .
not everybody has an opportunity to do this .
and i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
and it &apos;s a little clockwork from a pipe .
thank you .
but the  UNK  world is found in the united states , like  UNK   UNK  and  UNK   UNK  around the world , where there are 16 years old .
so i grew up with the invasion of lions .
i said to myself , i was the rest on the earth with the man who bombed him , but in fact , i was a  UNK  victim .
because even though we had an image , but our view of change , and my daughter had been a new oil , and i looked at her life life , and it was looked at the same direction and interact with things .
and so the l.a. &apos;s got a message , steve  UNK  wrote a paper about it , and you with the public planner , and then one of the members of the blue bars send a petition in  UNK  , and with  UNK  , we succeeded .
in addition , i took the coins with everybody else other cultures like my  UNK  .
thank you .
and the second thing i want to say that people think the violence violence is with women , that &apos;s the problem with women .
where i want you to be a  UNK  when i grew up like a kid when you want to be bad when they grow up .
UNK  is one of the most vulnerable birds .
but then i realized , this is my whole life .
it &apos;s like it doesn &apos;t work for special .
in india and nepal , i was introduced a brick .
UNK  is love .
no , they &apos;re not going to find it to you .
older women sometimes never saw a scanner , but after 10 minutes , to find out of a cloud , to put down a cloud into a cloud , a stranger , somewhere in the world , and started to be  UNK  .
a lot of african-americans are struggling with their families , and when they come to a different country , they start to start with a little bit or less .
do they know for us ?
but i took my memory back to the things that they taught me about character , my communication and love and i realized that this is what i &apos;m not going to do not to be normal .
i &apos;m not a mental illness , not a  UNK  society or a professional expert .
i &apos;m just a woman who wanted to share my story .
i went back to the middle of the room and the police department , to find a way to take my family out of it , but i didn &apos;t have enough money to pay for bribery .
we took the face .
sadly , disorders like parkinson &apos;s disease , it &apos;s going to happen to you  UNK   UNK  , who once , once , once met a suicide bombers .
i think these are some of the secret that helped us open the door , and we speak to the critic of science and technology .
these guys have been buried in the middle of the square in a different area of ghana .
i &apos;d like to give up to school , but my father , he would say , &quot; listen , she could lose everything on her life .
when i was a teenager , i sat in a car who was a very young person who had a very stiff person , and she was able to go back , and all of what i did was saying , &quot; sorry , &quot; we were able to walk .
rapid speeds , just about 30 seconds .
i was able to walk away , because a  UNK  ceremony that ended up my  UNK  .
we &apos;re going to change the concept of  UNK  .
a slide like this , not only but it &apos;s not just too much dependent on the language of the brain , which makes us sweet .
the commissioner commissioner is even going to call me and said that they trusted and love what we &apos;re doing .
we &apos;ve got about 50 people to join me , and they all are .
if the photographer &apos;s right here at the same light in the light , again , like this is a beautiful interaction , and when the client said , &quot; oh , we &apos;re going to want to be able to walk around , you know , it &apos;s going to go ahead of this , anywhere in three quarters , and then you just go back to you , imagine that your friends , 300 , 400 years .
so , the first thing i want to talk to you about is that violence is happening with all the people , every religion , every level of income and education .
what i did was in a food forest in front of the house .
i fear that all these changes are not going to be less than the u.s.
there are men , they helped me out of the truck .
and he also created the atmosphere of our trust in our way by kofi his mysteries , that he was a child from the age four years old , and he was terrible enough to make him at the age of puberty , although he was smart and he took a long 20 years to build their lives .
we need to measure more progress , and ultimately , the only way that we know when we actually have a treatment , is , when we have an  UNK  heart .
when i was a kid , i think the money was the best country in the world , and i would sing songs , &quot; we don &apos;t have anything . &quot;
peter  UNK  , one of the greatest leadership in history , died in the age of years , a few years ago .
what do you expect ?
how do you make your list on your list ?
he wanted to know everything about my family and about my childhood , my hope and my dreams .
it took a week , she finds them and knew that they all survived .
i helped to  UNK  the public spaces , the big  UNK  .
and in the  UNK  years , the group of people came together , and the prediction about what would happen to new york city for the next 100 years , and the consensus was like : the new york city will not exist in the next 100 years .
when it comes out of the  UNK  , the  UNK   UNK  .
the first idea that i got to be  UNK  , because i was scared .
they look for pictures and photos and photos and  UNK  .
at the beginning of the united states .
we , the nations cartel cartel has led to africa for two billion suns in the last 50 years .
it started  UNK   UNK  , so few weeks later , i flew to los angeles to meet the u.n.  UNK  and proposed to help them .
that &apos;s why after 10 years of the oil spills , i decided to go to south korea , to start a new life .
you can see how the story is coming .
when you grow up , you get closer , and the difference gets worse .
i don &apos;t know the second phase was isolated .
okay , you could it ? you can &apos;t pay for money ?
when something gets tougher , it &apos;s going to be popular .
over time , a lot of time , a lot of photos are sent back , and they need to get the  UNK  , and again , again , i &apos;ve been on facebook and  UNK  , in the next decade , i find the 80 people who wanted to help from 12 different countries .
if you have access to this information , you can see the activity of the community , society .
UNK  can affect your daughter , your girlfriend , your closest friend &apos;s day .
you can see here how many thousands of people who stand up and  UNK  to change .
and there are millions of individuals in another individual , that &apos;s why it &apos;s very strange .
one day we got to the news of the  UNK  and the  UNK  of the
i wanted all of us to be  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
accepting the early signal of violence and the  UNK  of conscience , down it down .
i was so scared , and i felt like i was going to explode .
we can do that many times .
i was so surprised to a stranger who was interested in response to me .
i lived in new york , and last year , in the  UNK  of  UNK  teenager and arrested , there were 86 percent of blacks and young people .
all of this information is stored at least six months , waiting for two years ago , you &apos;re using the service provider .
you need to go to the hospital to do that . it &apos;s very costly , it means that the test is out there in clinical trials , it never has done .
thank you .
i know that the fence have been invented , but i wanted to do their own work .
the africans are like the  UNK  ,  UNK  , and we only have two ways to treat other people : or  UNK  , or
when i  UNK  my hand , i was small to the people who were able to come up with a few years ago , and  UNK  down the stairs .
the problem is that the land is the city .
however , once you get a little bit further , the from the election and the revolution of the  UNK  the -- the day when we woke up with the news of violence .
we were able to make the  UNK  , the more beautiful ,  UNK  , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able ,
the cause is due to summer , the european european commission proposed an official .
here we have a video of doodles .
now , all these pictures have been damaged water , dominated by the saltwater , dominated by the bacteria , sometimes in the oil , sometimes a whole period of time , they &apos;re going to keep on . there &apos;s a big part of the project .
i did this project last year , and i started to get hundreds of letters from people who want to make a wall in their community , so in the middle of the center of the center and i was an engine , and now the walls are being done in the world in the world , including south africa , australia ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
if you don &apos;t , but as husbands and her face , it &apos;s never going to be able to get compounded , they can put them closer together in another photo , and then the whole whole picture .
and that &apos;s true , but it &apos;s just half of that , because what we &apos;re never going to say before the lens , which i never said before the lens , which is : &quot; i &apos;m afraid . &quot;
this is a picture from the cassini van  UNK  in night with the surroundings .
so i had to figure out how to address this problem .
from the audio , we actually have a  UNK  on the front page where the forest is , when you &apos;re being affected by parkinson &apos;s disease , the sounds are  UNK  .
and especially if you &apos;re a bicycle , and crossing crossing these cars are real .
because that &apos;s the first time i knew that my people are suffering .
this was taken a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and i tried to explain what that happened to a few years ago .
i listen to speak , but it &apos;s almost a spike of  UNK  and they &apos;ve been detected by the tools .
but it &apos;s also selection .
this is one of those who had been killed in the morning , and when i woke up in the morning i found it was dead , and i felt very sad , because that &apos;s the only dad that we have .
we &apos;re trying to identify our basic ecology , and in the oil where they come .
because my family didn &apos;t know the chinese , so i had to go across every year , to china , to china .
entrepreneurs who never come to , and they don &apos;t even know you , in the community meeting , what they wanted to do with their money , the opportunity they were finding .
but nobody who helped them , because they &apos;re all concerned about themselves and family .
and then  UNK  lions and killed .
finally , after a long tour of my family and family was reunited with the koreans , but come to the freedom to be a half of the fight .
i know that there are some of you who have this point , and maybe there &apos;s some beautiful forms of like , &quot; wait .  UNK  .  UNK   UNK  . punish  UNK  . &quot;
i hope you can see -- these pictures are not images .
we don &apos;t work from the office .
and the answer is very easy .
there is no one day i don &apos;t think about these wonderful people , i have a great honor to meet them .
the other day we woke up with the political scandal .
one of the  UNK   UNK  from a prisoner from afghanistan , he  UNK  to his daughter , my mother was to school , and because he was his father .
UNK  ? forget !
at that time , i just thought i &apos;d go to a short time .
the final question that people ask me is , &quot; how do you feel ? &quot;
they came to the first day and see the  UNK  , and then they go back , but the second day , they come and said that this isn &apos;t just there .
on the top of the queen is a two-year-old , who are still holding a little kid , and a kid who knows even looking at the face of her face .
thank you .
you know , 20 minutes , i have to go back to the bathroom to go to the device and get them down below the fuel temperature , and when i sit there , i think , my camera is better than the other people .
how do they do not ?
i &apos;d like to give them off the light .
the moon is given up to the length of 24 meters , and go over three miles away from the land .
i couldn &apos;t directly directly to help them .
then i got a little bit , what should i do with it ?
i realized that was a huge difference in my life .
i met these boys at the morning at the morning , when they &apos;re peeling their final nets , but they &apos;ve been working at one hour .
many women  UNK  on the back in the back in the back of the back , and the line of the water  UNK  .
you know , you put your camera for a single person who is totally alien to all around the world .
so what &apos;s the  UNK   UNK  ?
and i wondered , how do you feel how to have food food , when every time you take away from your eyes to the food system where the operating system is operating ?
i &apos;m not saying , but you &apos;re interested in ways in the way that even some of the best  UNK  are unable to do .
i truly believe , if we take another person as well as the human beings , then it &apos;s very difficult to be  UNK  .
so in  UNK  , they saw this  UNK  technology that makes the life in new york city .
in  UNK  summers ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  , he was 20 years to save  UNK   UNK  from the  UNK  .
i have a lot of  UNK  shoes that i have never been carrying , but this is the exception , but the free stuff that i got in the real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t want to talk about .
&quot; why people don &apos;t tell us before ? &quot; you &apos;ve ever asked . &quot;
why do i do this ?
and there &apos;s also a historic history of view .
now , i was 22 , i graduated from harvard graduate school .
i was feeling very comfortable at the time , and photographer  UNK  me to wear the back and put his foot on his hair .
i always wondered , why do they have no longer us .
we can also play the same as the bridge between the people who are in north korea in the outside world , because there are so many of us in the contact with other family members in the country , and we share with information and money to change the border from the medina .
i &apos;m betting today .
gratitude is that i &apos;ve come to most of these places .
it &apos;s not big enough .
well , to get back up , i can say that we &apos;ve created a synthetic biomaterial , adding the steel , to use the flow of the ladder , which is that the length of life is something that even if you can do it , increase the same length of telemetry very simple .
and these two little boys , i don &apos;t remember anymore , two sons son are in school , two different schools .
and i helped these guys know how to work together and you have these tuna tuna at the  UNK  factory with a  UNK  , but we find how to you to beat them to 15 dollars a month , and then the farmers who come to , to say , &quot; hey , he helped help us ? &quot; can you help us ? &quot; can you help us ? &quot; can you help us ? &quot;
the autonomy and living in the digital technology is not conflicting .
so they killed lions .
this child is eight .
together , we &apos;ve shown our public space where we have access to the opportunity to have a voice and share more with another person .
over a hundred million volunteers that helped save more than the families , hundreds of photos were completely  UNK  and  UNK  .
but  UNK   UNK  said , no , we won &apos;t give you this information .
i could feel raven from the waist down in the dark , but i couldn &apos;t even better .
the worm worm that i spent hundreds of meters , they took the trees that were  UNK  to transfer them to the other area , where they were released .
he &apos;s not greedy . he &apos;s not sampling .
this is one of six after having been killed in nairobi .
please don &apos;t tell me that i was normal .
i don &apos;t want to play like other babies , and in fact , i don &apos;t seem to be interested in anything else .
and there &apos;s an idea that there &apos;s an idea that we &apos;ve got a sense of understanding , but that &apos;s always been understanding .
it &apos;s happening everywhere .
and once again , our car has been dismantled and neglected by a national park .
UNK  came up to me once two times every week for six months and half years .
we see all the symptoms .
this is  UNK  . when he died , he &apos;s been to the owner of the  UNK  .
i can &apos;t imagine that i would have to pass them for 14 years .
but the effective effective can &apos;t happen if science and engineer can &apos;t invite them into their door .
they pasted me down the stairs down to the  UNK  basement , in the  UNK  .
i tell people : the  UNK  , my friends , friends and family dinners , and i stand here today because you &apos;re helping me .
there &apos;s only one thing that all of the world is successful in the world , there is a company that &apos;s not a company that begins with only one person .
more than 85 percent of the terror is the men , and violence is just within the heterosexual relationship , the  UNK  , where , in the family , the in the family , where we finally want to believe that violence violence is an emotional cause .
i led to an incredible courage of  UNK  women &apos;s leading to the lobby for a better answer , which is able to bring citizens to the citizens , whether they &apos;re all , and their rights , and most importantly , the most important political parties in the united nations and women in the list created the  UNK  .
we &apos;re the other animal here . it &apos;s pretty smooth .
and i had a switch that i could turn off and open up .
they &apos;re inanimate objects , and our story , is the last thing we &apos;re  UNK  , and the first thing we go back .
it &apos;s done .
this is my view , took her three months ago .
in the last two weeks , i had 150 million people want to participate .
to her , after all the time , these images are the perfect gift for him , something that &apos;s going to be able to recall , to remember the past before christ , when the whole life is being destroyed .
even though it &apos;s going to adapt to life in south korea , it &apos;s not easy , but i made a plan .
thank you very much .
my family was not poor , and myself , i had never been hungry .
but why are those information here ?
we were a group of people who were sharing at the same time , some of the people from many different lives , from each other in the city , and they were completely wrong , and everything we were going to be free .
look at all the time .
yes , it &apos;s almost like all the photos are made , but it &apos;s just a small element of what &apos;s going on .
so a few years ago , i was trying to make more ways to share my neighbors in the public space , using simple tools like paper , paper and  UNK  .
i didn &apos;t think that i had jumped into a romantic love , that i was walking in the first steps to the  UNK  , the money , and the
they &apos;ve been  UNK  with a superstar culture .
and in this picture , i actually had no recollection in the real life .
when the police came to close to me , i was immediately to stand up and told him that this was the deaf man that i was facing .
nobody knows what we did .
i don &apos;t divide the energy , but we need to cooperate with government , because the engine that keeps the birds to these birds .
and you have to struggle to think about it every day .
she describes her in a sense of age , when i was standing in the right position .
i &apos;d like to read an email for this talk , email from  UNK  , someone who helped me to send me back to the next morning .
i can put them into the worse than they are .
this morning , this guy &apos;s put it in a house , and he said , &quot; could we be able to imagine how a city is not a new form ?
you can be extraordinary .
i was  UNK  on the highway , there was an article that was written , and i felt shy , my  UNK  use of my fingers as well as well as well as i had my hands , and i was dragging my fingers as i could never breathe or screaming , and he stopped  UNK  my head on the wall .
when this village is free , their  UNK   UNK  .
thank you , tom .
i got the free stuff that i remember , depending on my view , not because i am , and there are people who are willing to spend a lot of money on their appearance , not because they are .
a tree under the sleeping of our sleeping transplant bridge , he &apos;s always in the middle .
there &apos;s an amazing story that i read on a  UNK  forbes article ago years ago .
the person is supposed to be  UNK  sex with their hands .
so i was actually in the very good company .
the message of their stories .
the theme is the secret of domestic violence , and the question i asked is the question that people always wondered : why are she still fighting ?
almost two years ago at the time in libya when it was , in addition to  UNK  by a series of  UNK  on the  UNK  in egypt in egypt and egypt .
so they can quickly quickly out of that , i started my family planning .
another year when i was at night in a homeless in los angeles los angeles .
and this is me now .
so what happened ?
i think my life come forward , but i still try to control their feelings and answering their questions .
UNK  is used in the process process .
for some people , they were connected to something that &apos;s something , and then something else , to do something else , but there is something that can be small and small skin .
and then they gave us a  UNK  path of  UNK  , which is about 400 kilometers from  UNK  , and we have to build a prototype of these new prototype .
the national park can be censored censorship in the south in the south , which means that the wild animals appear to escape from the park .
this is how i help other victims , and this is my final request .
it &apos;s not going to give you an old man , and then i showed you how it works .
because this is not this .
these are the ideas that we need for the country that has been devastating as tragic as an exception in absolute absolute order to be able to get around .
where do we use your mobile phones ?
but one thing is going to happen to be the stuff , and if we were forced to have to have to have to sell to the south african , we &apos;re going to do that .
and so the animals eat like lions , and this is what leopard seals did .
now what &apos;s happening in new york is the universities , because it decided to go in new york .
because the border from northern north korea is not possible , so i had to fly to china to the north pole in the north border .
but then i said , i wanted to have these information , because they were saving my life .
i met mahmoud in january , and rain .
in 1962 in 1977 -- 1977 -- i &apos;m not doing that -- i was working in zambia to kenya , kenya , algeria , algeria , somalia , in the coordination projects with african countries .
it &apos;s time-consuming .
but then i said , i wanted to get this information .
some of the south african china came to the u.n. department of refugees to refugee refugees , but many of them have been arrested by the chinese police and got paid about water .
that &apos;s about knowing that you don &apos;t just have one .
it &apos;s a sponge , as i said , you just have a small amount of scissors with the candidates .
is a list of  UNK  and a  UNK  between between the candidates and women who have peace and peace for the country ?
well , it &apos;s a little bit about the difference that the difference you for us and how we don &apos;t think it &apos;s not one of us .
what i never have half anymore , forever is a gun in my head because he said that he loved me .
&quot; before i die , i want to live out . &quot;
they &apos;re the way that we spend our time in a week of chicago , thinking about our time and how we changed in every year , not just about the physical , but also everything .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest you is a traditional way that we can achieve this , because as you can see , at least in a certain way , we &apos;re  UNK  like  UNK   UNK  .
now , i lived in new orleans , and i was in new orleans .
and when we were in the ukraine , we asked the same answer .
electricity is more often , so everything that surrounds me all the dark night in the dark until the light comes from china to a boat .
in south asia , countries like india and pakistan , four  UNK  are recorded in the list of high resolution , which means that they &apos;re only less than 10 or 15 years to slow down to the extinct , and that &apos;s because they &apos;re turned into new drugs because of the drugs were treated with their  UNK  .
this is life in my next month , was recorded in all this data .
i was in an incredibly difficult situation , the environment environment , an environment that was founded by the political political  UNK  and  UNK  .
the first thing i looked at it , and said , &quot; ok . it &apos;s a big list of big data . good .
the worst part of this is , because when you smile , so don &apos;t do anything like when it was on my head .
so that is exactly what is the percentage ?
now my idea was developed on across kenya in order to other mammals , like , and it &apos;s also used to prevent the herd of the vehicle .
scientists and engineers are experts who are working with the challenges challenges , from energy to the health and health , and more of them , if we don &apos;t understand that , that &apos;s not going to work , and i believe our responsibility , the people who are interacting with them .
five years ago , i had experienced a little bit like alice alice .
we &apos;ve never met a single individual in the world , who you could do , you owe it .
do they have been watching ?
they &apos;re going to be  UNK  in a horse .
it &apos;s actually like you can see that these materials have damage .
more than that .
i &apos;ve been in many villages in india , where many families are being expelled in landfills .
because there isn &apos;t that there should be  UNK  on the number of rice in the middle of the animals that when you have the  UNK  , you have a giant  UNK  of  UNK  .
it turned out to us .
but the sad is that with parkinson &apos;s disease and bipolar disorder , they don &apos;t have  UNK  , so there &apos;s no simple method that can you do , and the best way that we have this memory .
we &apos;re going to have a guy on your streets , you remember .
the first project , my first inspiration inspired to my first book , &quot; but living from  UNK  , &quot; is a project in which he decided to teach the  UNK  in food .
when i was 27 years old , i decided to give up with people , and i created a system called  UNK   UNK  , where you &apos;re not going to have anything you would never meet , but to become a  UNK  for the  UNK  , the people who had the dreams who have dreams who want to become a better person .
on december 24th , i went to the streets to the town .
how are you going to be someone if you ever stand up and change your life ?
i &apos;m going to be  UNK  , and they &apos;ll give me the information that i asked .
i started as an experiment in  UNK  , west australia .
now , i didn &apos;t know that the first phase of the violence is the temptation and the victims .
and in europe , the people stood up and said , &quot; we don &apos;t want to be . &quot;
i feel like that it &apos;s easy to be  UNK  in the day , and forget the fact that really matters to you .
i grew up in cambridge , and at the time , i went to my shop , and i forgot that i gave them a free shirt .
a school .
i need to note that these are heavy  UNK  when they are .
it was never &quot; from me , &quot; and we said , &quot;
i &apos;m using the garden , put in a like a few , and the trees and the forest is what i put out there .
UNK  , i was treating to any other from the culture , as they were me , &quot; i love them too . &quot;
and every day , every day we woke up the rules of the  UNK  forces and our overblown  UNK  about the people with inmates .
with a mobile phone , you could record images of the  UNK  of the rights of the human rights .
we raised our books in the same way that people think we &apos;ll just go shopping .
and i thought about a lot of dying , and this amazes me feel gratitude , but for the time that i had , and to give clarity for what was meaningful for my life .
if you &apos;re not a  UNK  , you &apos;re not  UNK  .
stand at the time , there was a man man asked me , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
the old man , the people who are  UNK  . that &apos;s what you &apos;re clapping .
we said to the  UNK  , &quot; god , these  UNK  ! &quot;
she had her copy of her picture .
the woman brought us these photographs who were lucky , when they were able to recover .
they had a mirror of compassion in  UNK  with the dictator of  UNK  dictator .
ask scientists and engineers , or  UNK  with us .
one is bathed in the water .
thank you .
we have great  UNK  . in italy , a coconut one is only about about this ice . it &apos;s a piece of it .
and after a few months , i realized that i was different .
my family believed me .
but yeah , i &apos;m here to be an academic graduate student .
and then it was just in the  UNK  , and she said , &quot; this is it out . &quot;
because at the time , the supreme court , the federal constitution that the european union is not selectively in the constitution of the germans .
the air is around and dust , and it &apos;s brittle .
this book was written in 2009 .
the first question is , how do i become a ?
you just need to meet a single group , because they have the highest foot , and the largest  UNK  , and they are the most knowledgeable women on the planet .
afghanistan looks very different from the u.s.
we met at a coffee shop .
some people even don &apos;t even know if they were  UNK  , they didn &apos;t work 16 , 17 hours per day , because they were only .
then you have to bring them to an opponent , separate and  UNK  .
so on a night , i took a tree walking around my father , on that day , but she &apos;s not black .
instead , as  UNK   UNK  said : the whole thing is , the better
it made more than a million deaths in the hunger , and many people unnecessarily survive , and disintegrating .
they are the birds .
but don &apos;t turn turn into a kind of  UNK  . &quot;
then , when you go back home , please tell your friends that the privacy is a 21st-century value , and that &apos;s not obsolete .
what i do , and what i do about doing my life -- my life -- was raised for the seven years of south africa .
UNK   UNK  . in my language , it means that thank you very much .
&quot; before i die , i want to complete myself . &quot;
the peacekeepers who protect our communities and prisons , we &apos;re very concerned about this problem .
how do you distribute the technology for the industrial revolution ? the universities ?
i went through a crisis of our origins .
hello . this is my cellphone .
because it &apos;s been arrested , but at the end , it &apos;s also taken out of the from the international community .
there &apos;s a lot of ways that people around us can help improve our lives .
but this sounds like this might be hard to detect , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and use the analytics analysis to combine the newest machine , which is critical now that we could predict predict how to lie to lie in any mental health system .
these girls have been lucky .
so the city planners meet together and they &apos;re going to see the names for it to make a different name , so they &apos;re hungry into the los angeles , and that &apos;s going to be solved in the city .
and my second idea is that  UNK  .
i want to leave you about your own . it &apos;s the impression .
and beavers , you also have a lot of noise .
i believe that the key to the doors to the world is the ability to communicate .
too , you don &apos;t wear hats , and because of being treated from small , you &apos;re going to put it down to the smaller islands that they manage .
if there is something that happens to this conversation , i hope it &apos;s all of us to feel more comfortable when the power of the visual perception of our success and our failure .
so -- so the government said to me , &quot; come on . &quot;
you don &apos;t have a chance to make mistakes .
since i was a kid , i used to work in my room , and i even had the radio radio jewelry , and then she was nearly killed me , but i learned a lot about electricity .
thank you .
&quot; oh , no , i can &apos;t do this . &quot; do you want me to find somebody else ? &quot;
why should women be fighting to their subscribers ?
they have a long time .
so i went to facebook and ask some people , and come to the morning , i got a lot of positive feedback , i know .
and the cat here is to use smart questions and easy to read the audience can be based on that if they don &apos;t work , and then you can use some of the sensory insights to help us understand more deeply .
we can &apos;t fix if you can &apos;t get clean books , lung  UNK  and  UNK  .
now , why is it important ? well , they provide the basic services . they are .
in the taliban , i remember that there were moments when i was angry angry about our lives and always fear and not .
it &apos;s not about the rise of staff .
the next question that people always ask me , &quot; well , all of you are all right ? &quot;
so this is an amazing number that i think we can do now .
and i feel that there &apos;s a pressure pressure in the room because i &apos;m not supposed to wear this .
i wanted it to be known by the public .
so after the talk , i saw this terrible , and really embarrassing shame because of this incident in my life , and i thought , if i didn &apos;t know , how many people don &apos;t know ?
today i &apos;m here to talk to talk about a compelling question that the answer is irrelevant .
the secret is , this gun is towed in  UNK  , from the beginning of the men who i thought was a spouse , from the next time .
nine years ago . yes , it &apos;s a progress .
and finally , i had a deal with them .
and the idea is that it &apos;s not to take them .
but we &apos;re going to take a huge amount of data that &apos;s collected from all different cases , and the results in different cases is important because we then look at random elements , and seek out the actual signals of this disease .
you &apos;ll be able to discover what the land could do if you put them into a cloth .
i feel embarrassed to look at the people that i was close to me , and that &apos;s more than the reason to do this . people ask me , &quot;  UNK  , are you not afraid of your food ? &quot;
what &apos;s interesting is that food is speeding up to the road , and it &apos;s more people dying than the accident .
you have to learn how to make these people come to talk to you .
less than six percent of women are born after high school , and if my family didn &apos;t know about my learning , i became one of them .
as i said , if i started to imagine , if all of these people on the street in the streets were in a  UNK  cell phones .
she had many cattle were killed , and she asked me whether i could help three  UNK  .
that &apos;s the equivalent of the central park .
so with the help of the old friends and new , i moved on the side of the building building into a giant patchwork , and to make it a crazy trick -- to say , &quot; i want to ... &quot; to anyone who can go through the body &apos;s possible , their own lives , and share their own partners in public public spaces .
richard  UNK  , i was different .
my  UNK  team used to say : it &apos;s like a tattoo .
we don &apos;t don &apos;t count around , so there &apos;s a lot of a lot of extinction , never knowing that , even though we also share public spaces .
the first principle of aid is respect .
one third woman has been working with their families , or  UNK  in some of their lives and report that shows 15 million children to kill every year , 15 million .
i &apos;m not to citizen .
we were scared , but we still wanted to go to school .
and i stood on the stage because i was an organism .
well , dancing is one of the activities that people seem to do .
my belief believe me , like a writer and a woman in which nobody had ever had .
in a tree will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
however , after we crossed the border , my family was arrested in prison because i had the  UNK  .
when i went back to afghanistan , my grandfather , surrounded by the family because he was to his daughter , was one of my first  UNK  .
from here , the  UNK  trees .
they want to be able to be able to express our lives , and then they want to spread this information at every time .
this drug was banned in the  UNK  in india in the united states .
because my family didn &apos;t understand the mandarin , so i thought they would be arrested .
so we &apos;re  UNK  , we put a lot of up on it ,  UNK  them up with lenses ,  UNK  them , and then they fold again .
this is the first time in the stage of the ted , so i think you &apos;re very lucky to see this picture .
they vibrate in the big flowers , and those  UNK  in that liquid  UNK  ,  UNK  .
when charles lindbergh over the course of the pacific  UNK  , from the  UNK   UNK  , he saw  UNK  turkish , he said , &quot; these birds don &apos;t know where the first cloned is made out of the .
i had a perfect memory .
the most important people in the  UNK  don &apos;t know if they don &apos;t even go to the public boxes .
&quot; before i die , i want to try . &quot;
because if you have autism , no difference between us -- we have a gift ! who is also one of the gift , and honestly , after the normal is the greatest potential .
because i can see places i &apos;ve been there , where i sleep , night , but i did .
in  UNK  , i was greeted by the women who were used to be sex .
so we &apos;re taught to say , &quot; our tolerance win . &quot;
you want to read the book , let &apos;s read &quot; the aid aid , &quot; written by  UNK   UNK  , an economist .
i grew up there . i raised my sons there .
in fact , a lot of these people would have this kind of  UNK  , infected t.b. and  UNK  in a few years .
because the election didn &apos;t count peace , stability or prestige .
UNK  was attacked by my 68 years .
i was lucky to see a  UNK  suit .
i realized that the problem is the solution .
they showed a  UNK   UNK  from the east to the doors and to the south pole .
he tried to prove everything .
we are soil .
under the taliban , but she had to go to school for hundreds of small people , it was illegal .
thank you very much . thank you .
to change the community , you have to change the base of the soil .
i &apos;m going to skip them , and listen to them . &quot;
yr : don &apos;t say that &apos;s normal .
don &apos;t just say that you can take it down , but let &apos;s go back to the ground down , it &apos;s like the light that we &apos;re going to know to know to know about the cause of bone and how to treat treatment .
i was walking when our boat came to close , to take the boat to cross their little baby .
the school attorney asked me to me , a teaching teaching teaching students for the technical students .
but today , many generations generations are stuck in a lot of generation after that 18 .
we can see them move a lot of different countries , so if you just focus on the scale of the region , which is not going to do anything .
this is me in front of a few days ago .
my question : why am i ?
then , led to volunteer to the  UNK   UNK  , in the last few days .
the journey on the bus is about a week , and there are several times what we &apos;ve been arrested .
well , i couldn &apos;t claim that i had a few moments in my family , but the moments i was like my kids .
so today i &apos;m going to try to explain to explain what i do .
we took a lot of these cubes from this path and we tried them in the lab .
and of course , everything in africa is great .
the family &apos;s heard about this idea .
but the acacia plant themselves into the  UNK   UNK  , and the kids who are  UNK   UNK  .
but what keeps my heart becomes happier and soul , more than that , even though it &apos;s true , even though i don &apos;t think it &apos;s normal , that &apos;s only possible to be able to be that : they are extraordinary -- and that &apos;s extraordinary .
i see these filters centers as well as starbucks .
how did he -- how ? -- &quot; and i said , &quot; i did something very hard .
i tried to  UNK  these lions , and i was standing closer to my father .
my biggest dreams is becoming an airplane engineer and pilot .
look , we have an awful lot of people who are healthy , but when they look closer , there are a lot more difficult to work in an unfavorable situation , there are children .
thank you .
more recently , if you &apos;re watching the news in kenya -- -- these are the characteristics of  UNK  , but i want to leave that .
these pictures have been deserted by her husband who found at a number of  UNK  , and on the long beach from the long faraway place , and they realized him .
you can &apos;t imagine how amazing how wonderful and how they affect people .
there is a problem in the community colleges .
i did work for ngos , and every single project we started in africa .
we need to you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
but lions are smart .
he explained very clear that the feelings of fear is a dangerous danger in this place , not to me , but with them .
i shared it in a  UNK  situation .
hello . i &apos;m ken cameron , and for a short period of time , i &apos;m a one .
back to the  UNK  , i just wanted to cry , but you follow the  UNK  it next to me and said , &quot; oh , don &apos;t do it . right ? &quot;
and we kept on for dinner , but i had to use the whole number of money that i had to pay for the protesters .
max  UNK  : yeah . well , what &apos;s going to happen is , when you have to get your breath .
so today , for me , with me , nothing bad at all .
this is me with the playing field .
and i like , &quot; well , how ? &quot;
i &apos;ve been taking my career working for the u.n. in the united states as nasa and johnson , and  UNK  .
my spirit was always been tempted to be surrounded by the sea slug , covered with  UNK  ,  UNK  and stacks of a hundred years , and i believe in the city that always makes for music .
i was thrown out of that hole , and they were home , but they would never be able to come home , because they were blown away .
in los angeles , people are dying of preventable illness .
he wasn &apos;t going to be able to paint with me , because i was the first woman , and i was the first woman who could fit him in the streets of kabul .
the north korea has discovered the number of money that i sent back to the family , and , to punish them , to steal my family into the countryside .
instead , brennan came home into one night , and he told me that he thought he was thinking about his job , and he said to him , because i made him feel safe and was that he didn &apos;t want to stand up in the wall street and he wanted to walk out of the city , and he wanted to walk out of the city , and he wanted to walk out of the city , and he wanted to walk out of the city , and he wanted to walk out of the city ,
we activate the community .
and every week , we put our  UNK  scan in the library of the backyard , and then you put it in front of the photos to get their photos .
first of all , it &apos;s just like this , i called my wife and she tells me , we talk to each other .
it &apos;s a warm in winter , but summer , it &apos;s hot .
it &apos;s incredible , and we said to the meeting , &quot; people watching the  UNK  to have this form . &quot;
i &apos;ll tell you why .
i thank you with my heart , and i said , &quot; why do you help us ? &quot;
in the himalayas , i found that children have been too many miles across the mountain down the surface .
however , as soon as i had just been living in life , i was told a terrible news .
how do we make this kind of  UNK  , again , like that time ?
i had a chance to go to the first plane for the first time .
can they recover the rest of our information ?
under the weather of the weather , radiation , the  UNK  chemicals , the plastic plastic  UNK  out of this material will be transmitting , and if the engine , it &apos;s going to have a little hump .
it &apos;s like this .
this school in a house , more than 100 percent of us in the living room .
we tend to think about sex slavery when you hear the word , &quot; and because of the collective consciousness , i &apos;m going to be alert to be very difficult to work in this very special industry .
i was involved in the forces in the middle east and out of libya to emulate the snoring of  UNK  and to start a  UNK  against violence .
kenya is going to have a largest field together in africa where the engine will be  UNK  in  UNK  .
if they look tomatoes , they eat .
i mean , ok , why not ?
that means it can be done .
150 years ago , a hundred million dollars a 1.8 percent of the american worker .
now , the last thing i wanted to do was to my new york and my job , but i thought that you had to sacrifice my partner , so i agreed and  UNK  ,  UNK  and i was born in manhattan .
we need to cooperate with government to the level of the region .
like me , they have big dreams .
after two hours of  UNK   UNK  , the koran  UNK  end up in the ground , and in front of us was a deep sea , but they were filled with the  UNK  .
he keeps a tree in our  UNK  our mouths .
you don &apos;t have to design a whole new operating system to make this experiment .
it &apos;s not  UNK  , but there are left with the middle of the white face , to be able to fix it and accurately .
but you have to keep it .
raise it up . it &apos;s a  UNK  cell , blackberry , wow .
all of the things that happened , i &apos;m sure that we &apos;re going to be happy happily because i love him , and he also loved me too much .
when i talk to you today , these guys are still in the middle of them , the lives of living without ambulances or  UNK  , and they will die .
i know that we &apos;re going to dive into personal , but i was a little girl .
together we can make our bed bed , and our family became  UNK  and safe .
that &apos;s my faith , when i talk to people , or from themselves in food .
in november 2011 , watching the world at home , i saw the tragic events in japan .
and he was incredibly  UNK  .
it doesn &apos;t have to go to the clinic to test the  UNK  .
and so i &apos;m also not outraged at all of the driving license minutes to purchase an apple  UNK  .
we are creatures creatures .
the second is that it &apos;s not good at all , i &apos;m not going to wear them .
so i got the  UNK   UNK   UNK  with a teddy  UNK  inside .
i &apos;m going to talk about that .
&quot; when i work , i don &apos;t don &apos;t think about the  UNK  and the stories that are in the photos .
as people , i &apos;m wearing a  UNK   UNK  on the head , it was attached to the old shutter , and i couldn &apos;t be able to look out in the walls of the  UNK  hole in a hundred feet away .
these folks don &apos;t have any  UNK  , when we talk about the difficulty , as a slave of slavery , including slavery slavery , and it was happening in the place where we live .
suddenly , i had no country to be able to be proud of us .
when you see a little bit like this , the first thing that comes out in your head , it &apos;s the real primitive creature , ugly ,  UNK  and eat it .
think about it ?
shortly after that , when i went through a mountain , i saw an odd that i could never forget .
i want to change that perception . i want to change the feelings that you spend for these birds , because they need to our compassion . they &apos;re really needed .
her mother was the  UNK  , and she was a mother to me , and her death was unexpected and unexpected .
until now , i gave them seven to their families in their community , and they work .
i had a little bit scared .
and both of them all . but one of the things , experiment on the  UNK  .
we &apos;re working with local communities .
and yet , he was reminded of freedom to be transported to the support of local activists , like wwf communism , and to be like this , turning up on the face of the  UNK  ,  UNK  me .
thank you very much . bye bye .
in new york , there are only thousands of black people and black people , so for them , the question is not me ? &quot;
i said we &apos;ve created an industrial printer in the lab . so the heat to the hot spots .
eat in the middle of the windows , and where they &apos;re the  UNK  sun .
the testing of neuroscience didn &apos;t have justice . they all use the infrastructure .
to address this problem , we built the materials from the literature .
so we can help support from international aid for training , training english , teaching each other , and many other domains .
first of all you have been kissed , and then , more and more , more , and then -- and then -- -- , i won &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s also a huge difference in your life .
there are no food , there are eating food , because of the surface of the toxic world .
food is the problem and food is also the solution .
i saw a little bit  UNK  .
how do we take our students and want more things that don &apos;t leave the timber of the evil ?
the most important is the aspiration .
this is an installation for the countries like china or iran .
but this is great , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s a very concentric material , if we do the roads like the netherlands , very close with cities , we want a street .
in the first weekend there , i went to to a  UNK  center in town .
thank you .
in fact , hopefully , it doesn &apos;t seem to be like this .
you can imagine , the town has been devastated .
so i set up the light bulbs , you can see them behind you , these are white lions .
it was seven a.m. when i was wearing sleeping .
and in the corner of that dark , i remembered the fear of fear , and that moment , i gained everything in the chaos .
a  UNK   UNK  tells us that more than 27 million people are turned into a prison in the world today .
who is someone who wants to anybody ?
maybe there &apos;s going to be able to figure out who you &apos;ve been involved in this competition , and if you know who knows the leader behind it , it will never be able to happen .
and i decided that i sent out to the supreme court , because i wanted to have these information .
and the reality is that your mind that i don &apos;t fit in the normal society , but you &apos;re often immersed .
when i look at the photos , there were some of a couple of years ago , some of the  UNK  in my room . i thought , was a  UNK  jellyfish that i could take the  UNK  and the red cross , and i know , hundreds of others could do it .
i &apos;d like to introduce you to you .
so , he &apos;s a little bit of an english dictionary , and a dictionary , i told him how many of my family work . there was unlucky , and the guy who went to the  UNK  tea with my family and family two different ways to be born .
the search for finding an entirely new technology has completely gone up all over and all these small factories factories .
they &apos;re also connected to disney --  UNK  and  UNK  ,  UNK  , stupid .
so i had an idea .
and of course , except for surgery , or i was two days ago that i had two days to take pictures , there are very few things that we could do to change their appearance , and look at it , even though it might be thin , and it &apos;s a huge impact on our lives .
so i want to keep on ?
UNK  22 ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
we needed to develop a great  UNK  , but not only  UNK  , but rather than obama , against instead of fighting , against instead of  UNK  .
someone who told me that i was the president of the president , so they were able to test their mandarin  UNK  , and asked me a lot of questions .
the depth of the wall can be there .
if we made these materials , we can find solutions .
and i think this is the reason that &apos;s in the national park in nairobi .
so what did we do ? we &apos;re working on these birds . we &apos;re paving the signals to them .
i &apos;m going to tell you about 10 years of the experience that i &apos;d been doing when i could make it possible , because it doesn &apos;t look like a surgeon surgeon , so you just need a short time .
but the most recent studies have shown in the areas that there are no longer  UNK  about three times four times to  UNK  , and the great effect from this is the spread of disease .
if some women feel frightened when i came up , you &apos;re not saying that i heard today , but then i &apos;ll be too small .
as you see , the lights go out , because that &apos;s where the money is .
and the noise also disappeared .
i realized that my men would love me to kill me if i was him .
i think what they want to hear is , &quot; if you get a little bit , you lose your hair , you &apos;re going to be happy and happier . &quot;
UNK   UNK  : silence .
we didn &apos;t prioritize civil rights .
you know , four taliban came to afghanistan , and i was six years old .
kenya , in this world , it &apos;s a lot more than if there are no great beast .
now i want to introduce you my brother .
where do i come from ? and am i ?
so they &apos;re on the road .
UNK  and living in my own world , with his own , and my father-in-law , and i found the joy of the most people , like the tires around the room and look at the washing machine .
and i began to learn to college .
it &apos;s not true .
enough in the  UNK  million sharks .
what &apos;s your favorite place ?
i used to hate lions , but now because my invention was to save her father and lions , we could live them with lions without any conflict .
after i gave up and coupons , my family was released in a month , and then was arrested again in the
maybe it takes for months .
the time that we spend on each other , is something that we have to embrace and expect for the whole year .
so what do you do -- you lose your mouth .
for the first time i had my apartment apartment , and i had a big secret .
adaptability , you get the oil .
if you tell me that the smart man , the  UNK  , who i was a day , when i was a  UNK  , where i was my wife , i was doing my wife , and i said , who was my friends , and i said , who was my granddad , i was going to leave you at all , because there was no one of the brain or a  UNK  or stressed out at the  UNK  .
i stood on this stage , because i was beautiful , a white woman , and in the background , we call it a  UNK  girl .
and i said , &quot; of course not , i &apos;m not afraid of them .
a lot of them .
&quot; well , why did she stay in iraq ? &quot;
so , in the future , every time you use your cellphone or to remind you that you have to fight for personal health care .
children were taken from the family , the ups and the  UNK  , and was arrested on the boat on this boat , whether they don &apos;t know .
now , it &apos;s not at that point that i realized that these photographs are actually a big part of the big part of these people .
what we have to look at how we &apos;re going to nurture , treatment , education , move and to feed seven billion .
there are two  UNK  on the planet .
when i &apos;m going to show you this talk , i discovered that 98 percent of girls in the united states don &apos;t like my body , and that number up to 78 percent when they were 17 .
but instead , we killed everything we were in .
my city came to me , and i was like to give me a  UNK  , i asked to  UNK  the garden .
she was from the bookshop , and they stopped when she was doing it .
and that &apos;s how the light shines of the black hole when they arrived at night .
&quot; it was amazing to travel , and worked with creative , inspiring inspiration . &quot;
of course , the people who are deeply interested in this work , so we paid them , and sometimes they get them to work .
and the clock is made it off .
after six months of you , the  UNK  volunteers had been involved in  UNK  , and hundreds of people have spent the more  UNK  than the  UNK  , most of the most knowledgeable that he has been with with his parent , this is the most important thing .
it &apos;s a little room in the middle of the ears and the same , which was reviewed by the numbers on the walls , because of the illumination and the  UNK  .
we all know our risk teaching teachers , students and parents .
i discovered that the lions was movement .
the next question i &apos;ve been asked people , &quot; what are you for free ? &quot;
they said , &quot; we don &apos;t have freedom .
it &apos;s around us . we just don &apos;t see .
ah . he &apos;s ready .
over the past four decades , the casa  UNK  of the destruction of the destruction of the infrastructure and infrastructure and culture of ethics .
but most people don &apos;t agree .
i remember once , my mother and my daughter , it was about 10 : 30 and i was in my garden . and then i went out and they were very embarrassed .
who sent the message ?
a new requirement as a family &apos;s office , anesthesiologist family for the job , who you sit in your home , in the coffee shop , and then you find out your resources to turn your own cells into a living way .
they vibrate the bones coming down .
in the past decade decades , we &apos;ve been humbled and not only healthy and the behaviors that we &apos;re programmed to be able to reprogram , but the  UNK  and the  UNK  , and white .
what do you do ? you do ?
the words became more and more like hours after a time , and that &apos;s one of the symptoms of it .
the slave today is serving serving the trade , goods , consumer goods are creating value , but they created themselves .
i don &apos;t like a family  UNK  family .
but let me try .
so right now , you &apos;re reusing at the point without knowing that the most important people in what they want to do with their jobs and their money .
you can see all that .
this paper is a healthy and somebody who are saying , and we can look at ourselves as a  UNK  dancer , because we have to coordinate all of them in the form , and we all have the genes for that .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done here . you see the test we &apos;ve done , and then there &apos;s a lot of the way that will survive in many years without any damage . that &apos;s what we learned from experimentation .
it &apos;s an idea of some people , &quot; this is her fault where the victim dictated the men with his wife .
i live up with this house , and i think how i could do it a beautiful place for my neighborhood , and i also think about something that could change my life forever .
so it &apos;s going to be , if you tell , for example , is that ways to be comfortable and make us excited about things .
in school , we spent a lot of time to learn about the life of the soviet union , but we don &apos;t learn a lot about the outside world , except for the u.s. and japan .
there &apos;s about 10,000 birds in the world .
in fact , they were the first person and a compelling person to the future of their daughters , but in the context of the context like afghanistan , we need to support the support of the men .
if , after an interesting list , they said , &quot; no , no , you know , i want to become a  UNK  , &quot; but i &apos;m going to say &quot;
i have now seen in afghanistan , and this is something that &apos;s often overlooked in the west , which is where the most people into our own lives as babysitters as they are as their own success .
because in south korea , english is critical , so i began to learn english , my third language .
in that , we followed the  UNK   UNK  , and then about a half hours in the woods , the birds have gone in the water after the rains , so i took the camera on the back of the front of her chest .
there &apos;s about  UNK  information .
this is where you &apos;re sitting in the  UNK  , the cars have gone up , and the great news is , when you and i sat in this talk , you &apos;ve been reunited with family family , and let &apos;s family , the family was given the tools to make a living room and keep in the safe .
look for her book .
the west has suffered over the gap that are almost impossible to be free .
i was incredibly lucky to get a lot of help , and i was inspired by my life , so i wanted to be able to help them to bring back to the country to an opportunity to develop with the support of the international support .
other other things like that are being  UNK  , even after the  UNK  of the financial sources , and the movement of the auto system to make trauma victims and children whose children , these children are often overlooked by the  UNK  of the boat who were beaten to their men .
anyone who are or or parkinson &apos;s heart disease can remind me with a cheap , and then  UNK  the paper , a few times every time , and i &apos;m really excited to report that we &apos;ve reached six percent of only hours .
i &apos;m only 22 years old , living in the united states , women are 16 years old lady who &apos;s three times higher than the children &apos;s maternal health clinic , but on the age of women , and on women who are killed every year by suicide bombers , and the  UNK  in the u.s.
the hope is less than an image in the middle .
the engineers i work also taught me to learn to  UNK  things , and i wanted to summarize with a equation .
more than 70 percent of the defeated rate , after all the time when the victim was , when she left , because then the warranty has nothing .
you should look at the crap -- -- you should look at the crap that we &apos;ve given africans african people .
even during the egg and find a job , their life could be completely immersed in a different way .
and this is how i in the land .
the second important things we have is time and relationships with others .
because there &apos;s no power , you can be the editor of the  UNK  sitcom in the u.s. or the  UNK  of m &amp; amp ; m &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em
