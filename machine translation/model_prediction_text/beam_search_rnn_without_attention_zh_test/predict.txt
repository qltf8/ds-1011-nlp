hello . hello . hello , i &apos;m going to show you a video of video clips , and i &apos;m showing you a video video of youtube video .
this is true .
so what we &apos;re going to do today is going to be important
we &apos;re all aware of all , when a young musician -- and i &apos;m very , very , very , .
now , this may be a lot of fun to talk about what &apos;s happening to do , and to talk about what &apos;s happening to do , to talk about what &apos;s happening in the world , and to make sure that we can do .
many of you are online in the web .
but it turns out there &apos;s several hours of youtube videos .
in fact , in many cases , it turns out a lot of people , and in fact , it &apos;s a precondition .
so how do you do that ?
audience : there &apos;s a community community , and
okay , let &apos;s look at .
john  UNK  : oh my god , oh my god , my god , my god . oh my god .
oh , my god !
UNK  !
oh , oh !
last year , ladies and gentlemen , there was only one of the footage of the  UNK  of the
in 2010 , it &apos;s been recorded for thousands of years .
and this picture shows this graph showing this video of what happened .
but it didn &apos;t want to do that video .
he just wanted to share .
because this is what happens when you &apos;re going to do .
he &apos;s got a lot of videos videos .
this video is actually last summer .
so what happened ?
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
jimmy wales  UNK  : a video camera
now , for example , margaret thatcher is amazing , that &apos;s something that &apos;s really exciting for us to learn to listen to music .
UNK  : 15 minutes : 15 years old , and every couple of days later , you know , there will be a couple of years ago , and when you &apos;re going to talk about , you
jenny is  UNK   UNK  : one of the founders of new york .
this year , of course , it &apos;s going to .
this graph shows the trend .
i don &apos;t want to know from the  UNK   UNK  , which is the middle passage , which i read .
what happened ?
oh , that day , a day , day .
and if you were lucky , you know , when you were young .
but what happened in this day , what happened ?
so it &apos;s  UNK  , and it &apos;s  UNK  , and it &apos;s a lot of
it was the director of the theater of thomas jefferson , and he said , he did the science behind music .
and then there &apos;s a group of video that they &apos;re looking at all sorts of their friends , and then they &apos;d like to show you a video of video .
and this would be a shared identity , and it would be very difficult to share with it , and it would not just end up with it .
so now , there &apos;s a number of encyclopedias on the internet .
and it &apos;s almost entirely different concerts .
unlike the landscape of the media landscape , it was an art installation -- and it became a media landscape , it was an organization called  UNK  innovation .
so this is just a  UNK  of a  UNK   UNK  .
so this is what it looks like .
and this year , this year , the  UNK  of the
and if you think about this , you can imagine that it &apos;s a video game than that , and that &apos;s a lot of video games .
even a video of the video games .
the cat is looking at cat cat .
but the most important thing about this is the core of technology , the technology .
and you get a  UNK  .
it &apos;s got a  UNK  .
and then go to the airport .
the whole thing about this is a  UNK  artist , and this is that you can make a  UNK  . .
because now we &apos;re not alone , but we &apos;re not alone .
who knows this ?
can you have  UNK  or  UNK   UNK  , or &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  ? &quot;
what would you write in your writing ?
at this time , it &apos;s just one of the most common video games , and the only three minutes of all the time , the
a friend of mine was looking at the south bronx from the south bronx , and i decided to show that there was a lot more interested in new york city .
mike degruy : because i had a lot of a lot because i didn &apos;t get a lot because it was because you couldn &apos;t see it because there was a lot of
kevin bales : this idea of a  UNK  of a  UNK  of a
and this is what we &apos;re looking at .
so let &apos;s do this question ...
sir john  UNK  : what do you do ?
oh ...
kevin : what is this ?
it turns out to be a new way of empowerment and empowerment and empowerment , and it turns out that this is the best way to communicate with each other .
and as i do , as i speak , i posted portraits on the street .
you don &apos;t need excuses .
it &apos;s in the culture of culture that we are .
but it &apos;s not the media and the media , and it &apos;s not the , , , , ,
thank you .
10 years ago , i &apos;ve been talking about 10 years old , five years ago , and on the left side of the day of the 21st century , on the left side of the 21st century , on the left side of the 21st century , and that &apos;s been a
a story short story .
it &apos;s like a  UNK  .
please allow me to show you .
the first one in the gang , was a  UNK  job .
he was one of the president of  UNK  life , and a
imagine trying to imagine being an atheist in his life .
and a friend of mine .
he &apos;s going to silence .
history , as he died .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i don &apos;t know anything about his life .
but our life more often than our bodies .
my grandfather had brought me to his life .
and my responsibility is to accept my father , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to focus on is that we &apos;re trying to get rid of what &apos;s going to happen is that we &apos;re trying to know , and we &apos;re
the next one morning is the mountain on the mountain .
my mother , 18 years old , and my grandmother has been two years old , and i have two years old .
and the only way to survive , it was the only life that she lived in life .
that &apos;s her , that &apos;s her .
and so , in the next four years , the story of years , the , , the the
and of course , they know that they are dangerous .
the biggest threat is about death and death .
and like all , i was a mother , and i my mother .
if we were born , mom and sisters , my mom , my mom , my mom , my mom , my mother , my mother , my mother &apos;s mother .
the first one i learned from the first one of my first life from the back of the spinal cord was  UNK  .
i didn &apos;t know about it , and when i went out there , and i went out of the men and the men who didn &apos;t stop .
but i remember when the soviet union comes from the soviet union , and the soviet union comes from the soviet union , and the first person from the south pole was the first person from the south pole .
they didn &apos;t eat the fish .
and within three months later , we were born in a refugee camp .
the next one is the next generation of creating a new set of life .
in north carolina , one of the oil spill .
even though it doesn &apos;t matter , it &apos;s the opposite of my hometown , and the more i &apos;ve ever done .
on the other side of the other side of the other side .
and that &apos;s the same thing : the same thing , the same , the same
a week later , a week after a week , a week later , the  UNK  , the
sometimes she used to learn english and learn english language .
we are .
every four hours of  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,
the next time , the  UNK  ,
the school fell in england , because it was six years old .
even though it &apos;s a little bit like  UNK  , but who said , &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  , &quot;
what about home ?
something else happened to me .
it &apos;s been quiet for me , and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;m going to immerse you . &quot;
i married my sister and i slept with my mother .
each of every day of the day of the day of the day , our smile , our own home , but we
my mother was born with all the time .
and my job is my job when she &apos;s doing her job .
she came up with a computer , and she was learning a computer .
the stories of the story of the story of the world , , , , , .
funding and funding .
the center center .
i live in a living world .
on the third side , i think , one of the biggest things that you see is true .
on the other hand , i think , on the level of violence , amphibians , violence and violence .
but that &apos;s a lot of help .
when i was when i was a teenager , i decided to become a  UNK  .
i just came up with a piece of paper , and there &apos;s another one .
it was a member of  UNK  , a filmmaker , a filmmaker , an activist , an activist , an activist , an activist activist , where you can &apos;t even imagine .
i don &apos;t know .
we don &apos;t know how to use .
i &apos;m not talking about it .
no .
i &apos;d like to live with the rest of my life in the last 20 years of life , and the rest of the world -- two and the rest of the world , the
i told her , i couldn &apos;t do that .
and she reminded me when she came up with me , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing now .
no choice .
&quot; ma &apos;am , she said , &quot; she said . &quot;
and so i talked about the importance of the conversation , and i talked about the federal government .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit more about me .
and people , what people do , what they do , what their lives do .
and even though i realized that i wasn &apos;t enough , i couldn &apos;t rely on the law .
here &apos;s another one .
and so what i &apos;ve been doing is not only recently in the last couple of years , even though , not just the last few years ,
because , as easy as easy as easy as easy as easy as easy as easy as easy as easy as easy as possible .
i &apos;m trying to stand up in the middle of nowhere , and i &apos;m trying to stand up there , is not enough .
you don &apos;t want to be a , or a
and here , there &apos;s a little bit of optimism and optimism and optimism .
overcome my eyes .
i got a group called  UNK  , which is the only way we could .
a year ago , we &apos;re not alone .
and every day i &apos;ve done every day , i &apos;m going to
every hours of work works .
most of us are crazy , crazy , crazy , crazy .
and i thought it was in the u.s.
a trip .
and i accepted my success .
i get three months later , three months .
at the end of the end of my grandmother .
she grew up in the rift valley , and this is the largest
a few centuries will change his life .
when her father died , her father died .
it was a mother by the mother .
she was nine years old , and she was  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
without husband , husband &apos;s husband &apos;s husband &apos;s husband , his husband , his husband , his husband , his husband .
it could be impossible .
when she died in prison , there was 600 miles away from wormwood scrubs .
as i looked at the sky , i was looking at the sky .
i know she was singing .
my mother rang my mother .
after a few days later , we sat there , and she sat down there .
we told her story telling her story .
and ken robinson tells us that he had to be  UNK  .
my mother said , &quot; mom &apos;s eyes .
and she asked her , &quot; why , &quot; why would it be great ? &quot;
&quot; because what you want to see is coming back , he said , &quot; he said .
&quot; you &apos;ve never heard before . &quot;
if we have women in the way , it &apos;s
and with the idea that we have to do this , we , we , we , we , we , we , we to , we to , we to , we to . . we
it &apos;s easy to failure .
now i want to myself my own myself .
who else would not do that ?
but i feared the fear of fear and anxiety .
and they make sense of all of their lives ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , , ,
i don &apos;t know .
but i can look at it , and that &apos;s where i can see it , and it &apos;s
and at the same time , of course , today ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
i &apos;d like to share with you today .
or , what about it ?
because of course , this is a picture , but you don &apos;t .
and yet , when i was 15 years old , when i was 15 years old , i was 15 years old .
i had this whole raft of encyclopedias , because there was a lot of there , but there was a whole heap of there .
and when you arrive at the end of the process , you get the back of the back of the
so it &apos;s been fascinated by looking at photography and photography .
i think anyone can do it .
so what i &apos;d like to do is the only way that the only way the entire process is that when you get a whole process of the whole process .
here &apos;s an example of an area of an area where you can &apos;t see an area .
but compassion .
still it still has a serious issue .
and it &apos;s a little bit like a piece that has been  UNK  , but it &apos;s
what i &apos;m talking about is a photograph .
because it doesn &apos;t matter what it looks like , but if you can look at it , you can see what it looks like , but you can look at it .
it takes a lot of you need to look at these pictures .
so what &apos;s really more is that this is not a real challenge .
but what does it look like to look at these pictures ?
is it about ? or is it about ?
or is it about it ?
what is this happening ?
and sometimes it &apos;s different .
but ultimately , ultimately , how do we want to understand how this is happening , and how we can understand the universe
it &apos;s not what it looks like , but what we think about what we think about .
so i think these are very simple .
i mean , it &apos;s one of the world to create a reality that &apos;s reality in reality , and that &apos;s reality to create a real world .
let me give you a simple example .
there are three dimensions in the real world ; it &apos;s a real world that we can .
but it would be kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of sort of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of object ,
but we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s possible .
and that &apos;s because we &apos;ve actually put it in the face of the brain .
and this is a picture .
it &apos;s just different reality .
so it looks like something that looks like a lot of things that we don &apos;t want to see .
but when you think about a tenth of a hundred years , we think about it .
and what i want to say is that we want to make three simple rules .
you see , these are not special .
but together , you can create them together .
so the first one is that all of all of the other elements of
second , the fact that you have the same
these are the same ones that are identical to the same same as the same same as the same size .
and the third thing is to show you a little bit more different than the
and it gives us a sense of how it works .
and by looking at the surface of a different angle , a picture of a square kilometer , a picture of looking at the image of a square kilometer , and this is a picture of a picture of looking at the image that you can see on the other side of the image that you can see on the other side of the image , and this is a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture like this .
here &apos;s another example .
some of you may have thought that this is a  UNK  device .
but this photograph was taken by a picture of different pictures .
and i find myself a place where i think , because some of you can find yourself in a place where you can &apos;t find yourself .
but it takes a lot of needed .
and the last year after this year , i noticed that there was a couple of months ago , and when i was looking for a few months ago , it would have changed the whole series of months .
for example , this is a  UNK   UNK  .
the australian museum is another one .
and this is a map of the
well , it took me up to my house , and i was able to go into the sahara .
and in order to think about that , i think the most important thing is .
well , there &apos;s a whole idea of ideas and ideas .
and then these pictures are different .
so here &apos;s a video camera .
and if you can look at this picture , it &apos;s pretty cool .
so all of all that is the only way of our imagination .
thank you .
so i want to talk to you about the reason why we &apos;re going
and the most important thing i want to remember is that we don &apos;t have patients .
one of the things that we did in the university of chicago is a  UNK  , and the
it &apos;s not a good thing -- whether it &apos;s a coffee or a coffee , or  UNK  , or  UNK  , or , , , , ?
what do we need help ? &quot;
i think we thought that one of the things that we think is that the fact that this is one of the reasons why we don &apos;t care about anything else .
this is my wife , and it &apos;s a very simple one .
there &apos;s a switch .
i woke up every morning .
i &apos;m sorry , so i &apos;m going to show you what you can see .
i &apos;m  UNK  the weight .
and it turns out that it &apos;s very hard for me , and in fact , it &apos;s going to
at the same time i look at the same weight of my car , i look at what &apos;s going on , but look at the same time , look at the same time , and look at the same time , look at the same time , and look at the same time , and look at the same time , and look at the same time .
but there &apos;s something else .
some of you may know , i think , well , i &apos;m going to be a
so every morning i used to wake up in front of the morning , and i woke up every day , and i want to hear you know what i want to say , &quot; wow , i want to talk to you today . &quot;
but it turns out that this is a precondition , because it helps help the help of the help of treatment , and it helps help save the help of the heart of treatment .
but on the other side , there &apos;s a group of people working together , and to engage with a better health crisis .
the next week is this week .
at the same time , there would be a smartphone with a smartphone .
and then people came back and forth , and then they send money to pay attention to their data , and then they send money to the caregiver .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s really important is that the data can &apos;t help , whether it frees , whether we train them to help them , whether we train them to help them , whether we train them to help them , whether it &apos;s a health care or health care .
we need to make sure that we need to allow ourselves to allow us to get rid of the patient .
and you can adjust this technology , and you can put a lot of the
so today i &apos;m going to show you a project that we &apos;re going to do
we have scissors devices .
it &apos;s even more mobile phones .
we know how to get rid of the
you know , there &apos;s all kinds of water .
and of course , of course , of course .
but what can happen in the last 20 years of our patients ?
we were there , we don &apos;t know .
nobody knows what can be able to find out of the millions of thousands and thousands of thousands of people .
and we &apos;re going to get the to the to the the to the the
we &apos;re going to build a website online , and if you want to go online , it &apos;s online , and if you want to look at the center of the site , it &apos;s open to the center of the site , and it &apos;s open to the site , and it &apos;s open to the center of the site .
the netherlands has been  UNK  in  UNK  .
the next step is the next step .
we developed a smartphone app .
you know ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
and if you can raise your smartphone , you can get 60 years to save a mobile phone and save lives .
i &apos;m going to show you today , not just the name of the name of  UNK  .
we &apos;re going to build this project .
we &apos;ve been working together with colleagues , and we &apos;ve been working together thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of people around the world around the world .
so if you look at this map , you find it , or you can find somebody who is , or even if you &apos;re a
we &apos;re going to do this in a world where we want to make a difference .
maybe for example , if you can look at the red line , and you can see whether it &apos;s been there .
so please help us do this in the future , but we can &apos;t help .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about some of that .
now i &apos;m working on solar panels .
i &apos;ve been working with a lot of companies working on this kind of work on the scale of what we &apos;re doing .
focus on the road .
that &apos;s what happens to show us what we do .
ah , wait .
so here &apos;s the video games .
maybe we can -- i &apos;ll show you .
no .
that &apos;s not .
all right .
solar technology ...
no , i &apos;ve lost time to time .
well , thank you very much .
a few years ago , a couple of years ago , i decided to design a little bit of a -- and a a a a a -- a , a a
this is a project called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is a  UNK  .
we &apos;re going to work for a year , and a few people to work their jobs .
it &apos;s not going to save them , but they will bring them into the world .
and at that time , they create a better job .
but what really matters is that these technologies are capable of possibilities .
it &apos;s  UNK  .
al gore is a  UNK  .
it seems that it looks like a horse , but it &apos;s going to be it , but it it , because it it , it it , it it , it it , it it , it that , it that , it , it , it that , it it , it , it it , it , it , it it , it , it , it it , it , it , it it , it , it it , it , it it , it , it , it it , it it ,
how does this help create a way of a way to help people ?
last year , we &apos;ve been working on the u.s.
when they were finished , when they finished , there was a lot of last year .
and they noticed that there was a very large part of the city .
and the other side of the team came up with a team called  UNK  , and then the experimenter was going to go into the park .
so he made a difference in his career , and he did anything .
so this is a  UNK  program that allows you to search for a program .
and then you get a little bit of it , and
and if you can do this , you can name the name .
but if you don &apos;t get it , you can go to it .
so , there are some of these kinds of legos .
so this is a small program .
it turns out that it was a graduate student in the kitchen .
but it doesn &apos;t do anything to do anything else .
it &apos;s like a virus .
this is an architect in the courtyard of wisconsin , and it tries to sell it , and it tries to sell it , and it tries to sell it , and it tries to sell it , and it tries to sell it to it .
it &apos;s very important , but it &apos;s an important , but it &apos;s
so he &apos;s asking them to go to them .
and then it took me out of the water , and then put it back into the city .
the chicago started to go to park , and then it &apos;s going to
we know that there are three billion , we know it .
it &apos;s organic , organic , organic .
and if you &apos;re familiar with technology , you don &apos;t know what happens .
software is a software that requires a few years .
last year , we hosted two months ago , and a half months ago , two dollars a team .
it helps kids to help their parents &apos; children .
and so , we &apos;ve done that for a long time , two years , the next five years , the next five years , the next two years .
and this is a small number .
a hundred billion dollars a year ago , a million dollars a year , but it &apos;s not a
and every single one of these projects are different .
so a few months later , a few days later , a few days later , a few years later , a lot of government .
and it turned out to be more difficult , but it &apos;s like a lot more like a lot of people , but , like , , , , , , it , like a lot of .
even more than a technology , it &apos;s like a company .
and it means that it &apos;s encrypted , it &apos;s encrypted .
it &apos;s very important .
but it &apos;s also the most important part of the , of the , of the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the . .
and this is really exciting , because it &apos;s very exciting for us , very , very , very , very well .
now , there &apos;s a great tool that we can make a better place to make better decisions .
it &apos;s not only one of the kids in the united states , and in the community &apos;s own community .
they don &apos;t have government government .
and they were very disappointed , and they didn &apos;t commit , but they weren &apos;t .
these guys have lost some of us .
and that &apos;s what happens when you look at , when you look at the united states , our government and our government and our government and our government and our government and our government and our government , and we said , &quot; well , we can &apos;t fix our government . &quot;
now there are many of the people who are now
and if you are a lot of them , i think , because you can change them .
political reforms are changing , but the government is changing .
and since the future , because of course , it will change the value of how we change it .
and when i began to realize that i didn &apos;t know what i did .
as many people say , i think it &apos;s a government to work .
two years later , i came up with the government of government , and that &apos;s the government .
this is the phone website and the phone calls .
if you &apos;re born in your city , you will , you will .
if you have an opportunity in the center of chicago , you have the same job -- and then you have the same thing -- that &apos;s what you do in the center of all kinds of projects -- and then you get the same kinds of projects that we &apos;ve done in the same way -- and that &apos;s what you have to do is to do that .
and maitreya came up with this guy .
he wrote the &quot; button &quot; button . &quot;
nothing has happened .
and then finally , he says , &quot; okay , you can put it up , and i &apos;m going to pick it up , and i &apos;m going to pick it up , and then i &apos;m going to pick it up and then i &apos;m going to come up with it ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened .
but this is not a story .
there &apos;s no central center .
it &apos;s a program , and it &apos;s called a website called the website .
we don &apos;t have this program .
it was a new group of a smart city group of smart people in the city .
and one of the things that came out there was a letter that was published in the united states , and it said that there was an error , and it didn &apos;t matter if it was killed .
how am i going to put it back ? &quot;
willful blindness has a different approach .
the human mind is that people .
but what it does is that every person in the street , it &apos;s possible .
once again , one of the neighbors .
and we said , &quot; you know , i wrote a book , &quot; i &apos;m going to get the
okay ? yes . yeah .
go back home and go back home .
wait for a long time . &quot;
that &apos;s simple .
so that &apos;s great . that &apos;s the world .
and this is a good example of a good example of good ideas .
but this is also an example of a government funded by the government .
and in this case , i &apos;m not talking about technology
i just wanted to give you a goal .
a citizen is a role in a role in a role .
it will two together .
it could provide a public service , and it provides a lot of money and a service and a government service .
when it comes to a social network , it will help us .
we call it a lot of money , and we
and one of the important things that we need to think about politics is not really important .
a lot of people who believe that politics is , but they don &apos;t know what the government is .
we &apos;re asking the system for the first time of the system .
at the end of our discussion , we talk about what &apos;s happened when we &apos;re dealing with our political leaders , and what &apos;s happened in the united states , we need political leaders that we need political leaders , and what &apos;s happened to happen , and what &apos;s going to happen ?
and the reason it is because there &apos;s a huge amount of political system .
and this is what we &apos;re looking at .
and we &apos;re talking about the word word advisedly .
but this is the kind of thing that makes us our strength for ourselves , and that is our ability to get rid of our capacity for us to lose our energy , our energy consumption , our ability to save our lives .
people seem to think about politics .
and if we want to make it happen , we want to make it to become a  UNK  service .
because what happened is there .
we have to get government systems .
and this is what happened in the u.s.
have you ever seen this ?
they were a group of a group called  UNK   UNK  , which was a series of  UNK  legislation in the united states .
it &apos;s not about politics , but it &apos;s political .
now , now , the reason we &apos;re trying to ask ourselves is that our children , our children , our children , our grandchildren , our children .
and you have to realize that the challenge is challenging to challenge .
and in this case , we don &apos;t depend on the road , we want to do that , we want to do that we
we don &apos;t need to be more effective , and we need more .
the good news is that this process is that we use this process , but it &apos;s our ability to build our institutions and our institutions to do that .
now most of the people in the business business system , they don &apos;t need to know what they &apos;re doing .
our younger generation was younger , and they were younger , and they were younger , so they were younger .
and that generation grew up in their own lives .
they don &apos;t have to have their own enemies , and we need them to be .
they can do anything they can do anything they can do anything they can do .
so when they get sick , they don &apos;t care about their opinions .
they can use their hands .
and they were able to use their customers to work with their customers .
and these programs are using our social identities .
it would be  UNK  , and it would be a  UNK   UNK  , or a halt .
and of course , of course , many of people began to get started .
but of course , it &apos;s just as much as we can use , but we don &apos;t just need to know that the government is not only the government , but also for the first time .
and we &apos;re not alone , but we are .
and before that , we need to pay attention to the government .
so here &apos;s one of the big questions that we need to think about : when we start with a group of people , and we &apos;re asking ourselves , and when we think about ourselves , we need to think about something that we can do when we think , are we going to do something , when we are , we
thank you .
and since i &apos;m going to try and talk to what i &apos;m going to try and talk about what i &apos;m going to try and talk about this technology , i don &apos;t think of what this technology is going to look at this technology , which i think is what &apos;s going to happen if i don &apos;t know what technology is going to happen , which i think is what &apos;s going to happen . i think , is what i &apos;m going to do , . i
let me start with this slide slide .
and then you can get the slide .
it &apos;s just my vocation from a random jumble .
what i &apos;m going to show you about is it &apos;s not a , but
and this is what we &apos;re doing , and the the the the the  UNK  the the
what &apos;s interesting is interesting about the slide , we &apos;re just one of our favorite slide in the slide .
so that &apos;s the size of the size of the rectangle .
there &apos;s a new requirement for a second , and it &apos;s not really exciting .
and that &apos;s a little bit .
that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to do .
the next line .
i &apos;m going to put a slide on this slide , because i &apos;m going
why are we going to look at this technology ?
well , the answer is , if we &apos;ve done this , that &apos;s a long time ago , which is a kind of thing that i &apos;ve been looking at , which is a kind of thing that is , and this is the kind of thing that i &apos;ve been looking at this time , which is a kind of a kind of  UNK  device .
a little bit like this .
and it doesn &apos;t work .
now , if you look at this case , it &apos;s kind of like , if you compare it , it &apos;s kind of like  UNK  , the  UNK  , the .
but if this happens is something like this .
and if technology is technology , i &apos;m going to go back to 30 seconds , and then i &apos;ve got 30 seconds after 30 seconds , i &apos;ve got 30 seconds .
but it doesn &apos;t make it faster .
there &apos;s a technology that has happened in the history of millions of years , even more than that .
now what i want to show you is that this is not going to happen if it doesn &apos;t happen .
it &apos;s going to happen fast .
the two things happen .
either you can turn it into something like this , or something like this , or something like this .
that &apos;s all possible .
now i &apos;m a nerd , so i &apos;m going to do it , so i think it &apos;s possible to do it .
and if that means that means we &apos;re going to be
we &apos;re seeing in the past few years from the past .
so i &apos;m asking myself , and i &apos;m asking myself , and i &apos;m asking myself , what is the future ?
what &apos;s the new age of ?
and it &apos;s very important because when it comes to us , it &apos;s very clear .
well , when i was growing up in 2000 , i would say , what would happen next year , what would happen next year .
now , in this room , you &apos;re going to come up with this future , and you see the future , or the future .
that &apos;s what we can do .
in other words , i would argue that in my life expectancy .
and the reason i think is because we feel what we feel .
change is happening . we can .
we know that there are four billion different countries that are going to be completely different , because they don &apos;t have a long time .
so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s going to happen , and what &apos;s going on .
for a long time , i &apos;d like to introduce you to build a computer , but they &apos;re not
because the only way i decided to do this is the only way to go to the city .
and what i &apos;m going to show you is that the planet is living on earth .
and i think that if you think about it every time you get a little bit of , you
so if you &apos;re about 25 billion years ago , it &apos;s about 25 billion tons of water , so that &apos;s a huge amount of water .
and if you look at how we can figure out how to do it ?
and i want to explain to think about this , but i think , is something that you &apos;re in , life , a , a , a , ,
some protocells have a lot of chemical elements , and it &apos;s going to produce chemical structures , and it &apos;s going to
it &apos;s kind of like crazy .
and the most amazing thing that happens is , in fact , these cells are .
but now , this is not happening because we &apos;re here today , because every single one of these are .
every single moment , every single one of the planet is not .
so every color is different .
and in fact , what they do is to make more different places that are  UNK  , more , more , more , more , more , more .
so they &apos;re getting faster and faster .
it &apos;s a very simple form of encyclopedias , but it turns out that it &apos;s a very interesting process of life .
somehow we don &apos;t know how to do it , and it &apos;s
they learn to learn from a very special substance called  UNK  .
and so , in this case , this is a way that they &apos;re stored in a way that way , in a way , in a way , in a way , in the way , ,
and what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s 25 years ago , because it &apos;s 25 years old .
in fact , what we &apos;re doing is the same genetic code , the same genetic code .
in fact , there are all sorts of letters and the same genetic code .
in fact , what i &apos;ve done is , what i &apos;ve done is , what we do is to do is reorder the information that we can do .
and i had this data set up to the airport , and i &apos;ve never seen them .
so what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to do it , and i it , and i , i i i i i i i i i i &apos;m going to have a a card card , and ,
so if every one of those five people in this room , i would say that every one of these things , and i &apos;m going to do it for me .
if i was a person in a room , i found myself in the room .
so what &apos;s next ?
it &apos;s about 20 pages of interesting things .
and it creates a very important part of the parts of the cell .
but there &apos;s another interesting thing that starts with each other , and then they start interacting with cells , and they start interacting with each other .
i don &apos;t know if you know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
that &apos;s why this is what happens .
so some bacteria have to think about bacteria , because it &apos;s bacteria , and it &apos;s bacteria that bacteria bacteria , and then it &apos;s bacteria that bacteria bacteria .
so , these forms of these objects , they form a kind of  UNK  , and they are .
and so if they put together , they get more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more and more .
and so , when it turns out , they start to find a group of people who are , and they &apos;re in , they &apos;re in the
the next part of the next stage in the next stage .
and in this case , there &apos;s a lot of different types of cells , and there &apos;s a lot of different kinds of cells that are growing .
in fact , we actually have more cells .
we don &apos;t have a lot of them , not for themselves .
the skin muscle cells , muscle cells , muscle cells , muscle cells , and so forth .
so these organisms have evolved in the evolution of these extinct species , and that &apos;s because of the genes that we are .
what happens next is happening in these places .
these cells are going to come out , and they &apos;re going to .
they start to build a very complex structure .
these are the patterns .
so the neurons are interacting with cells .
in fact , in the course of the , the , the , the , ,
so these are the protocells of the brain cells .
this gives them evolved .
because each of us , each individual has a mutation , not as individuals in the process .
so for a reason for a reason , it &apos;s like to eat , because it doesn &apos;t like to eat , but it &apos;s not a fluke .
it could have happened in this century , and it would have happened , and then , in fact , was able to learn how to make it happen by a  UNK  , a  UNK  , a ,
so , the nervous system has evolved to evolve very quickly .
because there is something that happens .
it &apos;s going to happen .
but then what happens is , what everyone is happening is , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course .
so , for example , what we know is that the human language is the language of human language .
think that &apos;s a wonderful invention .
and i had an idea of a crazy idea .
and i &apos;m sitting there , and i &apos;m sitting there , and this is a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind
but we &apos;re getting smart and complex things that are very complex , and the more complex things that are .
so now this is really what we &apos;re doing now as a model .
so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve been doing , we &apos;ve been .
what we &apos;re seeing in the same way we &apos;re seeing in the way we &apos;re going , , , ,
for example , for example , this is a very small concept .
computer , on the internet , we all know , are the ones that are  UNK  , and we &apos;re in the
these are all these technologies that we &apos;ve been doing , faster , faster , faster , faster .
so , evolution has evolved to happen .
now , you &apos;ve seen some of the evolution of this little bit of the evolution of evolution that you see here -- that evolution has evolved evolved by evolution .
so now we &apos;re getting closer again .
and one of the projects that i &apos;ve been working on for the next 15 years .
the next step , the brain is like a nervous system .
and then , again , we need to get rid of poverty , and we need to wait .
like , on the side , it &apos;s going to happen .
and the process is becoming slow , and i think , it &apos;s a process that i process -- it &apos;s a process that i process .
more change , the more changes .
this is what i think we &apos;re seeing here is the way we see here .
we saw this process of seeing this process .
i work with my computer program , computer programs , and i don &apos;t know if i don &apos;t have computers , i don &apos;t know how to do .
now , what i &apos;m doing is that design is not possible to design .
i don &apos;t know how to connect with machines .
there are thousands of trees .
what i did , what he did was doing , i think , what i did was doing was doing some of the things that we did , and we thought to do something more complicated , so that we could make it better than we do .
in fact , sometimes we don &apos;t understand it .
now , one of the most interesting things that i &apos;ve been thinking about is that this is .
so what we do is doing this in this machine , in this case , it &apos;s going to happen .
for example , in fact , in fact , in fact , by testing , we can actually start with the monkeys .
and the experimenter says , you can click on a computer .
now , all of all of this works is that you &apos;re going to do all of all the machines that you want to do , all of all the machines that are going to do with all the machines . &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
and i suppose that i &apos;m going to use a different application , and this is a simple answer .
find find the best way to find myself .
and of course , it doesn &apos;t matter if any of them could do it , so they can &apos;t do anything .
but there &apos;s one thing , though , there &apos;s a number two , and it &apos;s going to be .
i said , &quot; please , you &apos;ve got the best computers in the computer .
it &apos;s all over the same time .
now , the best way to do this .
and in the process , you know , they &apos;re .
and two of them are two two teas that are two two teas that are the two requirements of these two teas that are the two requirements of these two teas .
so i &apos;ve been working with a number of startups that are made by a number of  UNK  .
say , &quot; let &apos;s look at this process . &quot;
again .
maybe some of you might be .
it &apos;s going to be in new orleans .
and this takes a couple of thousand pounds .
so i &apos;ve been doing this for a couple of years , for a few minutes , a few minutes , a few years , and
at the end of the end , i ended up with it .
in fact , these words are much more relevant than me .
now , if i don &apos;t know how to do it , they work .
i tried to explain how it works .
they &apos;re very strange .
but they can do it .
in fact , i know , i can tell them , because they come from , they can do it , and they
in fact , they live in life .
i had a time to go up and see him , and he said , &quot; look at this . &quot;
and it &apos;s been said , &quot; well , there &apos;s a lot of jobs that are safe for you ? &quot;
in fact , we know that a lot of work works .
and so we started making a computer program .
it allows us to produce more efficient and more complex things .
however , we don &apos;t even know .
it &apos;s a little bit better than us .
so what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re going to run faster and faster than we &apos;re going to do that .
so it &apos;s about itself .
it became a bit faster , so i was so excited to understand why i was so nervous .
because of all of all of these technologies are available .
we &apos;re working on .
what we &apos;re looking at is one of the neurons that we &apos;re looking at cells , more and more neurons .
we &apos;re looking for ourselves .
we &apos;re looking at .
but i think there &apos;s something that we have .
and i think that &apos;s what we think , is the evolution of evolution .
and i think that all of us is going to be part of what it is .
and i was very superstitious , and i thought i &apos;d been there , and i thought i &apos;d be there , and i &apos;m here .
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
i was in my 20s , when i was in prison .
most of the time i spend a lot of time traveling around the world .
you &apos;re going to see this ted talk about the ted audience today .
and in this time , i noticed that i noticed that there &apos;s a
what you can see is happening .
and what happens when you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s much more important than ted .
and i think this is because i think that &apos;s really important .
we &apos;ve heard about some  UNK  .
we &apos;ve also learned that as a teacher teacher is a teacher teacher , you know , if you &apos;re a teacher teacher , it &apos;s a teacher teacher .
so as a physician , you can help doctors , you can help doctors , doctors can help you help doctors .
so i want to talk about the importance .
i &apos;m not going to talk about how to do something about how to do something different from other parts .
i actually learned it from my grandmother .
my family was my family in my family in my family .
she was very quiet , and she was quiet .
there &apos;s home , and there &apos;s a little girl .
but there &apos;s a lot of her .
her parents were  UNK  .
in the 1970s , she was  UNK  by her parents .
i &apos;d like to show my parents in the early &apos; 80s in the early days of the world .
my grandmother was mesmerized , but she was conflicted .
and when i was a woman , she wanted her mother .
she has to work with her eyes , and then she &apos;s going to come back to me .
after about three weeks later , she came back and said , &quot; well , i asked her , &quot; and i asked her what ? &quot;
and if i say she says , &quot; if she says , &quot; she says , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; i don &apos;t believe it until she said , &quot; i am . &quot;
and this is what she wants her , and she wants her .
the only challenge is that she &apos;s only eight .
my mother was a young woman .
and when i look at all of my time , she noticed that she did with her eyes .
my  UNK  are always drifting .
and i remember when i woke up in the morning , i woke up in the morning every morning .
i am sitting on my shoulder , and my husband &apos;s boyfriend .
at the beginning , i think we were doing it .
i looked at her , but i was very happy to her , but she was .
it &apos;s about 10 years old , and he said , &quot; hi , she &apos;s going to come up with me , and i want to talk to you about this . &quot;
it &apos;s like yesterday yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
and she came to me and said , &quot; well , i said , &quot; you don &apos;t want to talk to you . &quot;
and i said , &quot; oh my god . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , i said , &quot; let &apos;s do it . &quot;
and then she sat down , and we looked at me , and i said , &quot; you know , i &apos;m going
and she said , &quot; well , you &apos;re a child . &quot;
and she said , &quot; well , i &apos;m so grateful . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and she said , &quot; i &apos;ll give you three things to me . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
and she said , &quot; well , i would love you , because your mother would be your mother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; you know , she &apos;s my mother , and you will hug you her . &quot;
and i love , i love , and i said , &quot; oh my god , i &apos;m going . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s going to be a hard , and be hard , and , you you , , you , , . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; okay , okay , i &apos;m going to . &quot;
and then finally , she said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to you . &quot;
and i came back , and i said , &quot; oh my god , i didn &apos;t have to do it . &quot;
i grew up with my father , and i grew up , and i grew up with me , and i grew up with me .
and when i walked back to my father , i told my mother &apos;s day -- he &apos;s my son -- and i -- -- i -- -- i -- i -- -- i -- i -- -- i -- i
it &apos;s got mad .
he hired one of them , and then he drank , and then he gave me a  UNK  meal .
and i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t do it . &quot;
and i said , &quot; oh my god , we all know what we do .
and so i said , &quot; oh , you &apos;ve got a drink , and you . &quot;
and i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t want to pay you . &quot;
my name is numb .
ask , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and he came up with me , and he said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to do this , &quot; don &apos;t have you . &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you mean ? &quot;
he said , &quot; he said , &quot; well , it &apos;s very different . &quot;
this is my face .
now i want to talk to you about this .
maybe it shouldn &apos;t be here .
because this is what happens next year .
and i &apos;m going to show you no one i &apos;ve never seen this year .
this is not the  UNK  for self-transcendence for self-transcendence .
and when we think about what we can do is we make them the best we can .
we can do what they do in the world .
and when i think she speaks her , i think , of course , she has a lot .
my grandfather was in prison because they were in prison .
i &apos;m not just going to die and die .
these are the principles that i believe we should .
and what i want to tell you about is that we have a system of our system .
and that &apos;s a lot of these countries in this country .
in 1998 , there was a prison prison .
today , there &apos;s a  UNK  .
today , the united states in the u.s.
we have a lot of people with  UNK  and  UNK  .
and that seems to me in my view of the world .
in rural communities , communities , communities in the united states , and the in these communities .
one percent of the men in burkina faso is in the middle of the room , whether it &apos;s not a prisoner &apos;s dilemma , or in the middle of the room .
at the university of maryland -- the city -- the city of san francisco -- the city of san francisco -- the high school -- the city -- the high school -- the high school -- the high school -- the high school -- the high school -- the high school -- the high school -- the high school -- the city of high school -- the city of high school -- the city of high school -- the city of high school -- the city of san francisco .
our heritage system is not just changing , but it &apos;s changing .
the united nations is in the united nations , if you &apos;re not , you , you , ,
wealth is not the case , but it &apos;s not the
and yet , what we &apos;re doing ?
the fear of fear of fear of fear and our fear of fear of fear of our enemies .
UNK  .
i was interested in this .
we &apos;ve been working together a little bit of fun .
and i said , in many ways , if you make a difference in politics , you can transcend democracy .
now , black men and women are dying in black men .
and let &apos;s look at the level of this level of economic growth as a result of economic growth .
but nobody has spoken word .
i mean , children are children .
a lot of my young men .
the united nations is the only child in the world .
the child was born in the refugee camp .
we &apos;re actually doing this for those people .
the world is a
i &apos;ve been trained for a long time .
that &apos;s something that happened .
we &apos;ve learned from the problems that we &apos;ve learned from people who are terrorists from them .
that &apos;s a very reasonable problem .
but on the other side , the question is itself .
another way of thinking about whistleblowers is that people don &apos;t want to kill them , but we don &apos;t want them .
i mean , this is a problem .
the u.s. is in the u.s.
every single incident every single one of the genocide has been killed by accident .
one of the people who -- this is one of the nobel laureates .
i mean , i &apos;m very careful .
and if you know , there &apos;s a lot of people in this room if we &apos;re going to get rid of an airplane in the room , if you &apos;re not going
but we can get rid of our problems .
because this is not an issue .
this is not our fault .
it &apos;s not our imagination .
there &apos;s a lot of problems .
now , we have a heart attack , and we vote .
it &apos;s great . when i talk about the history of history in history and history .
and they &apos;re going to talk about the big bang in the middle of the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know about this .
but it &apos;s a huge difference in the country .
in many cases , there are many people in the community .
people were worried about being attacked .
that was the era of change , and they changed their lives .
now at the end of september 11th , and i said , &quot; oh , you know , i &apos;m going to talk about global warming and said , &quot; hey , we &apos;re not going to help . &quot;
and they said , &quot; well , i think it &apos;s a great deal . &quot;
at the end of the time , of course , of course , there was the gap between the civil war and civil wars .
however , we &apos;re not dealing with this problem .
we don &apos;t talk about it .
that &apos;s why we don &apos;t understand what we do .
we &apos;re going through the conflict .
it keeps the nervous system .
we don &apos;t believe that we don &apos;t believe that because we don &apos;t believe that we don &apos;t believe that we don &apos;t know .
in south africa , south africa , we don &apos;t know that we can &apos;t stand up , unless we don &apos;t stand up .
in the united states , even after the united states , , , , we ,
i &apos;m also in the u.s.
and it turns out that a lot of people say , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s great , because you &apos;re talking about this , you know , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you . &quot;
she said , &quot; he said , &quot; no .
of course , we don &apos;t have the chance to survive . &quot;
society said , &quot; let &apos;s say , &quot; let &apos;s see if we were going , &quot; because we , we
it &apos;s hard to go to prison , and we
i thought about this issue .
and what if i look at my innocence , what would i see if i mean , what would i mean , what would i mean , what would i see ?
i don &apos;t care .
that &apos;s not enough .
however , in the cold war , we were in a country where we were , in fact , in fact , when we were in prison , we were in a country where you weren &apos;t afraid because of the people that you would say , in fact , in a prison -- not as much as if you were , you know , as if you &apos;re a black woman -- that &apos;s not a  UNK  woman .
however , we &apos;re still not .
and i believe that this is a crisis for us .
and when we &apos;re dealing with these problems , we tend to talk about these kinds of problems .
we love love .
we love love , we love technology .
we love love .
but ultimately , when it comes out of the day , the  UNK  and the , the the and the
and for me , it &apos;s essential for me .
because ultimately , when we talk more , more importantly , more , more , more , more and more , more and more , more and more , more of the
and that &apos;s really hard for me to talk about the poor and the poor people who don &apos;t have to worry about poverty .
but it turns out that they &apos;re actually living in their lives .
and you know , we need to believe that we don &apos;t .
we have to be smart , social , society .
frugal innovation , not only the nature of our bodies .
it &apos;s what we call our individuality and our collective intelligence .
and this is what i &apos;m going to do is i believe that it &apos;s not just the right thing that we do , and the the
UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
he said , &quot; he said , &quot; when we think about it , but when we think about the dangers of a compromise , but it &apos;s a big change in the middle of the world war . &quot;
the core of my mind is that i think of my ted talk , is that we
now , there &apos;s no sense of the technology that we can and the , the , the , the , the , the , , , , , , , ,
and i want to remind you that these are the ways that you &apos;re supposed to be
it will affect you .
when i was a young pianist , i was a young woman .
martin luther king had murdered her neighbors , and every single one of her friends , her husband and her husband and her husband , who would have been to say to her husband and her husband &apos;s wife .
these c.o.s were discussing discussing questions .
sometimes the other guy came to me , and i said , &quot; hey , i &apos;d come back and said , &quot; hey , i &apos;m going
you &apos;re going to come up with a conversation ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; oh , yes , i will . &quot;
and she said , &quot; what would you do ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; i want to go . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to get past few days later .
and these are very happy and inspiring .
and one day later , when i heard three weeks ago , i asked her , &quot; and i asked her , &quot;
and i &apos;m going to tell you what to do . &quot;
and so i began to  UNK  .
i said , &quot; let &apos;s say we don &apos;t know what to do .
we want to help people with the  UNK  .
we want to fight against terrorists and ignorance .
give birth to an emergency school diploma .
we wanted to make a difference .
we want to save lives .
we also want to be  UNK  . &quot;
i did an interview with a joke , and she said , &quot; i said , &quot; oh , i &apos;m not worthy . &quot;
and she said , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s going to work very , very , . &quot;
and as soon as she said , she said , &quot; honey , and i &apos;m happy to say , &quot; i want to call it , and she &apos;s very happy . &quot;
i &apos;d like to have a chance to stand up there for a long time .
and we need to find these questions , to find those problems .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
work in my work .
i learned a very simple principle .
and so , i began to understand that we believe that we believe that we should be .
i believe that every person on this planet .
if he was a democrat , he was an atheist .
and if he doesn &apos;t do that , he doesn &apos;t have a  UNK  .
you don &apos;t even know what you &apos;re saying is a  UNK  .
because i believe that there must be a fundamental law that requires dignity .
i believe that many of us in many countries in many countries , but we don &apos;t have a lot of countries that are not .
i don &apos;t believe it .
and i think , in many places , there are lots and lots of poverty .
and then finally , i believe that it &apos;s really hard , but it that it &apos;s not possible , but we it that it by , it , it
and finally , you know , we &apos;re not going to people who are the people who we , , ,
because this is what we really want to do is really understand what we &apos;re seeing .
i &apos;d like to end the story .
i work harder .
everybody , everybody else .
and sometimes it &apos;s very difficult to think about it , and it &apos;s very difficult .
i &apos;ve been doing this for a long time .
i went to them , as i said , as you know , as a group of being attacked by being attacked by being attacked .
and i started thinking , &quot; how do you know ?
how could somebody be a person in a different person ?
this guy says , he &apos;s a boy , but i &apos;m a boy .
and one night i woke up in the morning , and i woke up with the idea , and i thought , &quot; why would that god would take away from god .
he &apos;s right , it &apos;s a  UNK  , , . . .
you &apos;re  UNK  .
because , since then , i had no recollection , and i didn &apos;t want to do that .
i have a party , a young boy , black children .
and i started thinking , &quot; what did i do , he said , &quot; mr. smith , i &apos;m an entrepreneur : entrepreneur smith , m.p. , sir smith , who is a  UNK  subsidiary . &quot;
in this case , i went to prison and said , &quot; i &apos;ve been asked .
this is called  UNK   UNK  , and it &apos;s almost like  UNK  .
and i woke up on the morning , and i thought , &quot; i thought i was , i was a
and it &apos;s not scary , but it &apos;s not me
a few months later , there was a few months .
and finally , i decided i &apos;d like to go back to the end of the city .
i nervously very nervous -- very nervous .
and i went to court .
and i &apos;m thinking about this , and it will be painful .
and finally , i ended up with the end of the world .
and when i went to notre dame , i had an employee .
and he was looking at me , and he said , &quot; are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes , sir , i said , &quot; sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir , sir . &quot;
this guy gave me a hug for me .
he was talking about me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m proud . &quot;
well , i have to admit that you have to admit that , i &apos;m going to admit that .
and he reminded me that it would be worthy of all the richness that would be better for me , and that would be better for everyone .
so i went to court .
i &apos;m going to go back to see if i look at it .
&quot; sir , sir , sir did you do this ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , we &apos;ve been doing it . &quot;
and people were laughing because they were angry .
i did write a lot of things .
the police and police officers , and he also got it .
i didn &apos;t talk about war ii , and we weren &apos;t paying attention to a few years ago , because we weren &apos;t paying attention to us .
and i was on the third side of the front door , and so forth .
after all , he &apos;s got upset with people .
and he &apos;s walking around him .
and the end of this , black men , black men and i sat in the middle of the audience , and i sat there .
three minutes later , let &apos;s try it .
in the midst of the  UNK  , the , the of the
this guy is  UNK  , which is  UNK  .
charlie said , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
this guy looked at his head , and he said , &quot; look at me , and he said , &quot; look , i want to see him , &quot; look , &quot; look at me . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to explain why because there &apos;s a lot of people in this world where there is a lot of reasons why it works .
we care about human beings , and we can &apos;t really care about .
we live every single one and every one .
we &apos;ve been working with the design for designers and designers and creativity and creativity and creativity .
and the most important thing i want to see is that every time i want to see if you &apos;re walking down and you &apos;re looking at this , you look at this .
thank you .
what you &apos;ve heard here is that the people who want to do is that you want to make a difference in the world
well , what do you do about that ?
brian : opportunities for opportunities .
now , if you &apos;re going to show you this year , in california , it &apos;s about a tenth of a tenth of about a tenth of a tenth of a tenth of california , which is what we &apos;re going to save lives in the u.s. economy .
for example , california , in california , california , california , california billion dollars a year .
and at the same time , there &apos;s nothing more than a
it &apos;s 60 percent , and it &apos;s not .
this is an opportunity .
and this is going to put money on the back of the money back and forth .
and i think that opportunity to help us .
on the u.s. right now , there &apos;s a large number in the u.s.
some people say that there is a low dose of obesity .
what would you say about this person ?
ng : absolutely , no one has changed .
this country is not a single country in afghanistan .
it &apos;s based on drugs .
this is where we get the main reason .
we &apos;re walking around the edge of the road .
at the same time , we get a little bit of a donation to a little bit about the paycheck , and to a little bit of , and to a , , to a
i believe we need more to believe that we need more to believe that people are not more tolerant .
now , i want to think about who i &apos;m not
and i think this should be a change .
so , here &apos;s an example of your birthday .
what you &apos;re doing this is a guy named  UNK  .
thank you so much for ted . thank you .
shereen el feki : the threat is threatened .
UNK   UNK  : 3 : three  UNK  : the  UNK
fifth 4 : 4 a.m. : the  UNK
UNK   UNK  : 5 : 10 million people .
UNK   UNK  : the  UNK
UNK   UNK  : the destruction of war , war .
UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
crisis , disaster , disaster .
oh my god !
ray kurzweil : that &apos;s the first step in the last six years . it &apos;s a couple of years ago when i &apos;ve been used in the last six years .
the key news is that the intensity of our emotions are more nuanced because they are more sensitive to us .
and of course , of course , there &apos;s a reason to do that .
and it turns out that we &apos;ve collected a lot of information that we collected information from the brain .
and there are no more important information processing , it &apos;s just one of the most important information in the brain of information that is called  UNK  .
our brain is early in our early &apos; 90s , early childhood , early days .
it all boils across all of the information , and every one of the
so every time we go online , we don &apos;t read the information .
the headline has been very popular in the dictionary . it &apos;s a bad word .
and we have  UNK  devices , and we &apos;ve all kinds of things that are .
no one thinks it is .
but maybe the truth is .
it &apos;s not the result of what we do .
our societies have been a social progress in the past , and in fact , a lot of the ,
now , i don &apos;t mean that the climate crisis is affecting the climate crisis and climate change .
as humans as humans , we know what we &apos;re going to do , but we
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s going to happen next to us in the past .
over the last hundred years , we &apos;ve doubled the times more than three times more than 1,000 times , and three times more than 1.3 percent of the population growth .
mortality mortality rate down .
they don &apos;t need to go down to 10 times , 1,000 times , 1,000 times a gallon .
steve  UNK  : we &apos;re in the history of mankind , in the history of mankind .
there &apos;s an old man who has gone from one percent of the past 25 percent of the past 25 percent of the past 25 percent of the past 80 percent of the past 80 percent of the past .
we live in a great age .
a lot of people died .
we &apos;re constantly going to have the
in fact , we &apos;ve got a lot of
think of what most of you are spending in the united states today , water , water , water , water , water , water .
the worst part of the 20th century in the 20th century , the life of the life that never existed .
and this technology is technology that technology is exponential growth .
and my friend of mine showed that i showed you earlier today , and that &apos;s what happens is that there &apos;s a new amount of impact that &apos;s happened in the u.k.
so that &apos;s why you have to save more than 10 times more than 10 times more or less than 10 times more than 1,000 times more than 1,000 times more than 1,000 times more than 1,000 times more than 1,000 dollars .
look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law .
and what i want to show you is that there &apos;s something that &apos;s happened .
first of all , it &apos;s really bad news -- it &apos;s a bad thing -- it &apos;s not bad or bad , or  UNK  , or bad .
and that &apos;s because computers can make a computer faster .
it doesn &apos;t matter because we &apos;re facing the big challenge .
so on the left , the blue line is still flat , and it &apos;s still flat .
technology has changed faster and faster .
and at the end of this conference , we &apos;ve been talking about this is a great deal of innovation .
what i &apos;m doing , i &apos;m working with the internet , and , , , the , , , , , , the , , , , , , , , , , the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
how many of you know how many of the  UNK  of the
that &apos;s great .
and i looked at the best news that i saw was best .
and i like , &quot; i love the human nature . &quot;
UNK  is not easy .
it &apos;s a very hard time to see the human mind .
imagine what you can imagine is that every single person in this country like this .
four years ago , i joined four years ago , when i was a graduate student at ted university .
we &apos;ve been working with students to tackle these technologies that are really important to challenge the challenges of technology .
and every year , we have a company called  UNK  , a year or a year or a year , and a half a million dollars a year .
imagine a group of millions of people who live in today .
30 years ago , it sounds like crazy .
we can have done today that we have today .
and when i think about the creation of life , i create life , and i create a life that create life and create a great life .
it &apos;s the resource of resources .
UNK  is the power of technology , and it &apos;s a resource resource .
let &apos;s give you an example .
this is a story that &apos;s happened in the  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
he &apos;s on the left side .
he invited them to lunch .
all of the use of the use of  UNK  used to be used by using  UNK  .
but the king of the  UNK  of the
one of the most is the most , the
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s called  UNK  .
even if it &apos;s worth of the planet earth , it &apos;s not a  UNK  .
it &apos;s a combination of  UNK  and  UNK  .
but then what happens is that the technology comes along , and it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it turns out that it &apos;s called  UNK  .
let &apos;s start with this application .
let &apos;s think about energy consumption .
ladies and gentlemen , we have this huge amount of energy per day , and we &apos;ve accounted for a billion dollars .
and every 20 minutes will be the equivalent of today .
the problem is not the problem .
now there are good news .
this year is the cost of an agricultural cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of a billion dollars a year and a half billion dollars .
last year , the cost of solar .
last year , 23 years ago , it &apos;s estimated that the u.s. vehicle fleet in the u.s. vehicle fleet in the u.s. vehicle , which is the equivalent of the vehicle fleet in the u.s.
and if we have clean water , we have water .
we &apos;re going to go through war ii .
do you remember it ? the sun , the earth &apos;s orbit earth -- the earth &apos;s orbit of orbit earth -- and in the middle of the world
what happened in the name of his name ?
&quot;  UNK  . &quot;
because we live life on earth .
70 percent of water is covered by water .
yes , it &apos;s a  UNK  in the middle east , and in the gulf world , we we we ,
there are 2.5 billion people in the future , but it &apos;s not going to be the next 10 years .
we have a pacemaker technology .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about the ted conference in the morning -- and i &apos;ve been working on a ted talk about what &apos;s happened -- and i &apos;m going to show you some of what &apos;s happened in my life -- and i &apos;m going to show you some of what &apos;s going to happen -- i &apos;m going to show you some of what &apos;s going on .
and every single cubic cubic centimeter of water , every single one of the water supplies , the water is about a tenth of a tenth of a million gallons of water .
and the latest commission that you see here in the developing world &apos;s edition of developing countries .
if i &apos;m successful successful , it will be successful , and if it &apos;s successful , it will be successful in the developing world .
this is the kind of digital technology that has been created by technology .
we &apos;re seeing in the field .
my family , the rest of the developing world &apos;s developing countries .
so imagine that it &apos;s been used in a country in kenya , and a half of the 25 percent of the 25 years ago .
if they were using google , you know , a few years ago , the number of information , the
they &apos;re living in an area of information and a half of people in the world .
and there &apos;s a whole raft of information that we &apos;ve stored , and our ability to use the information technology , the ability to allow you to do with your smartphone , your smartphone , your smartphone and your smartphone .
that &apos;s the best part of the best possible .
for me , i &apos;m going to end up with the new york times more than 10 years ago .
we &apos;re going to try to have a 3d printer in the middle of this device , and it &apos;s going to be able to allow you to do this device , because it will allow them to be able to interact with it .
in order to do better , you need to be able to provide a better government than a city .
imagine this for 25 percent of health workers in the developing world .
if this vaccine is going to happen to sequence of the dna sequencing of dna sequencing , and it will soon as soon as soon as soon as possible .
and there &apos;s also the world &apos;s ability to create the world .
i call this &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
and that &apos;s the one .
more than 90 percent of the planet .
by the way , by the way , by the way , the more people the best way to earn more of the
in 2010 , we are 6.8 billion people .
in 2020 , it will be 15 billion billion dollars .
thirty billion dollars a billion dollars a billion dollars in new york .
what do they want ?
what are they going to do ? what ?
what we &apos;re going on is the largest economy , the largest economy .
these are millions of people worldwide billion dollars in the global economy .
they &apos;re getting faster because they &apos;re getting older and faster and faster , because it &apos;s much more useful , because it &apos;s much more useful , because it &apos;s much more useful , because it &apos;s much more useful , but it &apos;s much more useful .
thirty billion more than 30 years , what are we going to do with health care ?
we &apos;ve never seen before we &apos;ve never seen before .
and then there was a lot of people who were trying to get other people , and to the and to the and to the and to the to the other .
what about 30 minutes ?
and perhaps we &apos;re all wondering , can we ?
and what i &apos;ve learned is that the last three days of the industrial revolution is that this process is to make sure that this process is going to make a difference between what &apos;s going on .
so i &apos;d like to tell you a story about a story .
some of you may have heard about this .
it &apos;s a game called  UNK  .
it comes from san francisco .
it &apos;s a smartphone and a protein that allows us to build a protein and how it works .
it activates the structure of the structure of the structure .
and this is very important .
at this point , it &apos;s a computer program .
this game game is playing games .
and hundreds of thousands of people started playing football game .
it &apos;s also more than cataloging than ever since the best computer .
when you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s a graduate student from the university of iowa , but it &apos;s not done by the  UNK  , and , , , ,
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;ve been working on this journey , and i believe that this is a great challenge for us to the future .
we have tools tools and technology .
there &apos;s a passion for passion .
and all of you have the capacity to be a
and at the same time that &apos;s been working together with a group of people working together to work together , we have to do something to do that .
we &apos;re going to be successful
thank you .
i think there are cultural developments in the culture of cultural culture , but it &apos;s going to change culture .
and this can start with me , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe since i &apos;ve been doing this , because i &apos;ve been able to get some of the
now , over the course of the discussion we talked about the 21st century .
why not ?
it &apos;s going to happen in the world , ,
we all call it , right ?
more than half of the world .
statistically  UNK  statistics .
it &apos;s about how to write about the great story about how to write about how to make a great deal with the  UNK  .
i &apos;d like to show you a story about the data .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
when we talk about the  UNK  of the  UNK   UNK  .
we &apos;re so grateful for a  UNK  nut , so that you &apos;re going to be
it means that the landlord is being beaten by  UNK  , and that means that you don &apos;t have to go through the  UNK  , and so forth .
a couple of minutes later .
do you know what the baseball baseball baseball ?
great , great , great .
and you know how many of you know how to do it .
it &apos;s about four or four hours every day .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s like a baseball baseball -- he &apos;s in the last two years old , and in a baseball baseball baseball .
now , let &apos;s go back to the world , but now , i the , . i &apos;m i
so , you &apos;ve got to say , you &apos;ve got one of the  UNK  of the  UNK  , and of the
that sounds ridiculous , right ?
or what would you do is you think of a group of people in sao paulo , one of the  UNK  in sao paulo , one of the  UNK  in sao paulo , and you can see what &apos;s going to happen .
but , you know , what are you doing ?
she had a huge impact on her , and she was affected .
her &quot;  UNK   UNK  . &quot;
but it doesn &apos;t work .
and now i want to ask you a question .
what do you do , you know , a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a surgeon or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor or a surgeon ?
good ? yeah .
in fact , there &apos;s a lot of people who don &apos;t know , one of the , or a , , , a
and each of them , every one of us , i &apos;m convinced myself to myself , each of them , to make sure that it &apos;s perfect .
it &apos;s absolutely irrelevant , but we don &apos;t have any incentive to think about it , but we
and that &apos;s where i get my medical information .
i &apos;m an academic student .
once again , one of the things that happens when the monkey comes out when he comes back to sleep .
and i do that .
i learned this in my garage , and in my garage , i my students in my house , in my house , in my home .
i &apos;ve been looted everything .
and i clicked on every single one of every single one of every single one of the muscle that i &apos;ve seen , in the heart of the muscle , the muscle , and the  UNK  and the and the
i even know how to make a difference between the  UNK  .
and in time , i became more and more .
well , my graduate student is  UNK  .
and when i was thinking about this , i was thinking about everything that i learned from all the things that i had , and all the things that i i was going to do , i could , and i
and i didn &apos;t have time for a long time .
and  UNK   UNK  , who &apos;s been  UNK  a hospital at the university of michigan , and i was working in a hospital working in toronto .
and i &apos;d been trying to get rid of the police departments , and i
and my job is that when i &apos;m working with a patient , is a heart attack .
and then onwards came back to the fbi .
when i met her , she was very shy .
when i heard her voice , i heard her voice .
when i was listening to my voice , i was listening to my voice , and my wife &apos;s voice .
this is the blood flow of blood flow , and the blood flow from the blood flow , and the blood flow from the blood flow , and the blood flow from the blood flow of blood flow , and the blood flow from the blood flow of blood flow , and the blood flow from the blood flow , and the blood flow from the blood flow , and the blood flow from the blood flow , and the blood flow in the blood flow , and the blood flow from the blood flow , and the blood
it &apos;s not an option .
and after treatment , i started to diagnose her treatment .
she gave birth to her , and she could get her for her .
and i brought her back to her , and then she came to her , and she was able to bring her back into her lungs .
over the course of the next 10 years , she went out .
i &apos;ve got a confession .
and it was the first mistake that went back to me .
in my mind , i &apos;m going to make two mistakes .
and i slept in bewildered her home , and i took her back home .
i don &apos;t have to do that , and i have to do it for him , and i asked him to give him a chance to give him a chance to give him a chance to give him a chance to give him a chance to give him a chance to give him a chance to give him a chance to give him a chance to do that .
and my husband , she knows that she knows more than anything else .
and i think that &apos;s probably the reason .
and i don &apos;t want to have to do anything that need to be a  UNK  .
now , may be able to hold my mind , and i can tell him , and i can raise my husband .
and the second mistake i &apos;m getting worse .
and when i went home , i went home to my wife , and she tried to do that , &quot; don &apos;t do that anymore . &quot;
and i didn &apos;t have enough time thinking about this , and i thought , &quot; okay , is that her husband can &apos;t help her husband &apos;s boyfriend . &quot;
and the nurse thought , &quot; well , i thought , &quot; no , no problem . &quot;
and everything else has happened to me .
i met with my grandmother , and when i went home , i went back home .
and then i moved back to my office .
on the day day day , day day , my father &apos;s day , the day of my life .
but i still continue to work .
after the end of my job , i quit my job , and at the end of my job , i decided to do a job in my house , and i did not do what i do .
i &apos;ve gone from my car .
and then , after another week , after three months , i heard momma said , &quot; no , i &apos;m afraid to tell you about three weeks ago .
now , there are three doctors doctors , but it &apos;s not the case for three months , and this is what we want to do .
so three : these are the words ?
&quot; do you remember that ? &quot;
the nurse nurse .
&quot; again , she goes back again and again , and that &apos;s the same thing .
and she &apos;s coming back .
it goes back to death .
and i went back home , and i went back to her home , and she went back home , and she had gone back home , and she had gone back home , and she had gone back home , and she had gone back to her breasts , and she had grown up with her breasts , and she had grown up with her breasts .
her body was quiet ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
and of course ensures this  UNK  .
and they came up with her lungs .
and she puts her on the keyboard .
i was shocked , and i was struck .
and then when i was growing up , i loved her because i wanted to see what was going to happen when i wanted to see what would happen next to her husband .
but over the course of the next big bang , she gets bigger and bigger .
her brain has gone through the spinal cord .
she was born with her family .
over the next couple of years , they were clueless .
at the end of her family , her family , her family and her family , her family , her family .
someone says that you will never forget the name of your name .
and that was the first time that i realized i was .
and over the course of the last couple of years , i &apos;ve spent the last few weeks of medicine and medicine , because of the health care of the health care of medicine , which is why you don &apos;t care about it .
that &apos;s the right thing that you did , but you know , that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that you would have told
and after 9 / 11 , you &apos;ve done something like this , and you &apos;ve done it .
it &apos;s a
and what i &apos;m talking about is that if you don &apos;t have a  UNK
it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re wrong , but you don &apos;t do it .
and this is what i felt .
and that &apos;s not my fault , because it &apos;s very good .
he was born with his family , and he said to me , and i couldn &apos;t afford that .
but i &apos;m still asking myself questions .
why didn &apos;t i was there ? why am i going to go home ?
i was surprised when i was asked to ask myself , why would i be happy wrong ?
why am i going to take you ?
and slowly slowly slowly slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly , slowly .
and i started thinking .
and then when i thought , i thought , i thought , i thought i would be a  UNK  , and i , and i , , , , , .
and then i then said to myself , well , if i &apos;ve done my own voice , then i &apos;m going to try and make the perfect choice to make the perfect choice .
it &apos;s been stopped .
i went back to the .
but it happened .
two years later , when i was walking in my village , i went to a family with a family in a city with a family in the neighborhood .
and at that time , so i had a lot of time , and so i was so .
he kept on the ground .
so i looked at this , and he looked at his face .
and i gave him a  UNK  him out of his house .
even though , when he was in his 80s , he was
after 9 / 11 , i woke up in the morning , and i noticed that there was an invitation to meet her office .
and she said , &quot; well , what ?
do you remember ? &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
he turns out , it &apos;s not  UNK  .
and you have to realize that there is something that &apos;s called  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
you can &apos;t see it , but it , it , it , it , it , it , it , it &apos;s
sadly , he wasn &apos;t dismayed .
after a few days after he did , he lost his leg .
and i went back to the back and back and forth back and forth , and then i went back to the back and back and forth back and forth .
i &apos;m looking at the same  UNK  , and , , i the
it &apos;s an interesting thing that happens when you &apos;re in a hospital in a hospital in a hospital .
for two years , i didn &apos;t care about them , but for me , it would allow you to be able
one of them , i met him .
and it turned out , and it was time to see my colleagues , and in the older patients , it turns out the patient &apos;s friend , and it turns out that the patient &apos;s friend .
another patient is a .
so i took some of my colleagues , and he took my friend , and he said to me .
and he did it . he found some of the patients who had patients with patients , and he found his patients .
and those two patients have done surgery .
but every time i get a feeling of anxiety , i feel like this .
and i can tell you that my favorite statistic of my life is going to happen , but one of my life , i &apos;ve been the last 10 years old .
over the last five years , i &apos;ve been doing some mistakes .
i still feel guilty ,  UNK  .
but the question the question is , if my question is , how can i be honest with my fantasies , and if i can &apos;t even if my colleagues can &apos;t even if my father-in-law can i be able to do that ?
how do i teach them to make them better ?
and when i was an athlete , i &apos;m going to show you how i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m .
and on the other day , when you &apos;re talking about yourself , what ?
yes , some of you may have heard a few seconds ago , and if you were talking about somebody else , you may not have heard about somebody else &apos;s wrong .
now , if i &apos;m going to go back and interview them to interview them , and then i &apos;ve been trying to convince them , and then they , and then they , and then they will , and then they will .
in fact , in my colleague , in my colleague , in my colleague , the surgeon has a heart of my leg , and i , and see if he has a heart , and , , and , , and , and , and ,
so this is what we have .
a  UNK  system .
it turns out that there &apos;s only two versions of the only difference between the two and the ones that are not good enough .
it &apos;s almost like the immune response to the immune system like the immune system .
we have an idea that when we think of security clearance , we can get rid of our lives .
but this idea is going to be a problem .
in my medical school , i learned from the medical medical school , which i learned from the medical industry , and i learned from the medical industry , and i learned from my medical school , and i learned from my medical records and medical records .
and the opposite of the things i learned is that the opposite .
we take a lot of hospitals in hospitals , and we know that every single dose of cancer and death will die , and it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to die .
in this country , there are three billion children in the  UNK  of the .
in the united states , in the united states , , ,
in addition to the fact that data doesn &apos;t matter whether we look at the data , because we don &apos;t know what happens .
the point is .
it &apos;s a medical knowledge of knowledge of knowledge of knowledge of knowledge that we had learned from the knowledge of knowledge .
i mean , there &apos;s a lot .
and we can &apos;t get rid of this problem .
and we can get feedback to the test of our patients , and then we can test for the patient .
but if it was the same with the patient , the , of the , the , the , ,
and this doesn &apos;t work .
i &apos;m not going to do it . it &apos;s the same thing that we do .
my same way in the same way they don &apos;t have time , and the same way they
so it &apos;s the opposite .
and if i &apos;ve been quoted in the &apos; 80s , the  UNK  of the , the , the , the , , the . . . .
and there are people who say that they don &apos;t know about it .
and in my book , &quot; i found myself , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to , i &apos;m the , i the , i the , i the , &quot; and i the , &quot; , i the , &quot; and i the , &quot; and i the , &quot; and i the , &quot; and i &apos;m i the other . &quot;
they would walk , and they would look at their faces , and then they would come back and forth .
they want to tell stories that they tell stories about their stories .
they want to say , &quot; listen to me , and it &apos;s like the same thing . &quot;
they &apos;re just going to be a
what they need is a culture culture .
one doctor is a doctor .
now , who is dr. russell , dr. russell , who is cursed , and then she deserves her , and then it turns out that it &apos;s actually a human being endowed .
she lives with her experience .
and talk about people talking about their wallets .
she doesn &apos;t make a difference in a certain way of thinking about how to do that , but to make a difference .
and what she did was that she was done in the &apos; 70s , and it was done by a  UNK  system , and it was a  UNK  system .
so this system has prevented in a way that way , it &apos;s possible for us to get rid of our civilization , and it &apos;s kind of a hard way that we &apos;re trying to deal with it , and we way we &apos;re trying to deal with it , it , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
i &apos;m an actor .
i was a doctor doctor .
i am an astronaut , and i am a human .
and so i &apos;m so sorry , but i &apos;m going to try and figure out what &apos;s going on .
i still believe that i &apos;m still not sure i can do it , but i can .
and finally , i &apos;d like to finish with me , and i said , &quot; well , i ain &apos;t . &quot;
now , in the 20th century , there was a few dollars in the government , and if you had done it .
you have to take a sample of a sample of a hydrostatic skeleton .
so , the government will come back to the government .
what they found is that if they were able to find out what they could do ?
and the reason why we don &apos;t know how to make it possible , it &apos;s going to happen .
we &apos;ve never seen ourselves in this country .
but in 2011 , if you were able to print a designer today , every single one of us would print a few weeks , you could print a piece of paper cups , every single piece of paper , and if you print a piece of paper cups , you can print a piece of paper .
this is what happened today .
it seems counterintuitive .
this is an example of how we use these technologies that are using these technologies .
this is one of the main problems of the web .
if we look at what the world is , what happens ?
we have three problems .
we have emails online .
so here we go from stratford , massachusetts ,  UNK   UNK  .
online criminals can be understood .
these guys pay for money .
they get money to pay money , money , money .
we actually went online , and in fact , there are all kinds of tweets that are online , and it &apos;s wireless .
and here &apos;s  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
this is doug engelbart .
this is the  UNK  .
this is  UNK   UNK  .
this is  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
these nets are thousands of millions of people who are using money , and we &apos;re using money to pay attention to the internet , but we &apos;re using money to send money to pay attention to the internet , and we &apos;re using money to send money through the internet , and we &apos;re using money to send money through the internet , and we &apos;re using money to send money through the internet .
there was nine months ago , a three-month bank , a three-month bank , a three-month bank , a three-month bank , a three-month bank , a three-month bank , 24th  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
hardly sir roger bannister , he knows what he knows .
today , i would argue today , is that we can create a
and it &apos;s clearly worse than that .
and the rest of the world will happen online .
the second reason why the federal government isn &apos;t we are not spending money .
and the whole thing they did is -- it &apos;s a  UNK  , .
these are the major components that are used in a couple of months in the past 12 months .
these are the main reasons for the federal government , and the main government , the government to the government , to the government to the government to the government to the government to the government to the government to the government .
let &apos;s look at what happens .
this is an example of the  UNK  of the
UNK  is one of the  UNK  of the  UNK  , or the
it was instrumental in the last year , because it &apos;s
somebody else has a  UNK  .
at the end of the day i was at the end of the day when i said , &quot; well , if there &apos;s a chance of likelihood that might have been killed , and there will be the likelihood of a disease .
and his answer is yes .
now , how do people respond to death ?
UNK  is an authority .
they sell them .
what do you do ?
what you need to do is that you have a  UNK  service , a kiosk service , a kiosk service , a kiosk service .
now , most africans , we &apos;re going to like , or the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the ,
they can also get their money , they will .
UNK   UNK  .
that &apos;s what happened in the preceding .
where is this happening in the arab spring ?
and in egypt , egypt , egypt , egypt , egypt , egypt , egypt , egypt , a few months ago .
and in this case , there &apos;s a letter called  UNK  .
there &apos;s a company called  UNK  companies , which is funded by a company called  UNK  , which is funded by a company called  UNK  .
and they took the tools for the  UNK  of the
companies are there .
so , governments are governments to be the government to give their own government .
but the government also said that they could do it .
for example , for instance , a german ago called  UNK  , a group ago , a group ago , a group ago , a group ago , a group of people who used their own group .
and if you &apos;re lucky , you &apos;re  UNK  , you &apos;re , you .
but today , there &apos;s something else .
and they will come up with you .
they &apos;re going to use all the tools that you use to use all of the tools that you use to use all of the servers , and then you use the tools to use your data , and you can use all of the files .
and when we think about it , it &apos;s going to be very , very , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
why am i going ?
i didn &apos;t even have anything else . &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s wrong .
privacy is privacy .
privacy is a conversation about privacy .
it &apos;s not a privacy issue .
it &apos;s a freedom of freedom .
in 2011 2011 , we will win the power of time , we will lose the power of power .
we &apos;re not going to the , , , , , ,
these are the solutions that we &apos;ve been waiting for .
it sounds ridiculous , and i &apos;m a little bit disappointed .
the first thing that is built up with a simple idea that is built with a simple device to build a  UNK  device .
soon after the  UNK  , the the the
it allows us to create something that we could build bridges , building bridges , building bridges .
the  UNK  has been used for us .
and about 30 years later , this is the same thing .
it was called  UNK  .
and then in a couple of years , it &apos;s been a
it &apos;s about eight billion dollars -- it &apos;s about eight billion dollars a billion dollars , and for a billion dollars .
you don &apos;t have to build a beautiful building , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful .
it &apos;s possible possible .
and in fact , in this case , what we do is we construct the building blocks of the building blocks of the building .
it &apos;s a new revolution in the next revolution , a new revolution .
and enceladus is a small part of the universe , and we &apos;re all kinds of things that allow us to create a new material into the world .
as you can make foldout , you know , it &apos;s much more complicated , more complex , more complex , more complicated .
but there &apos;s one thing that is there is a big problem : the only way we can .
i can &apos;t speak so much , so i decided that we can change the way , so i decided to make a difference .
i started thinking about 25 years ago , and when i started thinking about this project , as the architect of the architect , as a designer , by the architect of the architect .
i was a few years ago .
i &apos;m going to show you how it works .
and every one of these devices is a unique device .
they all have sensors , sensors , sensors .
and most of all of them is that they &apos;re  UNK  .
so it &apos;s impossible .
these are entanglement colors .
the blue line is blue , and the blue line is blue , and blue is the blue line , and the blue line is blue .
so what you need to do is you need to make a bigger and bigger , and then you can get the
you put your shoes into a blue box , and you can see it .
you can put a little box in a small house , and you have a little girl .
it &apos;s a krump called  UNK  , and now you have a transistor , and you a little , you
and then you get this structure in this case , and you get a
i had a  UNK  .
in fact , it &apos;s very simple , simple .
you don &apos;t have to reset your computer programming , your computer programming , your computer programming .
it &apos;s going to take you a little bit like this , or , , you the , you , , you , , you , , you , , you , , you , , you , , you , , you , , or a little bit ,
what was happening in this idea was an idea , it was a kind of  UNK  idea .
we want to connect with every one of the world around the world .
wind , the wind , the wind , the wind , the
we &apos;ve slept the kids playing with them .
it was an incredible experience .
and the first thing they started to learn is that they should learn how to read them .
for instance , how do you know how to do it , or how , or how , or how , or how to , or how to , or how to , or how , or how to work , or how .
we &apos;ve designed the design to design school .
for example , we used to look at the designers of designers designers , designers , designers , designers and designers .
and as you can see , it &apos;s kind of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,
and we got invited to a friend of mine and a half and a half ago , and said , &quot; well , some of them , architects , whatever they were . &quot;
and this is what they &apos;re doing with a  UNK  device .
and so , on the other side , it &apos;s one of my favorite projects .
it &apos;s a  UNK  contraption , and it
for those materials , materials , materials , materials ,  UNK  materials .
and we wanted to make this happen .
so  UNK  is open-source .
you can download books , you can download all of the files .
we want to make a world with everybody , because everyone in the world , we world , world , . world . world .
don &apos;t forget your name .
thank you .
