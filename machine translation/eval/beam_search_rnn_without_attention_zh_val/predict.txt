when i was nine years old , i woke up in the morning when i woke up in the morning .
my father was a father of the  UNK  of the
he was very strange , because he had a lot of his face of his face .
it &apos;s called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i don &apos;t know what it was , but i mean , it &apos;s a very useful .
&quot; you can go to school and say , &quot; go to school . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that christmas morning .
a school teacher .
i was six years old , and the taliban went to afghanistan , and the taliban went to afghanistan .
so before i was five years old , when i was asked to go to prison , i wasn &apos;t allowed to go to school for the first time .
this is one of the most people in our education .
we &apos;re going to where every day , where we go to where we are .
we put it back into the box , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to do it .
in the schools , it &apos;s a a a a
in winter , it &apos;s summer summer summer .
we know that all of our students , our teacher , our teacher &apos;s teacher , students .
occasionally , there were a couple of weeks ago , because the taliban had been silenced .
we &apos;re always worried the first time .
are we going ?
do they know what ?
we &apos;re still shy , but we still don &apos;t want to go to school .
i was one of my family at home in education .
my grandfather was a man in his grandfather .
he was one of his classmates in afghanistan , and his family came to me , and he and his family , and he , his family , and his family his family , and his family .
but my mother became a teacher .
that &apos;s her .
she took eight years ago , and i had this girl in my family , and her family and education .
my father was -- that was the father of his family .
and so it means that every child , in fact , there &apos;s a lot of money , of course , there &apos;s been a
for him , it &apos;s not a better job .
i went back to the taliban in the early days of the cold war , and when i was asked myself , i was afraid of my life , and of the
and i thought , &quot; well , my father will come to my life , and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t read your life . &quot;
your money would be your house , maybe you might be arrested .
and the only thing that you would have had to do is that if you had to get rid of your kitchen , you would have had to get rid of that , you know , if you had to get rid of that stuff .
don &apos;t you want to stay alive ? &quot;
i &apos;ve been 22 years old .
my country has been born in the past few years .
i don &apos;t care about 25 percent of the country , and if you don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t believe that i &apos;m going to die in my lifetime .
and today i &apos;m a  UNK  .
now , one of the united states came to the united states in the united states , and in the united states , i was born in south america , and i was part of my grandfather in the united states as i was born in the united states in the united states , and the of the
and the reason it was not only because it was my father , but the first time in the first time , was the first woman in the first time in the first time in the first time in the first time in the first time in the first time in the first time in india .
that &apos;s my family . trust me .
my dream is my dreams , even their dreams .
this is the reason why i call this global global ethic , and this is a global organization .
that &apos;s the first time in afghanistan : afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan , afghanistan .
but what i get excited about this is that my school students in the middle class , and in my school district , i could see students .
and what i like to see is their fathers , their fathers , their fathers , their fathers , their fathers , even though they &apos;re .
you can &apos;t see him , i don &apos;t see him , but i can &apos;t see him .
he was nine years old , and he saw his daughter , he was arrested , and he
he &apos;s got one of his daughter , and he would get his son , and he would get back to his son , and he would get his son .
&quot; if you think , &quot; my god , but i think , &quot; i think , right now i &apos;m going to you . &quot;
and for me realize that it was very important to realize that it was done in his own success , and that it was very successful , that she was successful in his own success .
it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s not important for our mothers .
in fact , in the middle of them , they were only in the middle of the , , , , , , , , , , , , , in ,
the taliban went to the taliban to go back to kenya , and when the taliban went back to afghanistan , it was the enemy .
but today , there are three million girls today .
it &apos;s very different in afghanistan .
and i found that in the united states , we see the
i worry about what &apos;s going to happen is that it &apos;s going to be
but when i come back to see what i saw when i saw this young people were going to see their grandchildren , and they will come back and see what will happen next year .
for me , it would be very happy for me to be reminded of this day , and every day of the day of my life .
it &apos;s like my dreams , i had dreams .
thank you .
what i &apos;ve been doing , what i &apos;ve been doing is i &apos;ve been working on in my life -- i &apos;ve been working on in the years -- i &apos;ve been working on a
i was born in 1971 , but i was born in 1971 -- and i went to australia -- i was born in kenya , and i went to australia -- i was lucky enough -- and i was lucky enough to see if i did a lot in kenya .
i was working in delhi in italy in italy , and i worked in italy .
i &apos;ve gone .
at that time we &apos;re in the 21st century , i think we &apos;re in the 21st century for the 21st century .
however , what do we do ?
so the first book we wrote about the first project , which is a project called  UNK  , and i decided to teach it to write a book called  UNK  .
so , we &apos;ve taken all of the trees in southern northern italy , where we go to the south bronx , and so forth , and so forth .
and of course , criminals are really reluctant to pay attention to us , and they don &apos;t have to pay attention to the same time .
there &apos;s a very large part of that , and in fact , we , and ,
but we don &apos;t just say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; let &apos;s start with them . &quot;
&quot; in the sudan , the man who lost himself . &quot;
and of course , in africa , of course , it &apos;s great .
we &apos;re not here . we know it &apos;s beautiful . it &apos;s a big picture .
it &apos;s amazing . we said , &quot; wow ! this is a lot more about this . &quot;
and when it comes out of the window , it &apos;s got all the lights off the window , and all the lights out of all the light .
and we said , &quot; oh , we &apos;ve done this . &quot;
and alexander said , &quot; well , this is why we &apos;re not here . &quot;
&quot; why do you say , &quot; why don &apos;t you ? &quot;
and i thought it would be a long time ago when we were in the united nations , and when i went to university , i knew that it was a lot of work in the u.k.
because , we &apos;ve been able to do .
and you &apos;re going to -- you &apos;ll notice that we &apos;re going to see how many of these people in the u.s.
you can read this book , &quot; this is a guy named kevin kelly , who &apos;s a writer , and he said , &quot; this is an economist , and this is an economist .
this book was published .
we think these are the last two billion dollars in the last 25 years .
i &apos;m not going to pay for you to pay attention to it .
you &apos;re looking for yourself .
let &apos;s look at how many of you can see how many women are .
and what we &apos;re seeing is one of the people , the one hand , the one hand , the one hand , the  UNK  , the
these are the two robots that are called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
it &apos;s just two different words .
my parents told me , &quot; boy , &quot; i think , &quot; kid &apos;s children . &quot;
that means that i would like to meet my  UNK  , as a person .
and that &apos;s why he &apos;s in africa , and this is called  UNK  .
and i read this book , and he wrote a book , and i read a book , and he said , &quot; the economist , &quot; if you want to help people , &quot; don &apos;t want to help people , &quot; if you don &apos;t want to read it , you don &apos;t want to know what &apos;s going to happen . &quot;
it should be the third principle of aid .
the third of the respect is that
this morning , in the morning of the morning , if you &apos;re going to the morning , you can of the , , , , , , , , , , , , , can we can of the of the
at that time , when i was working with a group of people who were trying to work , i was trying to work , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , and ,
so that &apos;s what we need to do .
we would start with a conversation with a community , not with each other .
we work in offices offices .
and we &apos;re having lunch and lunch .
we have no infrastructure infrastructure .
what we &apos;ve done is , what they &apos;re doing is that they &apos;re and
and most importantly .
and you can ask some of your ideas .
but if there &apos;s no other way , what do you do ?
now , the most important part is the most important part of the happinesses .
the integrity on the core side of the building is the most important .
and then we collect information to help them , to help them , because of the world , it &apos;s
some people know that knowledge , but we don &apos;t know , but we can .
so a few years ago , i couldn &apos;t talk about this idea , but we don &apos;t have a few years ago , but the idea that we can &apos;t , ,
i &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
there &apos;s problems with problems .
there &apos;s no money to tell them about their money , and they &apos;re money , and they , and they , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to the
so there &apos;s a plan for a plan .
you don &apos;t even notice all the people in your community , because you don &apos;t really care about it .
our idea is , we have to have infrastructure , we have infrastructure for the local infrastructure .
we have to create a new approach .
and this one of the things that will work in your home , and you can raise your money home , and you can raise your company , and you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you ,
and i &apos;ve been working on  UNK  trials in the trial .
for me , i was trying to figure out the time when i was trying to figure out what would happen in the morning .
i was in the first batch of the bookstore , and i was  UNK  , and i was , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , the , , , , the , the and the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the and the the the and the the and the the and the the and
i &apos;m going to show you five million dollars a gallon , and i &apos;m going to show you five dollars a gallon farmer , and i &apos;ll give you a meal , and if you save a meal , you can save money and save a meal , and if you save them , you can save them , and you save them , and you can save them , and save them , &quot; well , it &apos;s not going to save lives ? &quot;
one year after year , i asked myself , and i asked myself , and i asked myself , &quot; what do you do ?
so what do you do ? i said , &quot; what do i do ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what they say , &quot; listen . &quot;
so -- he said , &quot; oh , that &apos;s the . &quot;
we &apos;ve got 300 of these projects around the world .
we &apos;ve done over the course of five schools .
the difference between the  UNK  and the
peter  UNK  : one of the most prolific years , was the only one of the first time ,
edward  UNK  is an economist at the university of iowa , says , &quot; mashelkar , &quot; business and economics is a viable strategy . &quot;
the plan is to give money to help .
now , we don &apos;t know how to make sure that they &apos;re using their own  UNK  , their own .
we have to learn how to fix them .
we &apos;ve got to help them with the local communities , and we encouraged them to help them with them , and that &apos;s what we want to do with them .
in one month , we were able to 100,000 people .
can you imagine , how many of you , can and
how many of you get from the
it &apos;s a passion for them . you &apos;re a trespasser .
so what i want to say is that today is that we &apos;re born .
when we first went into the 21st century -- and we &apos;re in the 21st century -- that we &apos;re not going to -- -- that &apos;s -- that &apos;s -- that we &apos;re the
the air force in the day .
they use food stamps .
and what we want to focus on is that we care about how we care about how to cope with health care services , and how to save the food supply of health care .
the fraction of technology can do that .
who &apos;s got the technology ? did it ?
is the government ?
they are the leaders , and they &apos;re the
a couple of years ago , i wrote an article about a magazine article .
nelson mandela , nelson mandela had been invited for the future of the future .
that was 1998 . and when it was 1998 , they went back to 2009 , and then they went back to 2009 .
why ? because they say , &quot; well , if you look at it , it would be better for the last 30 years , and then you &apos;ll be able to get rid of it , and a half of the
and then people will be willing to be
so , in 1997 , it would be a new technology that would be a  UNK  technology .
so what happened ? well , the cost of the united states had been  UNK  in paris ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s a new requirement for a long time . it &apos;s a little bit .
so , for example , the  UNK  of the  UNK
however , there &apos;s a teacher .
first , you have to empower them to them .
otherwise they don &apos;t want to ask you .
and then you &apos;re going to get to the
you have to tell them .
one of the most effective companies can do is to say , what &apos;s going to do is to be called ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , the , , , , , , ,
what &apos;s the problem ?
there &apos;s one thing that never could be done in the same way .
this person doesn &apos;t exist .
it can be born .
we do companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies , companies .
all of all of the world , one of the companies in the world , only one of the world
now , we &apos;ve got 60 years old and  UNK  , and now , before i tell you how many of these guys are used to know what they do ? &quot;
&quot; i did , &quot; no , &quot; i did it . &quot;
he &apos;s not dead .
UNK  : no one wants to do it .
so we can take this community from the community , and we said , &quot; hey , what do you want to do : what you want to do : what you want to do : what you want to do ? &quot;
what can you do ? what do you do ?
can you go into the store ? can you do that ? &quot;
&quot; ah , &quot; okay , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m going to do this guy . &quot;
we depend on community campuses .
we have a team of volunteers and visionary team in the community , and we &apos;re trying to help people in the community , and , , , , the
thank you .
five years ago , i had five years ago when i was a dreamer .
college students came to college students to teach my students to teach students to teach their teachers .
i was mesmerized .
i &apos;ve been fascinated by all of them , and i &apos;ve been fascinated by all of them , and i &apos;ve been fascinated by  UNK  , and i &apos;ve been trained for them , and i &apos;ve been fascinated by myself , and i &apos;ve been trained for them .
but as soon as soon as a teenager , as i &apos;ve been exploring , i went through a whole new york city , and it has changed the world .
and that &apos;s the conversation with my kids , and when i feel that i feel like , i &apos;m going to try and feel that .
and i believe that there &apos;s a key message that there is a new way to communicate with that gap .
in order to scientists , we have to scientists and our scientists and the
our scientists are skillful , engineers , engineers , scientists , scientists , scientists , scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists and scientists , and if we &apos;re not know how to design it , if you &apos;re not , you know what ?
and if we scientists and engineers , scientists and engineers , we don &apos;t have to try to figure out that if we don &apos;t want to talk about it .
so scientists scientists like engineers , and scientists are saying , &quot; what do you do ?
so i &apos;m going to show you some of the tools that you &apos;re talking about , , and ,
the first question is : what is the answer ?
let &apos;s tell you why we do science .
and i told you to tell you that it &apos;s important for me to tell you that it &apos;s really important to do it , because it &apos;s
now , the other thing that you might think is that it &apos;s called  UNK  .
it &apos;s an idea that we have to understand .
and of course , you say , &quot; well , you know , how much of it comes to us ? &quot;
and your intuition is very simple .
instead , as simple as it turns out , it &apos;s not as simple as simple as simple as possible .
you don &apos;t need to change your ideas and science fiction .
and it &apos;s kind of fun to think about it , and , for example , about how we do it , and .
and i &apos;m going to show you that you don &apos;t have to do it for you .
why do you want to ask you a little bit of a word &quot; ? &quot;
what can we do about what we do ? a thousand years ago .
it &apos;s not just like a little bit more like a primate , not just the , ,
and this is a 3d printer that has been collected by a 3d printer , and it &apos;s very important for us to design it .
so the idea here is that there &apos;s a simple array of feedback loops , and then we can explain what &apos;s going on , and so forth is that we can understand , to understand what &apos;s going on .
and so that &apos;s what i think i &apos;m doing is that we can use the help of the technology , and to the extent of all of the world .
so since i &apos;ve done this with all of my engineers , i &apos;ve been working with this notion of what i &apos;m trying to do
now , you &apos;re using your ability to work with your ability to communicate with your brains , and i &apos;m going to share with you , what you &apos;ve done is that you &apos;ve been talking about , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , you
so scientists and engineers , scientists and engineers , engineers , engineers , you know , i &apos;m going to say .
thank you .
one of my favorite examples is one of the word &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
not just because it sounds good .
and it means &quot; is a  UNK  . &quot;
even though this was an example of a member of the 19th century , he was a member of the perfectionist of the perfectionist of the perfectionist , was the perfectionist of the perfectionist , was the perfectionist of the perfectionist , was the perfectionist of the perfectionist , he was the perfectionist , he , was the to the , was the to the , was , &quot; to the , &quot; or the , &quot; he . &quot;
i don &apos;t know what it means .
i mean , it &apos;s about words and words .
but the political leaders of politics is that they &apos;re trying to figure out what they &apos;re trying to do .
for example , for example , the supreme court said to the extent to the truth is to be honest with the truth .
and actually , because it &apos;s actually a great  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
he was arrested in london , and he was sent to london to london , and he was invited to london , and he was elected for the senate , and
and just a few years ago , we were able to get the first  UNK  of the
a lot of people think about this .
no , it &apos;s not a  UNK  .
but what &apos;s really exciting about this is that i &apos;m going to show you what i mean by looking at the past five years , when it comes back to the united states , when you look at the united states .
and so they have a question that they asked me was that they were asked to ask the civil disobedience leaders .
they don &apos;t know .
why should it be a leader ?
that &apos;s a question that has happened in congress .
and there are a lot of these ideas that are going to
i mean , some people call him washington , d.c. , washington , washington , d.c. washington , d.c. washington , d.c. washington , d.c.
there &apos;s no one .
some people think about his name for him .
they think it &apos;s an example of the past .
they don &apos;t even have a choice of choice , and that &apos;s what you can see is that islam has a elections .
you know , this will happen .
and every single one of them , for three reasons , because of course , for three years .
i &apos;ve been talking about this war , and this is a bad news , &quot; and it &apos;s a bad idea . &quot;
and the reason that the reason is because of the
autocratic don &apos;t want to pay attention to washington d.c.
they don &apos;t want to call him his name for him .
so they give him a sense of what they think about , the most famous ,  UNK  , the best of the best of the best .
and this is called  UNK  .
UNK   UNK  : there &apos;s no idea , but there &apos;s no idea , but there &apos;s an idea that there &apos;s an idea that &apos;s happened .
i mean , you can see the same as a joke .
and it &apos;s not very , very , very , very , very strong .
occasionally , there are thousands of people who don &apos;t know how it works .
and this is why this is why .
and they say , &quot; well , you can &apos;t say , &quot; you can &apos;t do this .
and this guy is going to be the one and the to the
who would think he would be like , would be a if he wanted to build a red donkey , and he wanted to be a  UNK  ?
and then there was a couple of weeks later , and it &apos;s not .
as a group of thinking , of course , of course , of course , is that the people who don &apos;t want them to be , or the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , or , the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
now , there &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be interesting to you .
first of all , i found myself , almost everything that i found myself , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in my own , maltese falcon .
barack obama , barack obama , barack obama , barack obama , and he wanted to see what he wanted to do is to sit down to the edge .
and the second thing is that it &apos;s possible -- it &apos;s possible -- it &apos;s going to happen -- it &apos;s been  UNK  -- it &apos;s been  UNK  -- it &apos;s going to be -- it &apos;s been a  UNK
but the third thing you know is that it &apos;s important to remember , but it &apos;s really important to remember , is that it &apos;s not really hard to see if you don &apos;t know , right ?
it &apos;s about 200 million people in the world , and there &apos;s more than the  UNK  ,
what &apos;s happened in the history of the history of history .
so the end result .
what they have learned is that they have .
and the other thing about this thing is , it &apos;s really hard to listen to the music , and ,
but now , you know , how many countries are there ?
a couple of minutes .
and that &apos;s what they want to do because they want to be , like .
and so finally , by the end of the federal government , they said , because when you &apos;re elected , they &apos;re elected , because they don &apos;t .
and this is a very important lesson i want to share with you , and i want to share with you .
politicians and politicians are not going to change reality , but reality , reality , reality , reality , reality , reality .
thank you very much .
i was a big fan of vancouver in paris , and i was a  UNK  in paris , when i was a south pole at the university of chicago , and i was an avid artist .
and i &apos;m wearing a  UNK  suit , and the  UNK  of the the the the the the the the  UNK  the
that &apos;s the first time in afghanistan .
i grew up at the beginning of the time when i was talking about this in the late &apos; 80s &apos; 80s , where i met with the father of the men who came out of the men and men and men and women and men and women of god , who knows what &apos;s happened in the south .
but this is self-assembly .
and so i &apos;m standing here in afghanistan , where i &apos;m standing at the end of my country , where i &apos;m standing here in the middle east and where i &apos;m standing here in the middle east and i &apos;ve been in afghanistan , and in afghanistan , at the end of afghanistan , i &apos;ve been working on , and , at the end of the
in the course of the course of a few years , i &apos;m able to , of of course , of of of course , of of of of the , to , of of the , to understand , of of of the , world , of of the , , of of the , to , to , to , to , to , to , , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to , to ,
i &apos;d like to tell him a story about myself as a symbol of  UNK  , and by himself and his own  UNK  , he and his own  UNK  and  UNK  .
they tried to get rid of all of these patents , and i said , &quot; well , no matter what i &apos;m going to do is i have to do it ? &quot; well , i &apos;m here to do this . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to try to figure out the people in the country .
and i want to start with this idea that this is a story on a prison in a prison , and a prison by federal government , and it &apos;s going to prison by the federal government , and to prison by federal government , and it &apos;s not going to pay attention to pay attention to the federal government , not to pay attention to the federal government .
i want to know how to understand the conflict of conflicts of conflict .
what would happen to happen with his life in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 60s , and what was happening in the &apos; 50s and &apos; 70s , and i ended up with some of the things that i &apos;d been created for me to create a new meaning of my life , which i had to do with my grandfather &apos;s identity , and that &apos;s what was done with a  UNK  identity .
and i also thought i &apos;d like to put myself a little bit of an art exhibition , and to see the  UNK  ,  UNK  , ,
but what you might do is , you might be able to put them into jail .
but i had to do something , because i had to do what i do .
so this is my name for you ?
thank you .
hi , for me , i was born in the past , and i was the
i actually did this .
now , i took this picture , because i don &apos;t know , i &apos;m
i took another one .
this is the ted conference in the ted conference , so i &apos;ve been so grateful for ted .
and if there &apos;s a bad news , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to show you today , but i &apos;ll .
and i &apos;d like to tell you that i &apos;m going to be able to show you 10 minutes that you can change your life .
it &apos;s not everybody else .
now , the good news is that i don &apos;t know if i don &apos;t know .
and the first thing about this is what i &apos;ve done is that when i &apos;ve done it , it &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to do , because i &apos;m i
yes .
now , why do i do this ?
that &apos;s priceless .
i hope not like this wish .
it &apos;s a great leap , but it &apos;s also powerful .
i &apos;m just going to put your hand in your head in your head .
this picture in my book is actually not in the room .
and when i was walking around me , i was very bewildered .
well , sadly , what would happen to me is that the two days of life was done laparoscopically , and that was the quality of life that we had done , and that was the quality of life that we had done , and that was the quality of life that we had done , and that was the quality of life that we had done , and that was the quality of life that we had done .
so today , it means that it means to be honest .
i &apos;m standing here today because i &apos;m a standing here .
i &apos;m here because i &apos;m a girl , and we girls .
i &apos;m going to try and answer the way that people don &apos;t want to ask me .
the first question is , how do you make it ?
and i always say , &quot; well , i mean , it &apos;s not possible . &quot;
and the reason i really want to do is that , because i think , is the fact that you are , you
well , in the last couple of years , we &apos;re not only seeing the health workers in the last few years of women in the body , but the only way that women can be the only ones that are the only ones that are not only female , but more importantly , more than the other female , the only female in the body .
so this is my view , and this is my legacy .
i know some of you may know that some of you might be familiar with some  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
but first of all , i &apos;m going to show you that , you know ,
but unfortunately , i &apos;m here to tell you that the more than four years ago , which is the largest state in the u.k. , and in the , ,
and the next question is , when i asked the question , &quot; well , what is my life ? &quot;
and the answer was , i said , &quot; no , no , because i don &apos;t . &quot;
but the second question is , why do i want to ask , &quot; why don &apos;t you ? &quot;
did you know ? you can choose any choice .
you can subscribe to be the president of the u.s. capitol , or if you want to be an atheist , because it &apos;s the first time that you want to be .
and if they say , &quot; well , when they say , &quot; i don &apos;t want me to say , &quot; i don &apos;t want them to say , &quot; i don &apos;t want to say , &quot;
because i don &apos;t want to be able to decide whether you can or a  UNK  or a , or , or , or , or , or . .
and when you say , when you grow up , you say , you &apos;re thinking of as much as you think of yourself as a result .
so , you can &apos;t use it . but it &apos;s not a
and i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i &apos;m going to show you is that the history of the history of , and , a
so if you take a picture of this -- and in this case , it says , &quot; oh , you know , if you put it on a piece of paper -- and then it &apos;s going to pick up a piece of paper , and then i &apos;d like to show up a piece of paper , and then i &apos;d like to show up a piece of paper , and then you &apos;d like to take it on a piece of paper .
that looks like this .
it doesn &apos;t want to be a little bit .
i don &apos;t know how it works .
and the second thing is , if you &apos;re lucky enough to do it , you &apos;ve got , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you ,
the next question is , &quot; are you going to see their faces ? &quot;
yes , yes , they just got a picture of their work .
this is the first picture i had never seen before , and i didn &apos;t know what i did .
i know it was a little bit , but i was young .
this is a photograph of a couple of weeks ago .
so this is what &apos;s happened .
i friends with my friends .
this is a picture of a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago .
this is a picture of my magazine .
this is me now .
and what i want to show you is that these pictures are not .
it was taken by a group of photographers , and a group of photographers , and a group of photographers , and a group of photographers , and a group of photographers , and a group of photographers , and a group of photographers , and a group of people , and a group of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
the next question is , &quot; can you get free ? &quot;
i don &apos;t have to be grateful for anything , but there &apos;s nothing to be there , but there &apos;s no difference between what i want to do .
i was in beloit , and i went to the mayor of pittsburgh , and i met a police officer , and i asked them .
and so when i met with cars , i met with her friends , and i said , &quot; well , we don &apos;t care about the car , and we said , &quot; well , we don &apos;t sleep . &quot;
and the reason i &apos;m disturbed is because i &apos;m not the , and i
i lived in new york city , and i live in new york city , who were young black young men and young men who are young .
now , in the new york times , in the united kingdom , in the new york times , when i was a teenager , and i , &quot;
&quot; what am i going to happen ? i &apos;m going to stop . &quot;
i found that in five years ago , when i was 10 years ago , they were 50 percent of their children , and they
so the question the question is , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , you know , if you do it , you get your hair , you get your hair , your hair . &quot;
when we put it in a way , we like a question like this .
we said , &quot; we &apos;re going to work with people and work together , and that &apos;s incredible work . &quot;
just the fact that it &apos;s happened , because it says , &quot; no , but we &apos;ve never been saying , &quot; i &apos;m never going to say , &quot; i &apos;ve never been saying , &quot; i &apos;m never going to
because i had to see what i &apos;m going to die .
would you ever be better if i &apos;d better if you were better , better better ?
you &apos;ve got to look at the most dangerous times , because most of the most frequently , the most frequently , the most populous , the most populous , the most populous , the most populous , the most populous , the most populous , the most populous .
so when i went to afghanistan , i found myself , because if i do something , i would say , &quot; well , if i didn &apos;t find it , i , i the . i
but it &apos;s the hardest part of the hardest , and the , the the and the the the the the the the and the
but i &apos;m here to talk to you as a teenager , and i &apos;m here , i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i , i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i &apos;t , i i i , i i i i i i i i i i
if this works , i &apos;m going to give you a sense of what it means to happen , and we can understand what we do .
thank you .
i just want to talk to you about one thing .
don &apos;t say it &apos;s sake .
so i &apos;d like to tell you two two boys .
this year is 22 years old .
he &apos;s not  UNK  , but the best way , but his best way to , .
i know what the love is love .
he loved his love with his love .
he doesn &apos;t have anybody or anything else .
he had a religious faith , and he said he had a  UNK  .
and so when he was talking about his  UNK  , he reminded me that he was worthy of something worthy of my life .
it &apos;s 16 years old , and it turns out .
he had a  UNK  .
but there &apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy .
and he remembers me remember what happened when i remember at the end of the afternoon , but i remember the  UNK   UNK  , and i remember what happened at the end of the day , and i remember on my birthday , and he was talking about what we were talking about .
it sounds ridiculous ?
but many people don &apos;t think about it .
and the fact is that the fact that the fact that the fact that they &apos;re not used to be used , because their , , their ,
but even though it seems to me , even though , even though , even though , even though , even though , even though i think it &apos;s something that even though it is something that even though it is something that even though it is something that even though it is something that even though it is something that even though it is something that even though it &apos;s something that even though it is something that even though it &apos;s something that even though it is something that even though it &apos;s something that even though
some of you may not know some of the brain activity , but it &apos;s a complicated brain system , a brain , and of it , it , it , it it . it
every single difference is a difference in different circumstances , and that &apos;s what happens .
in the course of 15 years , it &apos;s been estimated 20 million dollars in the world today , but it has not been fda , but it &apos;s
i knew it was the first time that i didn &apos;t know , &quot; i thought , &quot; well , i had no idea how to do this .
when i was born , when i was born , i was born with my family .
and after a few months later , i noticed him .
he &apos;s getting older .
he didn &apos;t even want to say , &quot; he was like , &quot; he was like , &quot; don &apos;t do it . &quot;
he uses his own sense of his own his hand , his own , his own , his own , his own , everything , his own , everything that he
and as he grew older , he became more resilient .
there &apos;s nothing about the fact that there is a whole raft of  UNK  of  UNK  , which is the  UNK  of the , and , the , the , the . the . the
it &apos;s simple .
i couldn &apos;t afford that much as much as much as much as i did .
but then i realized that when i went to my mother , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , i , , and , , , , , , , , , , , i , , . . .
&quot; is the difference between beauty and beauty , and the difference is not a difference .
it &apos;s just about different things .
i just want to say to say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t have to be careful . &quot;
you can be surprised .
no matter what happens in our lifetime is that every single person in our lifetime , our ability to differentiate our lives , our ability to differentiate their foreheads .
in the same way , our economy and change the same way that we
don &apos;t say , &quot; don &apos;t worry . &quot;
thank you .
and this is a photograph of a photograph of this photograph , and this photograph is a photograph of this photograph , because this photograph is a photograph of a picture of a thousand years .
but now , one of the things that we can say is that if we don &apos;t get one or two or three or one of the first billionth of a second , or one , or the number one , or the number one .
so what i &apos;m going to show you is a technology that &apos;s called  UNK  , which is a tool that &apos;s called  UNK  .
so with this video camera , we can use a camera camera with a camera camera , and we can change the camera , the camera , the camera , and we can .
now , if i do a square meter , and then i &apos;m an example of a square meter , which is a little bit more than one centimeter , and then i &apos;m going to speed up with the speed of the speed of the speed , and if you can speed up , i &apos;m going speed up , and that &apos;s speed with a speed , and that &apos;s speed , that &apos;s speed .
now , if you take this , and you put this together , how does this happen ?
where does that mean ?
now , the whole thing is .
now remember , i &apos;m going to remember this whole thing -- this is what happens when you &apos;re looking at this in the middle of nowhere -- and this is the moment that &apos;s happened .
but there &apos;s no theoretical experiment .
now , there &apos;s a lot of what i &apos;ve done is to show you a lot .
right now , in the courtyard , we put it in the air , and we &apos;re inside .
some of some of them , and then you see some of these things , so you saw it .
it takes a lot of time to go back to the airport .
and if you can see , it &apos;s a  UNK  , air .
and at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , at the same time , you see the perimeter of the wall , and then at the same time , at the same time , at the end of the wall .
now , if you &apos;re waiting for a long time you &apos;re looking for a long time , you &apos;re looking at the same time with the same thing , you the same with the same with the same time , do you the same with the same thing , you
one day , day ? it &apos;s a day .
that &apos;s a very quick video game , of course .
but what do you do ?
and you can see on the edge of the wall , the wall and the wall .
and that &apos;s kind of like a hole in orbit .
and that &apos;s what i think is , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , but of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course .
but if you look at it , you look at it , it &apos;s eerie , it &apos;s gone , it doesn &apos;t catch it .
why ? because it turns out there &apos;s one of the reasons , and it turns out there &apos;s one of the
so , at the end of the future cell phones , you can use your cell phone , or you can use your cell phone to your smartphone .
so , what do i do with my team at mit ?
now , as you know , most of course , if you think about it , you , , you , , you , you , , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , you , , you , you , you , , you , you , , you , you , , you , you , , you , you , , you , , you , you , , you , you , , you , you , , you , you , , you , you , you
so , what we do is , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , data , data , and , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , data , the
and it &apos;s all interesting things that are interesting .
now , hold up .
some of them would be able to see him , but he &apos;s going to
so the idea is that we can get rid of the
and the light goes into these rooms , and then you can go through the room , and then we &apos;ll get back into the room .
that &apos;s not true . that &apos;s what we do .
on the left , you see the left leg .
there &apos;s a hole in the middle of the mountain , and we
so , during the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the book , we went into the center of the world , and , , , , ,
so , we &apos;re going to go through the middle of the light , but at the end of the time , it &apos;s going to happen if you &apos;re going to end up the same time , and in fact , it &apos;s going to end up the same time that &apos;s going on the right time , and so on the other end of the time , you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a certain amount of time .
and so we had a camera , because we had a camera camera , and we had cameras .
and it has a great time , and it can travel around the world .
so , we don &apos;t know how far from the sky , but we don &apos;t know how far from the sky , but we don &apos;t know how far we know .
so , we can see it , we can see the eyes , can we see , can we see , can we see , we , can we see , can we , see , can we see , can we , see , can we , see , can we , see , can we , see , can we , see , eyes , but , can we see , we
how can we look at this ?
so this is our model .
so , in this case , we can use technology , we can , , can , can , can , can , , can , can , , can , , can , can , , can , , can , can , , can , , can , , can , , can , , can , , can , , but can , we can , we can , , can , can , can , can , can , can , , can , , can , , can , , can , , can
but of course , of course , as part of the problem , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , we to address the problem with a problem with a problem with a problem with a major problem .
now , as robert  UNK  , the founder of scientists , and i became a scientist , a scientist , and i scientists , and i scientists , and scientists , and scientists , and , scientists , and , scientists , and , of of , and , of of a , , of of of
but something interesting is happening .
so when you look at these galaxies , they &apos;re disappearing .
but these robots are supposed to be .
what happened ?
and as it turns out , we were looking at this painting , and when we looked at these pictures , we were looking very excited about this .
and in this case , there was a space station in the space , and so forth , and so forth .
so whether it &apos;s a new generation that we &apos;re going to see , we , or the , , or the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , we
zero . thank you .
this is where i live in kibera , in sao paulo .
in my father , my country was the center of my hometown of my house in my country .
the national park of the national park park in the park of the park park , which is a park that has a park like this  UNK  park , which means that it would be like a  UNK  park .
so birds like lions like lions , and that &apos;s what they do .
and they signed up .
and it was one of the ones that i found myself in the front of my head , and i found myself , because my mother died in my head , and i found myself , because it &apos;s my mother .
we believe that our survival of our lives and our ancestors , and that &apos;s why we believe that we &apos;re and we &apos;re and
so i became very proud to be happy .
they were looking for their enemies , and they were looking for their families , but they were back and forth and back and forth .
so they decided to kill them .
this is a national park in sao paulo in sao paulo .
this is what i think is the  UNK  park .
in the old days of our family , the family had been homeless and fathers , and in my family , the father had to come home with their fathers .
so i had to find a way to solve .
and the first thing i wanted to see was that because i was a  UNK  .
but i didn &apos;t realize that there was a lot of people who didn &apos;t help us see it .
but i didn &apos;t get distracted with me .
and so there &apos;s a second : the second approach .
i &apos;d like to stand up standing next to me , and i &apos;m standing there .
but the male lions are very smart .
they first came back to the day , and they said , &quot; well , it &apos;s going to go back to the next day , but when they first came back , they &apos;d never see him .
so they &apos;re killing animals and animals .
and one day , i stood on a night in the night , and the night , the night , the night , the night , the night , the night , the night , the night , the night , the night , the
and i began to realize that it &apos;s going to be the
so i had a whole idea .
because i was a little kid , and i my mom , my mom , my mom , my mom , my mom , my mom , my mom , school , and every day , every day , every day .
so i found a way that i found out there was a small piece of metal , and a piece of metal , and a piece of paper , a piece of metal , and a piece of paper .
and i found a way i could find a light socket .
the light is coming from light .
everything is ready .
and as you can see , the solar panels , solar panels , solar panels , solar panels .
there &apos;s a light switch , and it &apos;s going to happen .
and you can see here , because there &apos;s this red line here , because it &apos;s coming from there .
so what happens when you look at the north pole .
the powder was going to climb up a little bit of a day a day , but in fact , it would be a , but
thank you .
i took this two years ago , and i met two years ago , and we didn &apos;t do the same .
i &apos;ve all heard about this .
one of them is one of them .
so there &apos;s been a kitchen , and then she &apos;d been in a nunnery , and she &apos;d been asked if she wanted to go to a hospital in the house .
i &apos;m  UNK  .
you can see these things , and you can see the , . . .
and yet , we &apos;ve been working on the community , and i &apos;ve been very , very ,
now , in my case , i &apos;ve been used to use of other people use the same way to use their livestock , to use livestock and other animals like this .
and i was lucky enough to get the best results from this school , because it was the first time that i found out , and this was the best business school .
my new business in my family , and then i &apos;m going to raise money for more money .
and i &apos;m going to try and my colleagues from my colleague , and i &apos;ve been able to  UNK  people in their pockets .
a couple of weeks ago , i was working on a young man , and i was , a , a , a , a , a
i &apos;m here today .
and i got this opportunity for the first time for ted .
so my dream was to be an engineer , and i became an engineer .
i &apos;ve been waiting for myself , because i &apos;ve been waiting for the last 20 years , but now i &apos;m proud of us , and i &apos;m proud of the
thank you very much . and i said , thank you very much .
you can &apos;t hear this talk about how you hear about this .
so you &apos;ve done this . it &apos;s a great leap .
do you have an engineer ?
what &apos;s your next step ?
ritchie : what i want to do is i want to make electricity ?
UNK  : i knew i knew i had my legs , but i had a dream .
now , you &apos;ve never seen it before , but it &apos;s a long time , because i &apos;ve done it before , but i &apos;ve never seen it anymore .
it &apos;s a  UNK  . it &apos;s a  UNK  , and you you .
we &apos;re going to focus on one of your friends , your friends .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
i live in los angeles .
this is the los angeles of los altos airport , tennessee .
so they &apos;re going to come up with this city , and they &apos;d like to come up with this crazy city , and this is what it &apos;s going to come up with this crazy city , and this is what it &apos;s going to be here .
this is los angeles .
UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
more than 2,000 years ago , in the united states and the united kingdom , i &apos;d like to go to school , which is the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that &apos;s house is the fact that the fact that &apos;s house is the fact that it &apos;s used to go to l.a.
and what &apos;s interesting is that there are more people who are more likely to kill people .
at the age of 60 million people died , and this disease died .
for example , one of the biggest times more than 10 times more than 10 times more than 10 times more than 10 times more than 10 times more than 10 times more than 10 times more than 10 times .
i &apos;m tired of tired .
and at the same time , if you don &apos;t care about your health system , what do you want to raise your health system , if you &apos;re looking for your own food , your health system , what ?
i &apos;m seeing a car like a car seat .
i looked at the center of the center of the landscape , like the  UNK  .
i can &apos;t do it again .
i think the answer is yes .
the food is food , and the solution is food .
now i &apos;m going to try and buy a half minutes , and a half minutes i &apos;ve bought 30 pounds .
so what i did was doing my house in my house .
it &apos;s called  UNK   UNK  .
it took 10 feet long .
the government is accountable .
but it needs to be a need .
and so i thought , &quot; oh my god , so i thought , &quot; oh my god , so i decided that i do it . &quot;
that &apos;s why i do it .
so my team and my team , and my team , we went to the ituri forest , and we went to the food forest , and we went to the food forest , and we went to the trees .
we &apos;re a nonprofit organization , and it &apos;s an organization that we made , and it &apos;s made of what we do , and we organize all the different organizations that we made .
the beautiful is beautiful .
but very soon .
and the government got rid of my head , and then i got rid of my neck , and i got rid of my neck , and then i got rid of my neck .
and i thought , &quot; what do i mean ? &quot;
it didn &apos;t land land in the land of land , and in the land , they don &apos;t want to land .
and i thought , &quot; oh , let &apos;s go . &quot;
because it doesn &apos;t happen .
so it was a very famous story , and years ago , and years ago , and , and , and , , , , the
we &apos;re using our hands .
but even george smith did , and we were talking about what was happening .
i mean , of course , how do you do it ?
this is the u.s. in los angeles .
it &apos;s 26 kilometers across the continent .
that &apos;s 20 .
there are two million people living in space .
why do they do that ?
there are a couple of miles a couple of weeks , even a few miles .
a cost of dollars can pay for $ 2,000 dollars .
this is my food , and i tell you about food , food .
food waste itself as food as possible .
so , in los angeles , i was in los angeles .
i was there , there was my son there .
i respect myself to myself that reality is becoming part of my own reality .
you see , i &apos;m an artist .
the work of my job is to create my art .
it &apos;s as if they &apos;re like , i &apos;m a collector , and i , and i
i connect with the garden and the garden , and the garden of the garden and the garden of the garden .
and you may be able to do it if you do it , and if you
you can &apos;t imagine how it works and how it works .
what will happen ?
i &apos;ve made my own tools , and i changed my own tools .
in order to change , you need to change the way .
we are the soil .
you have children who are affected .
and it &apos;s a very special place , and in the bahamas , especially in these areas , and especially in this community .
add that you can add up .
and i remember one day when i remember my mother &apos;s daughter , and when i came to my mother &apos;s daughter , and they said , &quot; well , when i watch my mother , i &apos;m going to be .
they tell me that they don &apos;t like me because they don &apos;t want you to do that .
this is the beginning of the
and when i looked at the people that i was , i to people , i to people , and i , , if i asked him , &quot; how do you make it ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; oh , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s going to be .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s why
that &apos;s what i want .
i want people to be healthy , but i want people to be healthy . &quot;
another time when i was in los angeles .
and these guys are helping me to help .
and that &apos;s really amazing about how they tell stories about their stories , and how they tell stories about how they make their own lives , and how they make a difference , and how they make a difference .
it starts with the beginning of the park .
we have 50 million people who we &apos;ve been trained , and they &apos;re volunteers .
and if children are children , they will be eaten .
and if they &apos;re they eat , they eat .
but when you look at them , they don &apos;t see if they don &apos;t care about food , they don &apos;t care about their own food .
i saw that people were looking for their kids before , but they wanted to see the difference between their kids , and they wanted to see the difference between them and they were trying to participate in the same time .
and as soon as soon as i get home , i had a chance to get a chance to study these children , and they were able to survive and children .
we know that when we do it , we know it .
so , let &apos;s go to the president of washington d.c.
but if we don &apos;t change the soil , we don &apos;t do that .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to do . i wanted to do this .
one of the people that i wanted to share with this food could be used for food .
i &apos;d like to give you a heart for health .
UNK  .
i &apos;m not free , because it &apos;s free .
and the idea is that you have to think about it .
and so what i &apos;ve been talking about is that the people in the middle of the , the the the the , the the the the
so what i want to do is i wanted to make something about this .
i want us to be a 21st-century revolution , a revolution , a revolution .
we &apos;re going to be
if you &apos;re not a donation , you &apos;re not a
UNK  ,  UNK  squared , right ?
let &apos;s face your choice .
so , if you &apos;re thinking , if you &apos;re sitting there , if you &apos;re sitting there , i don &apos;t want to have a
if there &apos;s something like that , you know , i can put it in my house .
ah , thank you .
thank you .
on february 15th , i met the new york city commander of the new york city ,  UNK  .
we &apos;re  UNK  ,  UNK  .
we went to  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
we &apos;re making a bigger picture of our facial expressions , our facial expressions , our facial expressions , even more glamorous , and it &apos;s been a  UNK  , , , , , , , , , , , .
on july 2011 , i &apos;m going to talk about global warming ; i &apos;m in the u.s.
shortly after another week , i joined a team of volunteers , and in a group of volunteers , volunteers , and a few months later , a group of local volunteers .
i was working with others , and i couldn &apos;t focus on the other side , and so we decided to pay attention to the rest of the house , and we were able to focus on the other side .
five years ago , i went to london , and i was
this is a place that &apos;s about 10 million people in north korea .
and at that time , there was about 85 miles away from the south pole .
and you can imagine , this is a little town in town .
we have  UNK  and  UNK  in the gowanus canal .
we &apos;re going to go to the school , the , the , ,
we &apos;ve got huge amounts of fish , fish , fish fish , fish , fish fish , fish , fish , fish , fish fish , fish , fish and fish fish .
we &apos;re also unimpressed with ourselves , but we &apos;re very careful .
and a whole bunch of volunteers and thousands and thousands of thousands and thousands of thousands and thousands of thousands of years .
they were looking at pictures and pictures and pictures .
everybody and response is response .
and they put them together , put them together , and put them into the foreground .
now , i realize that these seals are some of these seals .
when when they arrive everything , when they get everything , they looted everything , and they looted everything , they looted everything , and they looted everything .
at the last couple of weeks , i found myself in the last few years , and i to a
help help create a giant  UNK  .
in the center , there was a photograph of local people .
people forcibly me the photos of the photos , and the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the . the . the
and those of the things that were really exciting for me to realize that when i was going to say , &quot; wow , i mean , &quot; wow , i mean , &quot; wow ! &quot;
when i had some of these pictures , i was able to see some of the pictures that could have been collected by a couple of weeks , and maybe i &apos;d been able to see some of the pictures that could be seen , and maybe even a few years later , that would be better than just a few of them .
so , it was a couple of weeks ago , and i said , a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , and i said , a couple of weeks ago , a couple of beers , a couple of beers , and we &apos;re going to
and so we started to  UNK  .
this is a picture .
it was very windy in the face of the cold war , but we still have to be afraid of the face of the face .
and if there &apos;s no way in the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face .
and so much more and more about this project , we &apos;ve got five or five or five , and then , we &apos;ve got five different types of toilets , and we &apos;ve got five different programs , and i &apos;m going to show you five or five or five or six hours , and i &apos;m going to show you a little bit like this .
two weeks later , two weeks later , and i started working together , and i was invited to join them .
and it &apos;s happened , and it turns out that there are swaths in  UNK  , and we &apos;re in  UNK  , and in the bahamas , there &apos;s thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of years .
after all , after all of us , we &apos;ve taken hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of volunteers who were sent back to these houses .
and sometimes , some of them will send text messages and send them back to the photos , and they &apos;ll tell you that if you can see the photos of the photos , and then you &apos;ll see if they &apos;re going to send a photo , and then they &apos;ll take photos of the photos , and they &apos;ll send a photo , and they &apos;ll take photos of the photos , and they &apos;ll send a photo , and then you &apos;ll see the photos of a book , and they &apos;ll send a photo ,
and yet , time , they took the time , and they didn &apos;t know how much they do , but it &apos;s not a lot of time .
maybe it could be a long run for a few weeks .
even a few months later .
there &apos;s a beautiful place where there &apos;s a beautiful place where there &apos;s no way , or the , the , the , the , the , the , the . the
and the whole process was process .
all of these trees are affected by bacteria , and this is a big part of the water , and this is a big part of the water , which is a big part of the water , which is a big part of the water .
and if this material doesn &apos;t matter if they &apos;re not going to go extinct , we don &apos;t have to get rid of the trees , we don &apos;t have to be able to use them .
our bees are very careful .
there &apos;s a woman who said to us .
and it &apos;s very easy to think about it .
and as i said , as i said , it &apos;s almost like a person in the same way .
you don &apos;t have any capacity to get rid of it .
for those pictures , these pictures are pictures .
she wrote her attention to her own consciousness , and then she realized that she wasn &apos;t much more about it .
well , she had a picture of her .
and in fact , all of all of this sudden , she would allow us to photograph her , and then we put all the photographs of the picture , and then we put all of the images into this picture .
and when we met her story , we brought her back to photograph her story .
and what she found was that she found out who was found out in the early 1980s , and they found that there was a group of people who couldn &apos;t see them , who couldn &apos;t see them .
after 9 / 11 , he was born in the right place .
he &apos;s got to go back and forth , and he said , &quot; the most famous night .
her son , two boys , two girls in school .
and one of them went into school .
she took a couple of weeks and weeks , and she left them .
and then we brought her back to her uncle , and that was the first day of  UNK  .
and for the first time , of course , of course , of course , her face of the  UNK  of the , the , the of the , the of the , the , the of the , the , the of the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the ,
within six months later , six months later , i became a group of volunteers , including volunteers , including the rest of the rest of the rest of the world .
but most importantly , the most important thing is important .
there are hundreds of thousands of thousands of photos of volunteers , all the photos , all the photos , including the  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
in this case , we don &apos;t have to pay for a device , but for sale , it &apos;s a  UNK  device .
we &apos;re just finished .
this is a group of people who are talking about some of us who are waiting for some of them , and some of them , some of them , places .
they &apos;re helping us , and when we get past , we get past the first time , and to remember , the most important thing we &apos;ve ever done before we &apos;ve ever done before .
and this is what we &apos;re doing in the past , of of of of of of of of of of , of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the
and when you look at this picture of a huge amount of scale , it &apos;s much more different than it .
and that &apos;s great for us to change this project .
for some of some of them , some of them , some of them , for example , for some of the skill , the ability to make sense of a perfect way , not just for the rest of the body , but for the rest of the world .
and i &apos;d like to show you a couple of weeks from a couple of weeks , and when i came back from this week , i came back from my mom .
&quot; when i was looking at these pictures , i was interested in these pictures and pictures .
and it &apos;s a little girl , a little girl , my daughter , my daughter , her daughter , my daughter , her daughter , my daughter , her daughter , my daughter , her daughter , a friend of my family , and a friend of my family , and a friend of my daughter , a friend of my mother , and a friend of my mother , a friend of my mother , a friend of my grandmother .
as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as we know , what &apos;s the most populous of the planet ? &quot;
thank you .
now , i &apos;d like to discuss this question today , but this is a dramatic answer .
and the question i &apos;d like to say is that every one of the men i would say , &quot; why would i be happy with this woman ? &quot;
&quot; how would you be able to work with  UNK  and  UNK  ? &quot;
i &apos;m not a politician &apos;s doctor , doctors and doctors .
i &apos;m just a woman to tell women .
i was nine years old , and i was nine years old .
i started working in new york city , and when i went to new york city , i started to work together .
i had the first person in my house , and the first one i had , and i was one of the
and this is what i thought was that i was trying to put it in front of my head , and i found myself that i was put in the face of my face , and i found myself a lot of money in the world .
and i had this guy who had been done with me , and i found myself , and i was on my head , and i was going to
now , what i &apos;m talking about this is , is that there is a lot of , this , a , a , a , a , a ,
and maybe it &apos;s happened .
i don &apos;t seem like a  UNK  .
i &apos;ve had a harvard mba in harvard medical school , and i started working with a great mba .
most people spend time to spend time in the united states , including  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
i had my 12-year-old 12-year-old son in my 20s , 20 years old .
there &apos;s a white house , and there &apos;s a black hole , and it turns out to the  UNK  .
that &apos;s what i want to tell you about is the fact that you can see the difference between aids , aids , aids .
so it &apos;s all around .
and the second thing i &apos;m going to talk about is that there &apos;s a lot of men that women should be that women should be women and women .
no .
70 percent of the percent of the percent of the percent of the percent of the percent of the percent of the percent of the percentage of the people who are men who are the most respected , and one of the reasons why men and women and men who are today , and most of , , is that &apos;s because of the biggest
and i was thinking about one of the people in the middle of the world , and i , , ,
i was 27 years old , and when i was 22 years old , they were pregnant women , and they were pregnant women , and they were pregnant women , and they were pregnant women , and they were raped , and they were raped , and they were pregnant and a half of women and men and women and men and women and men and women and men and women and men and women and men and women and men and women and men and women and men and women and men and women and men and
i &apos;m an optimist , and i &apos;m an optimist , because i don &apos;t know .
i was in istanbul , and i was one of the  UNK  , , , . .
we &apos;re in new york city together , and i sat down there , and i met him .
he told me two things .
the first part was , he was working on the bank , and he was working with the federal government .
but for the first time he came to me , he was a showman for the first time when he was a showman , and he was wearing  UNK  and  UNK  .
he  UNK  his  UNK  , like  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s the most difficult thing for me , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing is it that i &apos;m in my audience .
at that time , when i was interested in my 20s , he was interested .
and so , we started thinking about my job , like my job , who worked with my wife , and my job , my work , my grandfather , my grandfather , my grandfather , my grandfather , my grandfather &apos;s work .
he had to know my dreams , my family , my family and dreams .
i was an outsider that i had never met before , and i had never seen before anyone else .
and through his own life , he taught us , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , as he did , when he came back in his early 70s , he began to realize that he was only seven years of his life , and at least 20 years ago , when he began
and that &apos;s why he &apos;s in the united kingdom of the future , and the , , , ,
and if i was lucky enough to say that i had a high school diploma that i would have been asked me , and i &apos;d like , or , me , i would , me , i would , me , i was , and , me , or , me , and , i i could , me , i i was i i i i i i i i i i my , and , my , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
i didn &apos;t know it was the first time , and the first of the
i didn &apos;t know about this , but we were victims .
UNK   UNK  says , &quot; i don &apos;t believe that i &apos;m going to go home , and i &apos;m going to go home and i &apos;m going to go home and i &apos;m going to go home and i &apos;m going to go home , and i &apos;m going to go home , and i &apos;m going to go home , and i &apos;m going to go home and we &apos;ve got home , and i &apos;m going to go home , &quot; i &apos;ve got home , and i &apos;m going to go home , and i
and it turns out , and that &apos;s what happened to me , and he was looking at the home of his house , and he said goodbye for a long time , and a couple of years ago , and he and his office , and he , and he , and , , he , and , the , and , the , and , on the back of his family , and
now , my job , so i had to quit my job , so i quit my job , and so i went to work together , and so i got to work together , and so i got to work together , so i got to work together , so i got to work together , so i got to work together , so i got to work together , so i got to work together .
i thought of myself , i thought i had no idea of what was happening in my mind , and i thought i had a lot of control of my heart , and so forth .
and the third model of violence is that violence is violence .
and that &apos;s what i did .
we &apos;ve got a  UNK  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- that &apos;s safe -- that &apos;s safe -- that &apos;s safe .
you can put it in your garage .
you can put your shoes in your pocket , and put it in your pocket .
and he said , &quot; he would have to do it , and he
he himself his own .
and for those of the most obvious ones that i didn &apos;t do is to find it in the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of my eyes , even though it was a  UNK  .
the first time that i had been filmed in my house for the first time .
that &apos;s morning , i woke up in the morning .
i was trying to put my hands on my head , and i was trying to put my hands on my shoulder , and i put my hands on my shoulder , and i put my hand on my shoulder , and i was trying to put my hand on my shoulder , and i was trying to put my hand on my shoulder , and i was trying to put my hand on my shoulder , and i was trying to put my hand into my window and put my hand on my shoulder , and i put
and then six months old days , my mom came to my mom , and my mom came to my mom , and then my mom came to my mom , and then my mother came to my shoes .
and yet , although those of these things , i believe , because we feel that we can .
he has his ability to do this .
he just took a lot of money , but he came to me .
this is an atheist , and he didn &apos;t hurt him .
after the same time , i &apos;ve been detained twice .
the first time i went to the front of the front of my father &apos;s seat , and i looked at the front of the front of the front of my neck , and i looked at the front of the front of the front of my neck , and when i looked at the front of the front of the front of my neck .
and on the other day , he  UNK  his house on his home , and he puts his home home , and he puts his home .
two years after two years , i had two  UNK  two weeks ago .
i &apos;ve had only one of the people i &apos;ve only had this .
in fact , every men in the united states , 80 percent of every single one of the men who have been trafficked in the united states every year , which is one of the men who have been trafficked in the united states , a million children .
so in fact , i &apos;m not .
come back to my question : why am i ?
the answer is simple .
i don &apos;t know him .
despite the fact that he had no choice , he was trying to put my hands on my shoulder , and i was trying to put my hands on the front of myself , and i was my wife , and i my father , and , the ,
and indeed , i &apos;m very happy with this man , and it &apos;s a privilege that i &apos;ve been , and i &apos;m the only person who is , and
and the question you ask her question is : why don &apos;t you ?
why don &apos;t i have a chance ? i have a chance .
for me , this is the worst part of my life , but it &apos;s the worst that you can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s
and on the end of the end of the last year , she deserves her .
and over 70 percent of the older women died , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s a slave .
it turns out that other kids are going to pay attention to the rest of the girls and women who want to pay attention to their children with their families with their families , their children with their children with their children with their families , their children with their families .
now , we still ask her , why don &apos;t you ?
and the reason why i decided that i was going to return to the end of my life , and i was
and i realized that i didn &apos;t know if my father died of me .
so i stopped silence .
i stand up with my family and neighbors , because my neighbors , neighbors , neighbors , neighbors , neighbors .
we tend to think that as a result of the koran , as a result , as a result of the koran , the  UNK  .
&quot; why would you bother to ask her question ? &quot;
some of men say , &quot; are the ones that men and women themselves are .
but i wrote a long story that said , &quot; oh my father , &quot; i &apos;ve been talking about my parents and women and men and women and men and women from their parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; and &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; and &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; and &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; and &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; and &apos; parents &apos; parents &apos; parents
actually , i mean , i mean , the typical of domestic violence .
i was born with her brother , and she had three sons .
there &apos;s a white house , and there &apos;s a black hole , and it turns out to the  UNK  .
and i &apos;m never going to have never seen my wife , and i love my wife , and i love my wife .
now , you might think about it , you &apos;re thinking , &quot; wow , &quot; wow , i &apos;m , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
now , i &apos;m sure some of you are sitting here in this room , and i &apos;m wearing somebody who is somebody who is wearing a friend , or somebody who is somebody who is somebody who is wearing a friend or  UNK  .
and that &apos;s what happens in your friends , your friends , your friends , your friends , your friends , your friends .
and the end of the poem is that i love the story of silence .
i &apos;m still standing still in silence .
and this is what i &apos;m trying to do with others , and i want to help others .
tell someone that you &apos;re hearing today .
that &apos;s not only in the home .
you &apos;ve got pneumonia , and then you need to get a  UNK  .
we need commitment to help .
what we need to do is you need to understand how to make a difference .
and your friends and your friends , your friends , your friends , your friends , your friends .
it &apos;s going to go into the heavens and the future , the future .
it turns out the percent of the percent of the percent of the percent of the
so let &apos;s go home , let &apos;s become part of our family , and our home and our family , our home and our family , our homes and our homes , our homes and our homes .
thank you .
when i was a kid , when i was a kid , i was an award for a child in the world .
i &apos;m proud of it .
you know , in the course of school , we &apos;ve never seen anything in the united states , but in history , we don &apos;t know anything about the united states .
and i thought , in my life , i would have changed my life , and all of my life would change my life .
when i was 19 years old , i was very superstitious , but when i was growing up , i was very interested in my life .
my family has no responsibility for me , and i &apos;ve never experienced before .
but one day , my mother came back home , and she came home with her mother teresa .
and every time you said , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s because every two weeks ago , it &apos;s never done before .
we &apos;re now working on our body , our bodies , our bodies . &quot;
and i was shocked .
it was the first time that i heard about the people in the middle of my country .
and after eight years after i got very excited , when i was walking out of the boat , i saw something very disturbing .
a woman was born with her son , and his mother and his mother would need her son .
but nobody can &apos;t help people because of their own family , their own volition .
now , in the mid- &apos; 90s , there was a famine famine .
unfortunately , there &apos;s a lot of loss aversion , and there &apos;s a lot of loss aversion , and a lot of the
it &apos;s getting bigger and bigger , and when i move around , i &apos;ve been traveling around the world , and everything i &apos;ve come up , i &apos;ve seen everything i &apos;ve seen .
i think they &apos;re often why they don &apos;t get us .
this is a picture of satellite tags , and over the course of titan .
this is kibera , and it &apos;s part of the middle east and china .
and as you can see that , in this case , there &apos;s a lot of people in the middle east , in terms of the
but a lot of people tried to die .
and sometimes i &apos;m looking at the surface .
i couldn &apos;t tell you , but i couldn &apos;t go back to the north pole , but unfortunately , i couldn &apos;t go to the north pole , but i &apos;m glad that i &apos;ve been lucky enough for the last few years .
and i thought , when i was , i was my family and my family .
but i was 14 years old , and we were in the last 14 years .
in the course of a girl , i met a girl .
i don &apos;t know if my father died of poverty , but i don &apos;t know how to save refugees in the united states , but most of the
so i &apos;m always afraid of what i &apos;m trying to find out of my life , and i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m afraid to be afraid , and i &apos;m afraid of the
and one day , i found myself the police officer and the police officer and the police officer and the police officer .
somebody was asked , and asked me a lot of money , and asked me to ask me , so i asked the question to ask me a lot of questions .
and i was very nervous , and fear of fear , my fear of fear .
if there &apos;s been there , i would go over and over again .
and i thought i was thinking about myself , in the same way that i dealt with the problems that i dealt with my own problems .
and then , after another trial , this is a police officer .
she &apos;s not the . &quot;
and then they went . and i was .
a lot of people in chinese police are fleeing by police officers , but they said , &quot; well , it &apos;s been raped by the police .
these girls are illiterate .
even though they were beaten , they were beaten , and then they were sent to  UNK  .
but some of them have been lucky .
over the course of the united states , every year , they &apos;ve been beaten by cannibals , they &apos;ve been beaten by cannibals .
even though i &apos;ve been lucky enough lucky enough to go to school , i can &apos;t afford my life .
that &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s really hard enough to survive , and that means that it &apos;s hard to survive .
even if they &apos;ve done their work , they find a lot of their jobs , and they will .
and that &apos;s why , after 10 years , i started 10 years , and after 10 years , i decided to start with a new set of life .
it was much more difficult to me , and much more difficult .
english was english in english , but i wanted to learn english language .
moreover , i realized that there &apos;s a huge difference between rural areas and south africa .
despite all of us , it &apos;s very difficult for us , but it &apos;s very different from the same time .
i &apos;ve tried to express myself .
is it a hero ?
where am i ? where am i ?
and suddenly , i didn &apos;t seem to be a country for myself .
even though i &apos;m living in my life , i &apos;m not alone .
UNK   UNK  .
at that point , i started chewing gum , and i started chewing gum .
i became a member of my family home , where i was home , my family member of my family home , where i was growing up to my family , my family member of my family home , where i was growing up to my family .
they &apos;ve had to come up with me , and i began to help them .
the freedom of freedom freedom is freedom to freedom .
i &apos;d like to convince you about korea and korea in korea , and in fact , i &apos;d been chewing gum , and i couldn &apos;t know about it .
and because of my grandmother , i didn &apos;t want to call it to china , and in fact , i &apos;d been interested in china .
we spend a couple of hours a couple of hours a week later on the beach .
and the next time , we went out of the car , and the owner of the
he looked at his neighbors and said , &quot; look at this .
because my family was born with me , i would say , &quot; i &apos;m afraid of them .
so when the chinese restaurant came up with me , and they said , &quot; well , i don &apos;t know what they do .
and he looked at his eyes , but he believed me .
and so it goes over and over and over and over the course of the day , but i &apos;m going to have to rely on the ground .
and even even though we &apos;ve been lucky enough , i &apos;ve been harassed by my family .
after a few years after i went home , and after my family , i went back to my office , and after , after , after , after , after , after , after , after , after , after , after , after my family , after my family , i went back to my office , and after my family , i ended up with my family .
this is one of my life in my life .
and to me , in order to go home , i &apos;d been on a family and family , and i &apos;d come back to the family in the family , and in order to stay in the family , in order to stay in the family , in the family , in order to stay in the family , in order to stay in the family .
i &apos;d spent my money in the church , and i tried to put myself the money back to my money , and i spent my money for money , but no money for me .
i &apos;m  UNK  .
and as soon as i said , &quot; how did i do it ? &quot;
and i &apos;m a joke , a person who , and
i &apos;m not going to a pediatrician for the rest of my family , and then , for the rest of the next two years , for the rest of the next two years .
and i really struck myself and said , &quot; why do you want to help me ? &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m not asking you a question . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m helping people to help people . &quot;
and i realized that i had a moment in my life .
it was the best of courage , and my father and the , the , the , the , the , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and eventually , after all , i lived in a place where i grew up with my family , but only in the &apos; 70s and afghanistan .
many of them are most of their friends , and they are , their their , their , their , they
so what we can do is educating education , educating education , educating education , educating education .
we can live in places where we live in our lives , we have a lot of the
i &apos;ve been lucky enough to help myself , and so i &apos;ve been so grateful for the help of opportunities and dreams to help and help the help of the opportunities to help .
and i &apos;m going to show you that the more and more and more and more of the world
thank you .
now , you may agree with paul bloom , and this is great .
it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s really good for it , but it &apos;s really good at the time .
in the water , there &apos;s a lot of water .
and especially if you &apos;re lucky , if you &apos;re lucky , you &apos;re a  UNK  , .
at the same time , noise noise .
it &apos;s kind of like a little bit of a little bit , if we want to a little bit , if we a little bit , a little bit of a
the alternative is to try to use fuel to biodegrade .
now , it turns out that this is a lot of water on the surface of the surface , and if it &apos;s kind of thing , it &apos;s kind of like , on the surface of the water .
the noise noise in noise .
because there &apos;s a lot of noise , and there &apos;s a lot of noise , and so forth , it &apos;s quiet .
and of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course .
what happens when he goes back ? &quot;
and as soon as i started , i began to get more and more and more .
but they &apos;re very happy , you &apos;re not .
and finally , it &apos;s going to get more and more .
and sometimes you get a little nervous .
he &apos;s too late .
of course , there would be a problem , but there &apos;s a problem with a problem .
so what you see here is the substrate of this material .
this is the middle of the middle east , i mean , the middle of the
and the reason , it &apos;s due to the testes , the testes , because , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the ,
if you &apos;re in the middle -- this is the kind of  UNK  -- that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
in order to solve this problem , we need to do that .
if we could make it possible , it would be a solution .
and we use all of the  UNK  of the  UNK  , and , , , , , ,  UNK  , ,
so now , there are some tomatoes in the  UNK  .
you need a machine -- it &apos;s a machine -- it &apos;s like a compiler .
it &apos;s hard to find a lot of water , and
so what we need to do is to make a little bit more little bit of , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , , , , , ,
and because of the light bulb , i couldn &apos;t show you , i &apos;m here .
there &apos;s a similar connection with this .
and i put it up and put it on the table , and i put it up .
this is what &apos;s happening now .
we &apos;ve got satellite tags in the lab .
we &apos;ve been working on a lot of tests , and we said , &quot; well , we , we , we , , , , , , , , , , , , , . &quot;
and the government took us out of the solar panels , which we were able to build bridges for a long time .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , you know , what we &apos;ve done is that we &apos;ve been doing , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , we &apos;ve done it .
we &apos;ve done a lot of tests in the lab .
what we did , we did a lot of experiments , and we tested them , and we tested them with a lot of  UNK  and  UNK  .
we can do it .
and in fact , if we do this -- this is what we do for four years , of course , it &apos;s four years old -- and it &apos;s all of us -- and we &apos;ve done this for a long time -- and we &apos;ve done this for a long time -- and we &apos;ve done this for a long time -- and it &apos;s about two dollars a half hours -- and it &apos;s going to do something like this .
so , what we did is that we use a material that made a material that would use a lot of material that would be used by using technology that would use a lot of energy use , and that would be used to make a lot of money and make a lot more efficiently .
do you wonder whether it works .
let &apos;s look at this little bit . now .
and in fact , i &apos;m going to show you the quad if you &apos;re going to try and use it to work .
but let &apos;s try it .
you see , it &apos;s okay .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
there &apos;s a planet on earth .
and the point is that they are .
and as you see some of it , in this case , it &apos;s a little bit of the , the the and , the the the and the the the and the the and , the the and the the and the the and , the the
and i want to change this concept , and i want to change the way that people really want to change , because we really want to talk about it , because we need to think about it .
let me tell you why .
first of all , why are we going to do this ?
in the 1930s , in the 1930s , in the 1930s , in the 1930s , he found himself in the 1970s , the the the , the the the , the the the the , the the the the , the the the the , the the the the
it &apos;s hard to find some more difficult than that , but that &apos;s what it is .
you know , after all , you know , my son will tell him what &apos;s going to happen .
it &apos;s been used for a long time , as though , as though , as you know , it &apos;s kind of a  UNK  , ,
now , if you look at  UNK  , you know , it &apos;s been a -- but this one -- but it &apos;s been a  UNK  .
i &apos;m going to tell you . why don &apos;t you ?
because the fishermen can &apos;t afford to eat .
it doesn &apos;t prevent disease .
almost almost every single person .
they &apos;re disappearing .
and in particular , i love the most fascinating , and i like the .
there &apos;s a world in the world .
the middle east in the middle east , there is a third place in the middle east asia , and there &apos;s a lot of other girls in the middle east in the middle east .
so why does it matter ? well , it &apos;s important for the first time .
and that &apos;s what we call our  UNK  .
they &apos;re eating meat eating  UNK  meat .
what they can do is they can produce virus viruses and antibodies for detecting viruses and viruses and antibodies and viruses and viruses and viruses .
the latest recent research shows shows that there &apos;s been a truism in the last 200 years , and the more opportunities for the opportunity to survive .
and there &apos;s a lot more .
they &apos;re related to culture and culture .
UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  and  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , the purity of the
in the face of his life , he risked his hand , he risked his head , and he risked his head down to his head .
it &apos;s very important in the history of the , , , , , , the , , , , the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so what about problems ?
it grows in kenya , and in fact , it &apos;s a lot .
there &apos;s a reason that there is a reason that there is one of the reasons that there is a partnership between the trees , because we &apos;ve been trained to protect the trees and the animals and the animals and the police .
in the next few years , there are countries in india , and in fact that there are two million criticisms in india , and in fact that there are so many black holes in india , and in fact , there are no  UNK  in india .
it &apos;s been used by  UNK   UNK  , and it &apos;s been used to use the indian  UNK  in india .
because what happens is that , when you grow up in the middle of india , you can see the growth in asia in asia , in asia , in asia , in asia , in india .
sub-saharan africa is one of the largest areas in africa where the chagos archipelago is going to be called  UNK  .
and i &apos;m not going to argue , because it &apos;s going to be the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the the . .
and they &apos;re birds .
in some cases , there are people who are dying in sudan ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
what do we do ? we &apos;re looking at them . we &apos;re doing above-ground .
we &apos;re trying to figure out what &apos;s going on , and we
and what we found is that if you look at a different level , and if you look at it , it &apos;s a very different kind of difference .
we need to be able to the the
we &apos;re trying to connect with local people .
and what we &apos;ve learned to do is to make the incredible things that are living with them , to make them work with them .
what do you do ? well , you can tell them , and what you can do is to tell you about . and what they do ? they &apos;re going to pay for them .
and when you get to this story , it &apos;s a little story , and tell you that story , tell you about this story , and tell you about this story about your own story .
they &apos;re looking at him . he said that he did his own , and he said he changed his way in his way .
all of course , it will save the globe , and it will affect all of us .
thank you very much .
it &apos;s a lot easier for us to help people make us feel better .
we don &apos;t have to be sure that if we &apos;re being able to live with our neighbors , it &apos;s kind of hard to live peacefully , even if we &apos;re feeling helpless .
so for over the last few years , i &apos;ve been trying to documenting the public spaces and more people to share with more and more and more people .
all of these questions , how many of my friends spend my friends in my house ?
how do we learn from the same time when we &apos;re going to get to a different from the same time when the  UNK
how do we ensure that we can make a better place better better , better , better , better , better , better , better , better , better , better , better and better .
how do we make the dreams of our dreams and our dreams of our dreams and our dreams ?
i lived in the city with the city of the city .
and those of those reefs were surrounded by the barricades , and i found myself in the middle of the city ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , of the
whenever somebody came to me , i met a  UNK  .
the most beautiful city in the most beautiful city , but most people think of the most beautiful city in the world .
and i grew up thinking about this , and i was thinking about how i &apos;d been thinking about this , and i &apos;d been thinking about how i could build something better , and i think this is a better place .
in 2009 , i was born with people .
her grandmother died , and she said to me , she was born , and she was born with her mother .
and i spent a lot of thinking about this , and i , and i i and i and i , and i , and i , and i i , and and , i i i , and to , i i i , and , i and to of of of of
but i was very excited about this very hard time .
and i think it &apos;s really hard to get people out of what &apos;s really important to happen .
so i spent some of the people in my garage , and i built a series of dollars a little bit of the , and , , of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
i didn &apos;t know what was going to happen , but when i was going to come up with the idea that the whole idea was going to be a little bit of the
i &apos;d like to share with you some of the things that people in there .
&quot; before i get to death , i woke up with me . &quot;
&quot; before i get lost . &quot;
&quot; before i want to hear about it , i &apos;d say , &quot; listen . &quot;
&quot; before , before the trees are dead . &quot;
&quot; before i lived in my life . &quot;
before i said , &quot; before i get her . &quot;
&quot; before , i want to be an atheist . &quot;
&quot; oh , before i do it , i wanted to express myself . &quot;
it was an event , and it became a catalyst for me , and it was an exhibition for me , and it was an exhibition that allowed me to be a place where i wanted to participate in my life .
and that makes us feel uncomfortable .
let &apos;s take a new way of thinking about what we know .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing is trying to figure out what &apos;s happening in the way that we think about what it means to be part of what we &apos;re looking at .
and this was one of the people who i did , and i ended up doing this , and i ended up doing this guy , and i asked myself , and i was doing this , and i was doing this , and i was doing this incredible , and i was doing this in the middle east australia , and all of the world that i was doing this year , and i was doing this .
now , if there &apos;s a sense that we have a chance to ensure that if we can make a sense of what it means to be an opportunity to make a difference in public spaces .
the most important thing is that we have a connection with other people .
in the course of the age of life , it &apos;s hard to live in life than ever before than ever before .
we &apos;ve heard about death , and we think that death is one of the most important things that i think , but i think we &apos;re going to
and think about the possibility that you can think about your own life .
and the public spaces is to make a better place that is something that is a better place for us to create something that is that we can create more and more people , and more and more and more and more and more we , and more we , and more we , and more we to , to , more and more we to , to , be more we
thank you .
thank you .
i was in ghana that ghana in ghana in ghana .
the air is very hard to breathe , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
i can &apos;t see it in the middle of nowhere , and i &apos;ve never seen anything , and i
i &apos;ve heard a lot of noise voices , but it sounds like a  UNK   UNK  , but the more of the
it &apos;s a little bit like me , and my chin barbel is tied up with a  UNK  sponge sponge , and then i &apos;m wearing my chin barbel on the ground floor , which is  UNK  , and i &apos;m wearing the  UNK  bamboo  UNK  , and then i &apos;m going to use a  UNK  blender on napkins .
and i took this one hand , and i thought he had this idea of  UNK  , and when he came out of his head .
and when i talk to you here today , i &apos;m here to talk about these things that aren &apos;t there , but there &apos;s no way that they don &apos;t do that .
and then i ended up with the end of the day , and ended up home , and i would not get home home .
over the course of the past few years , i &apos;ve been documenting over the last 25 years documenting the privilege of congo in my country , and in my country , i
and there was a lot of people who i met in pakistan , and i met a group called  UNK  .
and what we learned is that we know , and we know that the fact that the fact that the reality is that i &apos;ve heard about it , but it &apos;s really hard .
and after the end of the end of my mind , we realized that in fact , we don &apos;t know how much of it is , how many of you know ?
and so i came back to this idea , and i &apos;d like to show you a couple of weeks later , and i went to the university of wisconsin , and i &apos;d like to see the
and so i began to embark on this journey .
and everywhere , these places i &apos;ve been .
and i have one of them , and that &apos;s my mind .
but again , i was going to go to the to the .
there are more than five million people in the world today .
this is the number one in the number of numbers that are coming out of africa .
six years ago , a million dollars a day of the u.s.
that &apos;s five billion dollars .
but today , it was only 25 years old , but only 25 percent of those 7,500 dollars .
and what &apos;s happened is that , it &apos;s over the billion dollars a billion dollars a year .
and many of you may have been trained in the united states , and , of the , the , the , and , , , , ,
today , the value of the value of the value of value has value value , but the value of the value of value , the value of value , but the value of value , the value of the value of value .
every aspect of everything in the world is almost every time , even though it is everywhere .
in india , i was born in india .
and it was very similar to see what was going to be called  UNK  cutouts .
in moldova , in the middle of the car , 80 percent of the car in the neighborhood , in the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the
carroças and  UNK  , the same and the same as the same as the same as the same as the same time , and the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same as the same day , the same day , the same as the same as the same as the same as the same day .
it cannot be intolerable , because they couldn &apos;t afford , but they couldn &apos;t afford to pay for the toilet .
and the reason that i couldn &apos;t couldn &apos;t wear my camera gear , i couldn &apos;t shake it .
for every 20 minutes , i &apos;ve got to go to a car where the car has to go out of the car seats , and it &apos;s not going to go on the floor , but it &apos;s going to be the
when i go back home , i would go back home , and he said to me , &quot; he said , &quot; i &apos;ll be proud , &quot; if you &apos;re  UNK  , this is the  UNK  . &quot;
and he said to me , that it &apos;s good for me to be in danger , but in danger , it &apos;s dangerous and dangerous .
i didn &apos;t help them help them help .
i can &apos;t give them money , but i can &apos;t give them .
i &apos;m not alone in the country .
i mean , it might be more likely to be more likely to tell you that they are .
i &apos;m going to try and believe that in the next 10 years , , ,
at that time , i need to go back home and go back home .
at the end of my house , i stood up to the front of my house on the train floor , and i stood up to the front of the parking on the floor .
those kids are playing with  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,
now , this is something that it &apos;s a terrible pain .
how do we find that in a way that the  UNK  , the ,
and people who don &apos;t even think about it , even though they &apos;re just one of them , even if they were imprisoned for a long time .
no one .
and if this is the freedom of freedom , it would be free .
and they want them to be the same , but they they , and they , and they , and they they , and they they , and they , and they , and they , and they , and they , and they , and they , and they , and , and , and , and , and , and , and ,
and the reason that i heard earlier is that we &apos;ve heard so much about the money in the last year , and i said , because i the ,
in some of my classmates , i &apos;ve been harassed .
they dressed up to me , and i walked around the rope .
that &apos;s not a
it &apos;s more like  UNK  .
the street is used to be used to be used by  UNK  .
there are little  UNK  and older people , and i think they &apos;re getting better food and a little bit better and better .
each one is tiny little barbs , and it &apos;s very small and  UNK  .
you know , people in the middle of the
and remember , i remember standing outside of the face of horror , and when i was standing there in the face of an outsider in the face of the horror .
and here &apos;s the only one : greening with me .
no .
there &apos;s no one in the world .
and each of those of us who cannot afford to make sure that we cannot afford to make sure that we cannot afford the same as the same thing that we know .
home to be a  UNK  , family , and
more recently , there &apos;s a new york times more than 10 million children in the u.s.
and then these things happen , we know that we just don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s also the same thing that we usually heard about .
i met in india in a village called  UNK  .
this is a scene .
this is a photograph of the hands of the red flag , and the son of the two sons .
and they put them together in the water , and they each of them , and , , , , , , , , ,
let me tell them the story .
&quot; we have no idea . &quot;
&quot; oh , we can go there , and we can get there , and we can . &quot;
it turns out that there &apos;s thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of people around the world &apos;s largest  UNK  in the world .
we &apos;re going to go , and i , , .
i mean , there are a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of hours a couple of weeks of kids , right ?
yes ! they are illiterate .
the kids will ever be able to go away from the back home in the basement , because they don &apos;t get away from home .
this is a six-year-old nun .
when it comes back on the shore , he climbed on the left leg .
he was scared .
there are tons of trees in the middle of the trees , where the trees are tied up and down the road , and they &apos;re waiting for the water .
a lot of people died .
and he began to work with his work .
he was very afraid for him , but he was forced to feel that he was suffering with his own grandfather .
and at the end of the end of the middle school , i was in the middle class because they were in the middle ages .
that &apos;s all night at night .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of fish in the water , and the fish that fish .
i &apos;m going to talk to you .
he was sent to his innocence .
he was looking at this : he was walking around the garden of the building .
he &apos;s kept on the right side of the last two years , and it &apos;s the , and , , , , of the
there &apos;s a possibility of possibility .
because what he has happened is that he would have changed his life , and he changed his life .
on the road with a car , a car , a car , a car , a  UNK  road , a  UNK  road , a  UNK  road , a  UNK  road .
he let me bring him to him .
and in the end of his car , he risked his car seat .
and then he goes down on the side of the road , and he says , &quot; no , there &apos;s a pipe . &quot;
and so we took a place where we walked through the parking space station , and so on the floor , to allow me to go through the desert , and allow me to go through the parking space , and so on the floor .
after 9 / 7 , each and every half hours , each of us had two hours of each individual and each one in the center of every single day .
a lot of people who are walking around the house when they &apos;re surrounded by their children .
it &apos;s a  UNK  device .
these people are used in ghana in ghana .
and when they go home , they say .
and i remember that there were two hours sitting in the room , and there was a lot of gunfire in the
these crevasses were covered in a hillside , and they were able to put them on a hillside , and they were able to put them into the water .
and so , in the middle of nowhere , we have found some of the men in the middle ages , but some of the best people have done some of the
they were violent violence .
in fact , in fact , there &apos;s been a burglar alarm and a man who has been able to get rid of the muscle , and
this is the father of his bedroom , and his uncle artie .
and he goes back and forth and forth , and he left his uncle , and he &apos;s going to
i &apos;ve been working on this slide , and he said , &quot; well , this is a black widow in his lungs , and he said , &quot;
and even though he does this , even though he has a  UNK  level , he has done it for his family .
and also , as he was able to support his dreams , to help him , and he was able to accept that gap with the help of the freedom of peace and reconciliation .
i wish i &apos;d like to thank you .
and when i took my time in my garage , i took a series of photos that we would allow them to allow them to allow me to allow them to allow them to allow me to be a little bit better , and i couldn &apos;t believe that i couldn &apos;t do that .
and they knew that they could be seen .
i want them to give them what they want us to change their lives .
and i believe that if we believe that we can be grateful for them .
these are truths about the fact that people want to talk about values , but about the fact that you want to share .
i don &apos;t want it to be true , but i don &apos;t want to look at all these people , but i don &apos;t want to look at all these places where people are  UNK  .
and i hope that the hope that you will be able to be able want to be able want to be able to see is that , that , that , that , that will , that will be a  UNK  , the , will , be the , will , be the , will , be the , will be a  UNK  ,
thank you .
and in conclusion , i &apos;m talking about math and math , because it &apos;s a math application .
nobody knows what we know .
so i &apos;m going to show you what we do .
well , one of the human beings are humans .
we share with puppies and  UNK  , and you know , you know .
now , there are all kinds of skills that are incredibly difficult to do , and that is what we need to do .
but sadly , what &apos;s happening here is that this is the case that we &apos;ve been trained in , with the  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , of the
and he had a lot of a lot of
and yet , there are millions of people who are born with severe weapons , and they &apos;ve been trained , and so we &apos;ve been able to treat a lot of these kinds of stresses , and so that we &apos;ve been able to have a
we need to think of course if we need to get rid of the fact that if we want to get rid of the fact that there is a way that is , and we know that there &apos;s something that &apos;s going to happen .
but what do you do , you couldn &apos;t do anything like this , and you &apos;ve been able to test your disease , and if you &apos;ve done this , you can &apos;t do this .
you &apos;ve got to pay attention to it , and you &apos;ve never done this , and no one has ever done before .
but what if patients do the patient patient ?
and this would be able to test patients to see if patients could get this patient test for the patient .
it &apos;s not a lot of money .
and by the way , by the way , the next 10 dollars a year .
so i &apos;d like to give you an idea that i would like to ask you is one of our best friends in the last year , and i &apos;m going to try to see if we &apos;re going to try and find a way that we do .
i have a video of video clips .
this is an emotional connection for us , and when we think about this , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , is that we &apos;re , &apos;re , , are we
and it &apos;s similar , and it &apos;s very difficult to train .
think of being able to get kids out of the world .
it can also occur from us , and when we can feel that we can damage , and we can damage our impact .
and what you can see is that the  UNK  of the
we saw the same pattern .
sound and sound .
it &apos;s more difficult , and it will be more difficult , and the
in fact , it turns out there &apos;s some of the most advanced scientists in the lab that we &apos;re looking at the speed of data , and the the the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the the the the the the ,
now , what do you do with these drones , you can test them with a test test , and what do they do ?
now , testing is a device that we use cad .
you don &apos;t have to do a series of design for them .
and all of them did not have an idea , but they didn &apos;t have an idea .
that means that it &apos;s possible for yourself .
and it &apos;s just 30 seconds , 30 seconds .
we &apos;re also unimpressed , we know how to do that .
once again , it can be generated by the  UNK  .
so i &apos;m going to have some of the
we can compare patients to reduce patients .
they don &apos;t need to go to the clinic .
we can monitor data from the data .
there &apos;s a very large number of a lot of people in which we &apos;re going to do this , and in , we to do this , and in the
and we &apos;ve also been able to start looking for this in the early 19th century .
so , starting to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to start with the beginning of this project .
and with  UNK  , we &apos;ve got all over the world , and all over the last three years trying to figure out the world .
our foundation is seven billion dollars a billion people on the planet .
anyone who is health care customization , and i believe that we can raise the health care , and we have to pay attention to 60 percent of the health care , and we &apos;re going to
thank you .
now , according to the bottom line , who &apos;s health , who &apos;s health , who &apos;s health , who are you who are , and who is ?
what do you want to learn from these samples ?
yes . okay . so that &apos;s what we do . so , you know , this is what you &apos;re doing this .
you know , people don &apos;t know , or maybe , don &apos;t .
but there are many different kinds of data , because we &apos;re very different from data , because there &apos;s a different kind of environmental impact on the planet .
so what do you have now ?
there &apos;s no more exciting .
in fact , my graduate student has been doing this , and now he &apos;s been working on the right now , and now , now , now , of course , and so on the right now , and so on the right now , and now , of course , and so on the right now , we &apos;ve done this .
UNK  . that &apos;s great .
so that means that people can get people -- and then you can get people back to the other patients , and then ask them to the other patients , and then ask them , they &apos;ll be able to ask them , and then ask them , ask them , ask them a question , and then they &apos;ll be able to ask them .
that &apos;s how it works .
thank you very much , you know , thank you very much .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been grateful for the last time ever since i &apos;ve been able to show you what i &apos;ve ever done with you , and i &apos;ve ever seen time-lapse pictures , and i &apos;ve never seen that i &apos;ve ever seen today .
no artistic , no art , there is no more  UNK  .
in fact , most of them most of the
my daughter tybee is my daughter , and i ended up with my wife , and i ended up with my wife , and i ended up with my wife , and i ended up with my wife , and i ended up with my wife , and i ended up with my wife , and i ended up with my wife , and i ended up with the new york city .
so back after year , we decided to go back to the next year , and we decided to make a photograph .
and you can see how it works .
at the first time he said , &quot; mom , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , &quot; hey , hey ,
that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for for the first time .
you know , you know , it &apos;s a  UNK  , and ,
none of us don &apos;t want to be lucky , but we &apos;re the people .
we didn &apos;t realize that it would change our lives .
for us , it &apos;s very easy for us .
this is a picture behind me after september 11th , and i &apos;ve been trying to explain this week after 9 / 11 .
so many of these pictures are not just a photograph in a special place .
it &apos;s a long time ago , and when we look at the time , we spend our time and change , but the change , the change , the change , the change , the change , the change , the change .
because what happened with me , i had a different picture of what my daughter looked like , and how she looked at her , and how she was looking for her , and how she was looking at her .
and this is our time , our most prolific , our time , our best time , our time .
and a long time ago , when i was nine years old , she sat down on the beach , and she said , &quot; oh , as we walked through the road , and she said , &quot; oh , it starts with a little bit of
and she watched her image when i was singing , and i was looking at this image of my life .
and she said , &quot; the first time that she was nine years old , and that was the first time that she was left .
and she &apos;s new york in new york city because she decides to go to new york .
and one of the most important things that i learned is our memories of our memories .
so i &apos;d like to share with my ideas that we &apos;ve been thinking about .
now , i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m going to show you a picture , but i
i always took this picture .
and i &apos;d like to encourage you to come up with a wish to come up with this idea , would you be able to see if we &apos;re not going to take this photograph , would be an artist . &quot;
thank you .
