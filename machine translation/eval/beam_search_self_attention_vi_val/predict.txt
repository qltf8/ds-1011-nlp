when i remember , i think that the money is the best country in the world , &quot; we usually don &apos;t have to envy . &quot;
i was very proud of the country .
in school , we spent a lot of time learning about the president of his  UNK  , but not unlike many of the world , except for many of the united states , except for japan and korea .
although i &apos;ve been wondering , i don &apos;t know how to myself , but i still think i &apos;m going to live in a whole life , until suddenly everything changed .
when i was seven years , i saw people in their first time , but i was still thinking about my life .
my family was not poorest , and i haven &apos;t had to wait .
but on one day by 1995 , my mother was a word of the one that was the one of the seventh of us .
and then there &apos;s writing : it &apos;s only reads your five families , and they &apos;re never even going to me even one another , because they don &apos;t have any food to eat two weeks .
every year on the floor , and we can also feel like that .
i was shocked .
because that &apos;s the first time i knew my people were suffering .
not long after that , i went to a station , which i saw a picture of it that i can never forget to the booth .
so in the station is the  UNK  of a woman who &apos;s still holding her hand and was still a little bit of  UNK  and watched her face .
but no one who has helped them because they all have to worry about my own family .
in between north korea , during the north korea .
it makes a million koreans died in famine , and many people whose lives have survived , and whose wife has to eat .
so electricity is getting more frequently , so everything around me is dark , so when i came to night from the dark to china .
i &apos;m always wondering why they have electricity , we &apos;re crazy .
this is a picture from satellite that is shot at night in relation to the united states .
this is the time that it has its natural borders between china and north korea .
you can see that there &apos;s a very narrow  UNK  north korea .
but a lot of people died .
and i looked at the bodies where they live on .
i can &apos;t tell you about how i escaped from north korea where the story is able to say that these years of famine years because of the chinese are sent to a living .
at the time , i thought i would have to be far from a long time .
it &apos;s not that i can imagine that i would have to 14 years .
in china , the life of a designated kicker every day .
i was unthinkable for what happened to the lives of refugees , how would be living from north korea , but i realized how it was extremely difficult , but not only because it &apos;s extremely difficult to china , but also because they were being used to china .
i always lived in one of my fear invaded my identity , and i was going to be discovered about what i &apos;m going to be in north korea .
one day , it was a nightmare ; i was being arrested , i was being taken the police to ask me to question .
they told me that they were told me that i was north korea , so they were able to test my ear , and i asked many questions .
i was so scared , and i had a feeling of my way up .
because if they saw anything unnatural .
i think my life is the end of my life , but i still try to control the answers .
so after the finished , one of the two police , this is a false  UNK  issue .
it &apos;s not the north korea . &quot;
and they release me . it &apos;s a miracle .
some north korea in china has gone to the embassy in china to leave alone , but many of them were caught up by the chinese state .
these girls have been very lucky .
because despite the being caught in the last summer , but at the bottom of the international community .
these north korea are not making that .
every year , there are lots of north korea in china , where they &apos;re being tortured or executed .
while i was fortunate enough to be so fortunate enough to my people , i &apos;m not so .
north korea has to some north korea and struggle to create a tragic thing as a tragedy .
even though the chinese learn english is a career , and it &apos;s also a life where they can turn upside down .
that &apos;s why the ten years after i decided to cover my identity , to go to south korea , to create a new life again .
the stability in life there are more difficult than i ever imagined .
because in korea , korean advanced korean peninsula , so i started learning english , so i started english language .
i also realized that a very big gap between north and north korea .
we are all the north korea , but it became very different results of the year divided .
i went through a crisis of my origins .
i mean , north korea than korea ?
where do i come from ? and i am ?
suddenly , i had no country to ever be called the country down .
although to respond to south korea is not very easy to korean advanced in a plan .
and i started to learn to finish college .
however , as soon as i had just come to the lives here , i told a terrible news .
the north korea has discovered some money that i sent back to my family , and for punishment , to punish failure .
so they can escape from that , i started to get started my family planning .
he north korea has gone through the distance that seem impossible to escape .
because the border guards from north korea to the north korea , so i was able to fly over the chinese to the north korea .
because my family didn &apos;t know , i had to go to the same 2,000 people in southeast indian southeast asia .
the bus took an entire hour for a week , and we &apos;ve been  UNK  for a couple of steps .
once again , our car was driven by our foot then made by a warrant about a police in the united nations .
he tried to prove everything , and he started  UNK  .
because my family didn &apos;t understand chinese language , so i thought they were arrested .
when the chinese came to the police , i stood up immediately and said to him that this is the deaf people that i &apos;m walking up .
he looked at me , but it &apos;s very lucky , but he &apos;s good news .
and we go on to the border , but i have already had to be used to the entire  UNK  of the border guards .
however , after we got too much , across borders , which was being arrested because i followed by illegal .
after i was able to send money to the bribe , my family was released together in a month , and once again in the capital .
that was desperate in my life .
i did all kinds of invitations to get to get to get to get to the freedom , and i was so successful , and we were just caught in a very short distance .
i went back to the room between the  UNK  and despair , struggle to get away from my family , but i didn &apos;t get any money to pay for a bribe .
i was desperate .
at the time , there &apos;s a man who asked me , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
i was absolutely amazing to a stranger who was totally strange .
with a little sentence in english and a dictionary , i &apos;ve already told you had to look good circumstances , but he had a little bit of my family , some people had paid all the money for my family , and i had all these two different families .
i thank you for my heart , and i said , &quot; why do you ask me , &quot; why do you help me ? &quot;
&quot; i don &apos;t help him . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m helping north korea . &quot;
i realized that it was a very different kind of meaning in my life .
liquid kindness gives strangers that becomes a symbol for me , and i hope for north korea , and that we are in north korea , and he was able to see that kindness gives us a silver bullet , and the international community that stood for north korea .
finally , after a long journey , my family has been united and the united states , where the united states is only half of the fight .
a lot of north korea has been divided for their family , and when they go to another country , they have to start with very little bit or less money .
so we can get the help from international community educated , train to educate english , and many other areas .
we can also act as a bridge between the north korea , because there is in north korea , because there are many people in the world , there are many other family members of the country , and we share them with money and we can change the north korea .
i was incredibly lucky enough to get a lot of help and inspiring my life , so i want to be able to get them to the country to offer the opportunity to bring together to the rise to the international support of the international aid .
i believe you &apos;re going to see more and more and more people in the world , including the ted stage on the ted stage .
thank you .
i &apos;m just going to have a request .
please don &apos;t tell me that i &apos;m normal .
now i want to introduce you to my brother to my sister .
UNK  22 ,  UNK  , and very handsome , young men .
i don &apos;t say , but they communicate in a number of ways that even the world can &apos;t .
UNK  knows what love is .
he shared it in a way .
she doesn &apos;t greed . they don &apos;t color .
i don &apos;t care about religion , and understand that says : you &apos;re never lying .
when i sing those songs from our childhood , trying to remember from my childhood , but i couldn &apos;t remember what i could call it .
it was 16 years old . i &apos;m a very handsome .
i have a perfect memory .
but it &apos;s also selection .
i don &apos;t remember if you can turn them into my sister -- that &apos;s not my case , but i remember the point of my song on the &apos; pod then came to the conversations between the four and my four years old age , and when my first woman walks on her life .
but it sounds really cool , isn &apos;t it ?
but most people don &apos;t agree .
and in fact , the mind is that i didn &apos;t bother you with your society , because they were often done .
but my relieved at my heart and soul and though i am more powerful , even though it &apos;s true , although i &apos;m not supposed to be normal , that you can be quite extraordinary .
for those of you who aren &apos;t familiar with autism , it &apos;s a disturbances in the brain that are in social contact , and sometimes interspecies communication , and sometimes physical  UNK  .
million people in every single individual concern , that &apos;s why is so sam  UNK  .
and over the world , 20 minutes old , and yet another one is diagnosed with autism , and yet it &apos;s one of the fastest growing speed in the world , at the speed of the way , we don &apos;t know the causal approach to the causes of autism .
and i couldn &apos;t remember the first time with autism , but i couldn &apos;t remember one day without it .
i was three years old when i was born , and i was excited that there was one of the people in my life .
and after a few months , i realized that i was different .
i saw a lot .
i don &apos;t want to play the other children , and in fact , and it doesn &apos;t seem to be fun .
UNK  and living in the world , with its own institutions , with my own rule , and i see the most little things that you know , fold in the room and stare at  UNK  in the room and feed at whatever .
when i grew up , i became more different , and it became clear .
but anger came out and our anger , and it doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s a really unique thing : a pure white , pure pleasure and naive , a little bit sweet , innocent and a bias , a little bit of a human being .
extraordinary .
well , i can &apos;t deny that there were a few moments of my siblings that i hope you will be like .
but i had my memory back to the things that i learned about my character , communication and i realized that this is something that i &apos;m not going to get out there .
the normal danger is just so beautiful that it makes us different , and we don &apos;t have any means something wrong .
it means that there &apos;s a different kind of thing .
and if i can only communicate one thing for a  UNK  and give you a sam and says , you don &apos;t have to do it .
you can do it .
because there are autism , or not differences between us -- and we have a gift within us , and quite frankly , we &apos;re a big deal with gifts , and frankly , the big sacrifice the potential to sacrifice the big potential .
the great opportunity for development , and the great opportunity is to turn out when we try to collapse .
please -- don &apos;t say that i &apos;m normal .
thank you .
maybe you all agree with me , this is a beautiful path .
it &apos;s built from the tar ; it &apos;s the sand on the car , but it &apos;s not always ; it &apos;s not always true , especially today . it &apos;s not like today .
then you can get water on the gold .
and especially if you ride a bicycle , and these cars , it &apos;s not true .
also , the tar noise too .
it &apos;s the fine materials , if we do the same way as the netherlands is close to cities , we want to be a quiet street .
the solution to the problem is the tar from the road .
the tar sand is the material is that we &apos;re putting up in the netherlands , and it &apos;s got water through all the water through the collection , so every rain tomorrow morning comes out , and you &apos;ll have a road to get your own water .
and noise also disappeared .
because it &apos;s very wide , all the noise will disappear .
of course remains a lot of inconvenient , and that this is a kind of  UNK  , it may be  UNK  .
what &apos;s the field ? you see on this path , it &apos;s broken .
first of all , you &apos;ve got a little more , and then more , more and more , more , and then -- they won &apos;t do it .
but they could also be for a car , so you &apos;re not happy with that .
and ultimately , the ball would crash and break it up .
sometimes they make the chicken .
ah . he &apos;s ready .
right , of course , can be a problem , but we have a solution .
actually , you see there is some sort of a damaged body .
it &apos;s a plastic , as i said , you &apos;ve only got a little bit of  UNK  sticks with rocks .
under the weather , the sun radiation , the sun , the sun  UNK  , this collagen and the glue between the collagen and the ideology of resistance , it &apos;s  UNK  , it &apos;s going to get rid of it .
and then if you drive along the way , you &apos;ll destroy these cubes -- like we just saw here .
to address this issue , we built the material but together .
if we created this material is made together , we could find a solution .
what we can do is we can do is we do with  UNK  , and we cut the grass and we cut it apart , and we remember putting these little pieces together with plastic particles .
so we &apos;ve got this tar with steel .
so you need a machine , as you can see here , which is unfortunately to cook a light from a sensors .
it &apos;s a  UNK  heat , especially good heat conductor .
but what you do is heat up with plastic heating , you heat up and plastic , and you &apos;ll run into these little  UNK  particles , and they &apos;re going to go back into the  UNK  , and the grade .
today i &apos;m going to be a microwave range of sensors that i can &apos;t get on the stage .
the microwave range is exactly the same kinds of operations .
i was leaving the ink in black holes , now i &apos;m going to take a look at it .
this is the prototype .
i said , we invented a whole thing in the lab , in the lab to heat up .
in our lab , we &apos;ve tried many models , and then they actually saw the results , and they said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do it . &quot;
and then they gave us a  UNK  road , which is one millimeter at  UNK  , which we had to build a new material .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done here . we &apos;ve been trying to see the street , and then of course , and then of course that there will be no longer exists in many years .
we &apos;ve taken these specimens from these lines , and we tried them in the lab .
so we would  UNK  , which you would put loads the loads you would see them from  UNK  , which they would gather together again .
we can do it again and do it again .
and in fact , the conclusion from this research is that if we reduce the  UNK  -- this is the size of a  UNK  version -- this is the size of  UNK  -- if we built it was four years -- if we were able to do double the  UNK  , of course , we could save a lot of money on the road . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
well , to  UNK  , i can tell you that we &apos;ve created a new type of material using steel , putting the use of the heat from the ground to feed the ground to the ground floor , you can actually increase the amount of life expectancy -- you &apos;re going to do , you &apos;re going to save a lot of money .
now you may be wondering whether it &apos;s effective or not .
we &apos;ve got the animal here . it &apos;s quite warm .
it should have to be put it before people , and then i would have a sense of healing , which is healing .
but let me try it .
look .
thank you .
so today i &apos;m here to talk about a question that the answers that shouldn &apos;t be confusing .
the topic of violence , the secret violence and the question that people ask me questions : why is it always ?
why are women supposed to stay with them ?
i &apos;m not a doctor ; it &apos;s a partnership , not a professional society or an expert on domestic violence .
i &apos;m just a woman who wanted to share her story .
when i was 22 , i graduated from harvard graduate school .
i moved to new york city in new york city for the first editor .
for the first time i had an american express footprints , and i had a big secrets of me .
the secret is , the gun that was loaded with bullet -- in january , which i was in my head by the man , i thought , from this partner again and again , from another partner and again .
the man i fell in love with love with the gun that was not death threats to the doors that i wouldn &apos;t remember .
i &apos;m here to tell you about romantic love , a tribal psychology , which is under the camouflage worn by millions of men .
this is your story .
i don &apos;t look like a domestic violence .
i have a bachelor &apos;s degree in harvard business school , and business school .
i &apos;ve been sort of career working out in the 500 of american businesses , like johnson and said , leo and  UNK  and washington .
i married my husband has been two 20 years ago , and she got her kids together .
my own dog is a black voice , and i got back to my lab .
so the first thing i want to talk to you about domestic violence is what happens to everyone in religion , every level , every religion and education .
it &apos;s happening everywhere .
and the second thing i want to say that violence is that the domestic violence is women &apos;s women .
no .
over 85 percent of violence is the men and domestic violence , and the only happens in the workplace , in other words , the end of the business , where we expected to finally look , and finally violence is a very confusing to finally violence .
i myself told myself to myself , i was drawn to the planet with men , but it was actually a victim , but it was a victim by my victim .
i &apos;m 22 years old , living in the united states , women from  UNK  to the  UNK   UNK  of her violence victims , and the girls of their domestic violence against women and 500 girls in these women and girls in the united states , and women who were killed each other in the united states , and the violence against women in the united states .
i also used to be a victim by violence , because i don &apos;t know the implications of your family or your business model .
i met  UNK  in a january , and i bought a cold night .
he sat next to me in the new york city , and i kept speaking .
he told me about two things .
one is he , just as i graduate school , and he also graduated from his work on the wall street .
but the most likely thing to do with me to meet is that he &apos;s the first british and he &apos;s funny .
he had massive processed wooden boots , which is the largest  UNK  cheeks , and i had a huge  UNK  hair -- and so sweet that it seems sweet .
one of the smartest one of the smartest  UNK  , ever since beginning , it &apos;s a relationship that i &apos;m a promise of the illusion that i &apos;m a promise .
he &apos;s doing this at first time , we know how to master i dropped .
we started dating , and he fell in love with me that i &apos;m smart that i chose to harvard , that i &apos;m afraid to help the new work and big help .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my life , and i had my childhood dream .
i believe , as a writer , and i think a woman who has no one .
and he also created the  UNK  of the wonder of the  UNK  of the connection between him , and his secrets that he takes us as a child abuse , and his  UNK  with a  UNK  fear of abuse and his career because he became obsessed with his body and physically leave him with violence , although he managed to get him lost a good job .
that &apos;s why degrees at the degrees in  UNK  and the future jobs and the beauty of the future .
if you tell me that the men who are smart , funny and i would like to remember a day when i was done , then i put on the face of my job , i was done , i was in my head , where i was , and i would tell you what my ritual was , where there was no one or lose control .
i didn &apos;t know that the first phase of any domestic violence is the temptation to join the others .
i also don &apos;t know that the second phase was isolated .
now , back home didn &apos;t go to the day and says , &quot; hey , you know , there &apos;s no doubt , and this is amazing , but i needed to replace this 220 i &apos;m going to talk to the next stage where i would say , &quot; oh my gosh , i can hear this talk — and hear people from the city where she can hear his family and say , &quot; and i can see her family , &quot; and i can hear from  UNK  . &quot;
instead of  UNK  , and i went home on a friday and he told me that he thought he was meant for her dream today , and he was telling me that he said he was safe , because i was safe , because i felt that he was safe and i needed to prove it to the city wall street , and he would show me more  UNK  against the town , and then he would just turn off the town and then he would start to  UNK  my home town .
now , the last thing i want to do is to make my dream work , but i thought you must have to make my partner , so i had to stop my partner and go together .
i don &apos;t think that i have been plunged into a love affair , that i was first step into psychological and took the money off , and then you have carefully designed the carefully controlled .
the next step in this scenario is the violence under threat and watching her response .
from the gun , these  UNK  guns .
when we moved to new england -- you know , where it &apos;s based on the  UNK  -- he feels safe to get the gun -- he bought  UNK  .
he kept a tree collecting in his own car .
a tree is called the bed for us third tree .
and he said he was saying that he needed these guns because the damage that he suffered as a young boy in the past .
he need to get them to feel protected .
but this gun was actually an answer to my hands , although he gave me a hand and although he hadn &apos;t counted on my life in the dark matter .
the  UNK  was attack my first year before we were weddings .
it was at seven o &apos;clock in the morning i was wearing asleep .
i &apos;m trying to figure out on the roof , and i was  UNK  , and i noticed the anger , as a  UNK  , as i can grab my hands as fast as i would have access to the body position of nowhere near his hand and i can stop screaming .
five days later , the  UNK  on top of the board , and i got married , and my mother would marry me , and married my mom .
despite all of the things that happened , i &apos;m still sure that we &apos;re going to live because i love and he loves me .
and he was incredibly excited .
he was really nervous because he was weddings and family  UNK  .
it was a  UNK  , and he would never push through the finished , and i would never hurt him .
it happened two more times in  UNK  .
the first time i &apos;m driving a beach to find a secret , he &apos;s lost me on a very strong side of the window on the side of the window .
a few days later , when driving home after he was driving his car , and he was driving his car , and he was throwing all the big fish in the big bang .
and then i went to a second time for two weeks during the course of six months after the year .
i was wrong to think that i was the only case i am in my single story .
a third of american women experienced violence in a certain number of domestic violence and the reduction in the middle age of 15 million abuse each of 15 million abuse .
so , i really was in a good company .
so my question is : why am i here ?
the answer is easy .
i don &apos;t know you &apos;re in my violence .
he pointed at the gun , i was shot down here , and i killed my keys , to get off the key to the car drivers removed from the car , and when i was driving the car through the  UNK  , and i was trying to get my own car , and i would never get back to my car , like an hour from the day .
instead , i am a strong female character in love for a man who has a problem , and i &apos;m the only one that can help the people face the earth .
the other question that people ask is , why is she left ?
why did i not walk ? i can abandon any time .
for me , it &apos;s the most sad and painful , because we know some of the things that you don &apos;t know : it &apos;s a terrible thing to do is a terrible wave of violence .
because finally the violence in the end of domestic violence was killed .
over the 70 percent of the crime evidence that happens after she ends , having sex after she left , because then the violence is not because after the violence is gone .
but the other consequences are failing , even after being used to be  UNK  ; the business of finance has been  UNK  and the whole system to eat the baby and victims of their families to get married , because these kids who are often terrified , because the judgment was afraid of the doors wouldn &apos;t be delighted to monitor their assumptions that they were  UNK  by their way .
and we have a little bit , why is it ?
i could walk away , because one finally  UNK  finally left out of my absolute silence .
i realized that men were very loved to me , i would kill him .
so i gave my silence .
i tell people : next to the neighbor , who have their neighbors , and family , who are totally alien , and i &apos;m totally unknown , because you are today .
we have stereotypes about the  UNK  of scary things like the women , but the destruction of the women are vulnerable .
the question , &quot; why are you ? &quot;
it &apos;s a number of people , &quot; this is the error of the victims who were choice like that .
but when i was published , &quot; i love a great story from women and men and women who have learned to go through life lessons -- but a priceless of their life , and building things that have built out of life , and building happiness -- people who are living things like -- and people who live in life , not as violence .
because the truth is that a victim of violence has ended up with the domestic violence is survival .
i got married to a man with a good men and belly , and we got together .
i give you the back to the black hills , and i have a  UNK  model .
i never had any given time , again , forever is a gun that i put where someone in my head , because he said he loves me .
right now , you might be thinking , &quot; well , this is amazing , &quot; or &quot; how she is there , &quot; how one idiot is this time .
i &apos;m sure that you &apos;re hearing these people are listening to these guys were being told that were being persecuted and black with the abuse neglect .
the abuse of your girl &apos;s affecting your sister , your best friend , who &apos;s your best friend right now .
i had the end of my crazy love with my silence .
i &apos;m now  UNK  .
this is how i helped other victims , and this is the last i &apos;m asking my final thoughts .
let &apos;s talk about what you &apos;re hearing here .
silence is just frightening .
you have the power to ending violence with the domestic violence in a ray of light .
we need victims to come to everybody .
we need to understand the secret violence to understand the secret violence .
the wolves of the light that day by talking about the kids today , where your friends , your colleagues , your friends and family .
they wrote the rest of their lives , loving people with the future .
the early detection of violence and the  UNK  of the conscience of the conscience of the  UNK  , for the victims .
together we can get our sleep , our family and our food security and our safety and our peace and safe .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about a group of animals .
there &apos;s about 10,000 birds in the world .
UNK  is one of the most disruptive groups of the greatest risk .
when you see a ken -- like this , this was the first thing that came out of your mind , these are ugly creatures , ugly , are really ugly and ugly , and it &apos;s really shitty to politicians .
i want to change that perception . i want to change the feelings you want to get these birds , because they need to pity .
i &apos;m going to tell you why .
first of all , why do they get bad ?
when charles darwin went through the pacific monsoon  UNK  ,  UNK  , he sees  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  .
you can &apos;t get a possibly even worse , and that &apos;s a charles darwin .
you know , he changed his life when he came back to the time , let me tell you why .
they &apos;re also being connected to the disney world -- that personality  UNK  , stupid , stupid messages .
more recently , if you &apos;re watching in kenya -- this is what this primary attributes that are  UNK  with the attributes that i want to resist this assault .
i want to resist this assault because you know ?
because  UNK  is not keeping the environment .
UNK  don &apos;t help transmission of disease .
they don &apos;t do that .
they &apos;re longer extinct .
and , what i like to do is , but in the more  UNK  .
there are two species on the planet .
but the kind of  UNK  in the united states , which is mostly like  UNK  and  UNK   UNK   UNK  , where there &apos;s about 16 , which is about 16 species that are among the actual risk of extinction .
so why is it important ? first of all , they provide basic services .
they &apos;re really natural gas .
they cleaned up the pile of dead bodies .
they kill bacteria . they &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but the most recent research has shown that there are no  UNK  areas that don &apos;t have about three times , and the consequence of the  UNK  and the limitations of this incredible work .
there &apos;s also a big history of their importance .
they were  UNK  with culture .
UNK  is the symbol of the mother and  UNK  , and together with the  UNK  , they fused  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  of the egyptian &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
in the myths ,  UNK  was the gods , he had risking the lives of the  UNK  .
in culture of tibet , it &apos;s very important . but it &apos;s not right here in tibet , but it &apos;s not going to die or die , so there &apos;s no adequate , so the waste of a system .
so what about  UNK  ?
we have eight types of  UNK  in kenya , in six of endangered species .
the reason they &apos;re reading , they can poisoned our food because there &apos;s a lot of people -- and wildlife these lightweight communities that uses these toxins to promote the predators , so these animals to see the victims , so these victims .
in the south asia , of india and pakistan , the  UNK  list of the things that are being recorded on less than eight or 10 years from less than 10 or 15 years to leave the  UNK  to become extinct because they &apos;re too slowly , because it turns out that they have to be treated with their head .
this belongs to the  UNK  in the veterinarian and the  UNK  in india .
because there &apos;s no greater abundance of each  UNK  for the number of miles of waste , but when you have given an enormous amount of  UNK  bomb , which has a huge amount of  UNK  on indian reservation .
kenya is going to be the country &apos;s largest wind in africa will be built by  UNK  lake  UNK  .
i &apos;m not against power , but we need to cooperate with the government , because now the birds make these things like this .
they are addicted to the birds .
in west africa has a terrible trade center for the job market to serve the meal .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve been doing research on these birds .
we &apos;re trying to figure out of their entire palm oil , and track where they come to .
we can see them moving to a lot of different countries , so if you just focus on a scale , so it doesn &apos;t do anything for you .
we need to work with government on the local level .
we &apos;re working with local communities .
we &apos;re talking to them about the  UNK  , but it &apos;s necessary for the existence of these amazing creatures and benefits .
how do you do it ? you can become an active users , where you can write your own government can write your own government and tell us that we need a little bit of these  UNK  message .
when you walk out of this room , you get the information back of the birds , or the  UNK  of your family , your children , your neighbor , your children , your children , your children &apos;s neighbor .
they &apos;re very , charles darwin said that he was looking at the time because he looked at the sense of the sky .
in kenya , it &apos;s going to be a lot more poor , but there is no such great beast .
thank you very much .
when i was 11 years old , i woke up to me when i got up in my house .
my dad was listening to the bbc at the radio .
he was a very big smile , which is very unusual , because it &apos;s very often very disturbing .
he &apos;s up : &quot; four , the taliban nailed up ! &quot;
i didn &apos;t know very well , but i can see that my father was very happy .
&quot; now you can actually go to school . &quot;
one morning that i can &apos;t forget .
a school is really .
you know , the taliban  UNK  came from afghanistan when i was six older and younger and older .
in five years later , i would dress in a month , i walked with my son , just a secret school because i was banned from my home .
that &apos;s the only way we can go to school .
every day , we &apos;re going to be different from the road to point .
we have rich books in the wind , and we would just go shopping .
her head was in a house to be more than 100 in us were not pushing us in one .
pretty warm during the wintertime , but summer is incredibly hot summer .
we all know the risk of their lives , both our teachers and parents and our teachers .
there &apos;s a couple of times a school closed for about a week because of the taliban .
we always wondered what we knew about .
are they being tracked ?
do they tell us ?
we &apos;ve been so scared , but we still wanted to go to school .
i &apos;m very fortunate enough to grow a family and love to value .
my grandfather was a great grandfather was just moving into this .
and a word totally  UNK  out of afghanistan , he was a girl in afghanistan , his daughter came to school , and so he was rejected by him .
my mother &apos;s education mother &apos;s education .
she goes .
she  UNK  two years ago to use our house for a girl to open school for girls in their neighbors .
and this is my father was the first man in his family &apos;s education .
it &apos;s not that his children will be education , including the daughter of the taliban , and despite the danger .
for him , the females are not greater than risk .
but in the taliban , i remember that there were moments when i was very angry about our lives and fear .
i &apos;d love to quit school , but my dad would say , &quot; listen , you can hear this , &quot; i can lose everything in this life .
the money can be taken away from the war .
but a second will remain forever , and if this is something we have to have , and if you have to pay the money to learn .
so what else do we want to go on ?
today i &apos;m 22 .
i was growing up in a country where a prisoner of war .
less than six percent of the old age of high school , and if i didn &apos;t commit my family , i was not to be one of them .
but , it &apos;s a great college professor .
when i went back to afghanistan , my grandfather were terrified family , because his daughter was in his education , was one of the first person in my life .
he could not only paint with my first professor , but also i was the first woman , and i could give the first women in kabul .
my family was belief .
i dream big , but my family was dreaming about my family .
so i &apos;m the global ambassador  UNK  , this is global educational campaign to women education .
so i helped to build the first school , and the only place for girls in afghanistan in a country that &apos;s danger to the girls in schools .
i &apos;m excited to be able to see my school with me to embrace this opportunity .
and i saw their parents and their father , and my father , supported and even as opposed to , despite having a lot of difficulty .
as he is ahmed . his name was his name , and i couldn &apos;t miss his tooth , but he is his students .
less than a month , he and his daughter was on the road , and they were actually killed , and they were literally killed for a few minutes .
when he was just home , i had a mobile phone voice , he kept going to keep giving him a daughter next time , they will again .
and he said , &quot; if people want to kill me , but i &apos;m not going to destroy my daughter and the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the &quot; and the paradox of the  UNK  . &quot;
now i &apos;ve noticed about afghanistan , and this is the fifth western common message in western , is that most people are behind us to value a parent and respect to their own culture , and the success of my daughter , like their own success .
this is not an important parent in our success .
in fact , they were the first people and the way to convince the future of the circumstances , but in the circumstances of afghanistan , we need to support the men of the men .
under the taliban , there are also hundreds of thousands of people who remember , that &apos;s illegal .
but today , over three million girls in afghanistan are in afghanistan .
afghanistan &apos;s really different from the united states .
i found that americans who see fragile , vulnerable in the wife .
i &apos;m afraid that all these changes aren &apos;t going to linger on the u.s. military .
but when i went back to afghanistan , when i was in my school and parents , they encouraged me to see a future , i see a promise of the future .
for me , afghanistan was one of the country , the possibility of a limitation , and every day it reminds me of that .
as i had a big dream .
thank you .
hello . this is my mobile phone .
a mobile phone can change your life , and a cell phone also gives you the freedom of your expression .
with a mobile phone , you can take a picture of human rights in syria .
with a mobile phone , you can also post a message on the board and start to get involved in a protests in egypt .
and also with a smartphone that you can pick a song up a song , it up and suddenly become famous .
but it &apos;s all possible to your cell phone .
i was a child in 1984 , and i live in berlin .
let &apos;s go back at that moment .
you can see here how the thousands of people stood up for and protests and for change .
it &apos;s the rain in 1989 , and imagine the people who have been trying to stand up for change in your cell phone .
anyone in this room ?
let &apos;s get it up .
now your phones on your phones , let &apos;s put your cell phone on your phones !
let &apos;s take it up . an android . oh , wow .
a lot of these days . we have a cell phone .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about my phone , and about how it changed my life .
i &apos;m going to talk about that .
there &apos;s about teaching information .
UNK  information .
but why is that information there ?
the reason it was invented in 2006 alone , there was a european commission .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
this instructions shows that every single person in europe , every single internet service provider have to have , has have to have a tremendous amount of information .
who &apos;s what someone called anybody who sent it to someone who sent it someone else ?
who sent it to anybody who messages ?
and if you use your mobile phones , this is where the problem is .
all of this information has stored at least six months after i was at least two years because you &apos;re using the internet or service provider .
and all over europe , the people were standing up and said , &quot; we don &apos;t want to say , &quot; no . &quot;
they said , we don &apos;t want to store this information .
we want to have the autonomy in the age of digital technology , and we didn &apos;t want the internet and service providers .
they are lawyers , journalists and fish , and fish , all said , &quot; we don &apos;t want to say , &quot; we don &apos;t like that . &quot;
and you can see here , just like tens of thousands of people joined the road in berlin , and they said , &quot; no fear . &quot;
and some people even say , it &apos;s like  UNK  .
UNK  is the police service in germany .
i &apos;ve also been wondering , how does it work ?
could they record the entire information ?
every time we use our mobile phones ?
so i asked my own house to carry , using telecommunications service providers , they had the largest service provider , and i asked them to do it , and i asked them to please send the entire information that they were stored .
i asked them to ask them to me for a time , and i kept going on asking , but what i &apos;m just going to get a clear answer .
but then i said , i &apos;d like to have this information , because they &apos;re living in my life .
and i decided i would send a massive lawsuit , because i want to get this information .
but  UNK   UNK  said , no , we won &apos;t provide you with this information .
and finally , i had a deal with a deal with them .
i &apos;m going to canceled , and they will provide me with the information request .
because at that point , the federal constitution of the european state agency had a very effective  UNK  in the european allies .
so i got this  UNK  in an envelope with a  UNK  with a cd of the plate inside .
and on the cds across there , i &apos;ve got it .
UNK  information .
first i looked at it , and i said , it &apos;s a big data .
but then i realized , this is my entire life .
this is my life in six months later , was recorded entire file in this record .
then i had a little wondered , what should i do with it ?
because i can see the places i went to sleep , i went to sleep every night .
but then i said , i &apos;d like to open this information .
i wanted it to be known by the public .
because i want to show people to see how real data is .
so for  UNK  and the open source and data , i do the same thing .
so these are visual images of my life in six months .
you can zoom in , you can either turn it upside down .
you can see my step .
you can even know how i was able to train by how i &apos;m going to train , and the frequency between those two places .
it &apos;s all possible with these information .
i &apos;ve got a little bit terrified .
but that information is not about me .
it &apos;s about all of us .
first , it &apos;s just like this , i called my wife leslie wife , and she also called me , for three times four , five to three times .
and then there &apos;s a couple of friends of mine called them .
you later , you call it , and you call your network , and you &apos;ll get this huge network .
but you can see how we interact with each other , they call each other , when they sleep .
you can see all of that .
you can see the most essential part of the grassroots , like leaders .
if you have access to this information , you can see how it works .
if you have access to this information , you can control all of society .
this is a drawing made of a national drawings or china .
this is a drawing of how a whole survey society is because you know what someone who had sent to the email , everybody else who sent it .
and this information is stored in at least in the european context for two years .
as i said , when i started to imagine these people from the berlin wall in the streets in the berlin .
maybe the  UNK  who will get involved in this protests , and if you know who &apos;s standing behind it , maybe it will never be able to come out .
the berlin wall of berlin could berlin wall .
and if that , maybe the collapse of the  UNK  in the cold war is also going to be there .
because nowadays ,  UNK  and companies want to capture the information that we have , and the more we &apos;re going to be online and fish .
they want to be able to follow up a new life , and that record them up with these information .
the freedom and living in the age of digital technology , not afraid of conflict .
what you should do is to fight for your freedom today .
and you have to stop fighting it for every day .
and then , when you go back home , tell you that your privacy is a true value of a 21st-century privacy , and that &apos;s not obsolete .
when you go back home , tell your sister who &apos;s represented by the companies and can capture that information and record them , even though they don &apos;t necessarily have to do it .
and if you don &apos;t trust me , please provide the information that they have storage .
so in the future , every time you use your cellphone to remind you to remind you to remind you that you have to fight for an evil in this case .
thank you .
photography is my passion for me since i have a big enough to capture , but i want to share with you today , but i want to share 15 , and i appreciate what none of that .
there &apos;s no art director , without a form , no , no one , even more interested in light .
in fact , most of them were taken by accidental , but even passing by chance .
the story starts when i went to new york city in new york city and my wife was clinging to my first daughter &apos;s birthday .
we happen to be in new york next year , so we decided to take another shot .
you can see the story leads to the head .
when i &apos;m going to get my third daughter , my wife said , &quot; my wife said , &quot; why don &apos;t you have to travel to a daughter and daughters , and daughters were just traveling ? &quot;
since then we started to cross the street taking a picture .
you know , your hand , you know , a total stranger on the worldwide extension of the world .
no one has rejected no one who has been blessed with us , with cameras .
so , we didn &apos;t know how it was going to change our lives .
it became very sacred .
this was taken after a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and i tried to explain what happened to the next five year-old ones could understand .
these pictures are not only objects that represent a given moment , or a particular moment .
they &apos;re the way to spend our time in a week , in october , thinking about our own time , and we &apos;re not only physical , just about the physical eye .
because even though we take a picture of our view , the changes of my life , and i was achieved new perspectives , and i got my life through eyes , and i looked at her eyes , and i looked at her life .
about the time we spent focusing on this one thing is that we value for the year .
recently , in a journey , we moved on a walk , and we were suddenly used to stop this kind of floral pattern , and it just kind of like the  UNK  in the early days before we had .
she showed her a sense of how she was five years old , when it &apos;s standing there .
it says that she found it out of the shops , when it picked up the first time to see it for nine years .
and now the things that it &apos;s in new york university , because it &apos;s decided to go to school in new york .
and i realized : one of the most important things that we create our experiences .
so i want to share the idea of being active in creating a memory .
i don &apos;t know how you go out there , but i don &apos;t do a lot of these pictures of your family .
i &apos;m always a guy .
so today i &apos;d like to encourage everybody to take this photograph , and let me take this step back to me and ask someone , &quot; do you take a picture ? &quot;
thank you .
i never forget the messages i used to my grandmother died in the country : &quot; hey ,  UNK  , fight or against him .
but never make a form of a kind of  UNK  revolution . &quot;
two years from the earlier when it came from the libya , it was energized alive , alive were encouraged by the new york  UNK  on tunisia and egypt .
i joined forces in the forces in libya and beyond the  UNK  for the first day to originate .
and that was a great revolution .
the man was on the front line of the authorities , but this is about the  UNK  of social justice .
they had a mirror image of the gut , with authoritarian  UNK  brutality .
they &apos;ve been able to see a partnership for east to the west and  UNK  to the south .
finally , six months after six months of war , i mean to 50,000 people who had managed to liberate the country and their country .
however ,  UNK  the burden of delivering , a legacy of  UNK  , corruption and the  UNK  of corruption .
for four centuries , the brutal beating of culture and infrastructure as the culture of the infrastructure of civic virtue .
the perception and the destruction of the challenges of me , as many women of the civil society in  UNK  civil society , called the  UNK  transition and democracy .
almost 200 institutions were established in the  UNK  during the collapse and soon after 300 days collapse .
after the 33 years of dark , i went back to the  UNK  , i started to operate in the classroom ,  UNK  competence .
also a great group of women , i created a  UNK  peace activist from the women , leaders of the civil society , which was given to the lobbyists in the dynamics for women to build the political rights movement and women to build the rights movement for women and democracy .
i was in a very difficult situation for which to hold up an environment , dominated by the environment , by a party and dominance .
i led a protest from the indian initiative to take the lobbied for a lesson to vote for more than the election cycle , where they could come from every citizen rights , although they went to vote for their election , and the most important political regulations for the year , for the political and took place in their list for women .
finally , our innovation has come together .
women in december 28 percent of congress in the state of the first election in the last few years .
however , every little bit by a little bit of excitement , from the elections of the general revolution -- once every day we wake up in the day .
one day we  UNK  with the old sufi poet and  UNK  and  UNK  .
every day we wake up in the wake of the american ambassadors .
on the other day we wake up with the assassinations .
and every day , every day we wake up the state of the  UNK  people ,  UNK  were equally prisoners of people as they were equally respected .
our society , we held up by hand , becomes more innovative and pushed aside , from the ideals of our freedom , our identities , our society , ours at the same time .
the  UNK  is not to get rid of the symbol of the year .
i &apos;m not trying to inspire you to tell the story of success in creating a list of creating and elections .
so i &apos;m here to admit that the whole country has made a mistake , made choice .
we didn &apos;t prioritize .
because those election returns to the election , stability peacekeepers .
is the list the kind of  UNK  between the candidates for years and women and girls ?
no , no .
so what is it helped ?
why do we continue to be a social norm , but because of the political party and dominance ?
missing the shortcomings of the girl &apos;s drawing of women , but it &apos;s also about compassion , tolerance , which is about compassion and tolerance .
our society needs a national conversation , we need to bring more powers to bring together , more than just to do the election , just tearing out .
our society needed those qualities that are more than women than the numbers of women and numbers on the population .
we need to use things like kipp ; it &apos;s supporting the advocate  UNK  .
we need to act like the compassion of compassion and .
we need to develop a conversation that would not only be rewarded , not for the honor , rather , rather than not to write .
this is the necessary ideas that need for a country that was like the war for participation .
because it &apos;s as a needle , it needs to require a sense of isolation , the between the women and men .
that &apos;s a really  UNK  .
and we need to be setting up the incentive to make society .
according to a poem in the koran &quot; -- peace is god -- &quot; which is god of compassion from god . &quot;
and then from &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is known in the tradition of abraham , which is a common root &quot; versus &quot;  UNK  -- the expression of men -- women express themselves as a  UNK  man , where men and women from the tribe , where men and women are born , new tribe , which was born . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and because the embryo is definitely growing in the embryo , it is essentially  UNK  , the whole  UNK  of life .
so we &apos;re taught that &quot; tolerance &quot; our conversation with everything . &quot;
so we &apos;re taught that &quot; tolerance &quot; our champion . &quot;
he gave us all of our grace &apos;s body .
thank you .
five years ago , i was an fairy tale that was a little bit like alice in a dime .
the campus lab was required , a teacher told me to communicate with a technical undergraduate course .
i was scared .
it was really afraid . the students ,  UNK  books and strange words .
but when i opened the exchange , i had experienced that i experienced as well , as she went through the bones and discovered a new layer of a new world .
this is just what i felt when i was an experienced before i was amazed at their ideas .
i believe that the key to door opened the door is the ability to communicate well .
we &apos;re incredibly important to communicate with scientists and engineers to change the world .
and the engineers are the people who are dealing with the biggest challenge of the energy from the environment , and there &apos;s also a lot of energy , and we don &apos;t know , and it &apos;s not going to do it , and i &apos;m going to take the position of the audience .
but the effective discussions of exchange can happen if scientists and engineers all of our engineers and not juicy stuff .
ask the scientists and engineers ,  UNK  , eight or a  UNK  .
i &apos;d like to share some key art so that we can see the science of his paper , it was very hot , very attractive , very hot , very attractive to find fascinating .
the first question is : what is it ?
why science is related to us .
don &apos;t just tell you that the bone tissue , where the research bone is peppered with his tongue , it &apos;s like the nets , because we need to understand the bone disease and treatment is  UNK  .
when science described , careful with term .
the term that we understand the concept of his idea .
probably said , &quot;  UNK  and &quot; but why not use time and doing time and doing time . &quot;
i do my idea is not  UNK  .
instead , as you can see , he said , &quot; the things that &apos;s possible .
clearly , you can talk about the science without ideas .
so paying attention to what , for example , and that &apos;s how appealing to the things that keeps us engaged .
and when you present , the correct usage labels .
have you ever asked yourselves why they called &quot;  UNK  ?
when you get your name ? well , you &apos;re going to kill off ! and they &apos;re going to kill your lecture .
so one slide is like this , not only that is too boring , but it makes us tick .
instead , looking at this slide of my clicker , which is really much more powerful , which is so potent that it becomes so potent that it &apos;s really inspirational to design the unique day .
and the cat is the  UNK  used to be easy and read the audience based on it , but if they don &apos;t use it to help us figure out how to help us understand .
i think this is just a couple of key things that we &apos;ve found out of the technology of science and technology .
but engineers also work also taught me to travel to  UNK  everything . so i wanted to summarize .
&quot; take the course of science , except for &quot;  UNK  , &quot; and then divided it &quot; for the word &quot; synecdochically &quot; , &quot; to find the audience , &quot; for the audience , &quot; you &apos;re going to do it for your job , to be an interactive result , where you &apos;re going to be fantastic interaction .
and so , scientists asked the engineers and scientists , and engineers solving the old equations , every single equation , or tell me .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m about russell , and in the short period of time , i am a model .
in fact , in 10 years .
and i felt that i had a pressure in the room right now because i shouldn &apos;t be wearing this dress .
luckily i follow along with a suit .
this is the first time someone else instead of ted , so i think you &apos;re very fortunate to witness this .
if a couple of women are scared when i &apos;m not saying , you don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going to know , but i &apos;m just going to know .
i realized that i was very lucky enough to change what you think about 10 in the paper .
it &apos;s not everybody has the opportunity to do this .
this high school paper is uncomfortable , i &apos;m not going to take them .
the worst part of this is in your hand , because the end of the day , so what i &apos;m doing when i &apos;m in my head .
all right .
why do i do that ?
it &apos;s odd .
in fact , hopefully it &apos;s not going to be so  UNK  .
the image is very powerful , but it &apos;s also very  UNK  .
i just had just absolutely nothing to do about six seconds .
and in this photo , actually , i haven &apos;t had my life in real life .
i feel very uncomfortable here at this moment , and i &apos;m bending my  UNK  , and i got bending my hair .
and of course , except for surgery , or it &apos;s a  UNK  that i have two days to photographs that we can do so little things that we can do to change our appearance , and it &apos;s very difficult to take it , although it &apos;s very difficult to have a huge impact on our lives .
so today , i &apos;m not going to be true , no means to be honest .
and i &apos;m standing on this stage because i &apos;m a model .
i &apos;m standing on the stage in this beautiful woman , and in a white group , and we call a sexy piece of paper .
and i &apos;m going to answer those questions that everybody always asks me to be honest with .
the first question is , how am i a model ?
and i &apos;m always saying , &quot; oh , well , but it doesn &apos;t matter what it means .
actually i become a model because i won the lottery , and i &apos;m noticing the winners , and you may be interested in the legacy words .
but in the last decade , we &apos;ve definition of beauty , and the balance that we look and the beauty that we &apos;re in molecular and  UNK  , but also the height of the color and the secrets .
this is what &apos;s the legacy that should be used to my legacy that i can make money .
i know that there are some people in this slide , and maybe there &apos;s a certain pattern . &quot;
i want to praise with my kids who want to be really remarkable .
but unfortunately , i have to show you a year in 2007 , a ph.d. student in new york who was at the university of new york and  UNK  models , and in  UNK  , and only 27 percent of people , less than four percent .
the next question that everybody always asks me : &quot; am i a big model ? &quot;
and my first answer is : &quot; i don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not just in recruitment fees . &quot;
but the next answer that i really want to tell the girls : &quot; why is it ? &quot;
you know ? they can be anyone .
you can become president united states or an american invention , or a internet , or a heart disease followed by a cardiologist , an excellent  UNK  , which is wonderful , because they &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re an interesting list , i said , &quot; no , no , no , no , no , i want to be a model , &quot; and i &apos;m going to go to your boss . &quot;
because it &apos;s not only powerful , you can also be the editor of the  UNK  in the united states or an r &amp; amp ;  UNK  , or steven  UNK  .
she said that you want to be a model where i grew up like a lottery when they grow up .
it &apos;s out of control , and it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a career path .
i &apos;m going to prove to you -- 10 years of experience as a model , because it &apos;s been done , it doesn &apos;t look for a surgeon .
if you &apos;re standing here to the light here , it &apos;s like a beautiful user interface , and when he said , &quot; we want to do this picture , &quot; so that he &apos;s walk up , &quot; and so this is beautiful , let &apos;s just go back to the top of the  UNK  , and then you just go back to a little bit , and then you just go back to the little bit of that , and then you can just go back to the end up , &quot; and then you can
it looks like this .
hopefully it &apos;s a little more  UNK  at the center of the middle .
i don &apos;t know what happens in that moment .
unfortunately , when you learn to finish your job , you &apos;re done a couple of things , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , because if you want to be the united states , you want to say , &quot; you know , you &apos;re going to be looking back at it .
the next question that people always ask me : &quot; are you all the pictures that were correct ? &quot;
so , it &apos;s almost like all the images were allowed to edit , but it &apos;s just one small element of those things that are happening .
this is one of the first photos i used to photograph , and it was the first time i took that picture , and i didn &apos;t even have a standard cycle .
i know that we &apos;re moving into the personal stories , but i was a little girl .
this is my external act , i photographed her before a few months .
this is me one day in the picture .
my friend was mine .
this is what i &apos;m going to sleep a few days before i was taking pictures of france .
this is my life in the context of the magazine i spent in the times .
and this is me now .
i hope that you can see -- these pictures are not the images of my picture .
it &apos;s the images that are used , and it was built by a team of experts , but the professional group , the  UNK  paint , the professional  UNK  , and photographer who make the  UNK  , the  UNK  , and the people who produce the  UNK  , and they produce the most  UNK  , and they &apos;re not making .
the next question i was asked , &quot; what are you for free ? &quot;
i &apos;ve got a lot of high heels i didn &apos;t have never any exceptions , but things that i &apos;d get to get free stuff that i &apos;d get out there , and that i didn &apos;t want to be there .
i grew up in cambridge , and i went to the store , and i had taken them with free , and they had given me a free one .
when i was a teenager , i was sitting in a car , and she was a very scary one that we had pulled over , and we ended up , and all i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , i said , &quot; we can go . &quot;
i got these things that are free ; it &apos;s my external , not because i &apos;m willing to have people who are willing to spend on their appearance .
i live in new york , and over the last year , has 140 percent of the people , 86 percent of the black people , hispanic kids .
in new york , there &apos;s only a thousand black people , so therefore they &apos;re not a question , &quot; am i not being arrested ? &quot;
it &apos;s &quot; i &apos;m going to get caught ? &quot;
when i was preparing for this talk , i discovered that there was 13 by 13 percent of the united states , and at whose age 17 percent .
the last question that people ask me : &quot; how are the blood ? &quot;
i think that what they want to hear is , &quot; if you &apos;re a little bit more red hair , you &apos;re going to be happy and happy . &quot;
and when we were behind the scenes like this : we sort of answer this : something like .
&quot; it &apos;s great to travel , and work with creative people , inspirational and inspire . &quot;
and that &apos;s what that is true , but it &apos;s just another thing , because what we never said before , but before i never say before , &quot; i never say , &quot; before i said , &quot; i &apos;m not ever saying . &quot;
i was because i had to think of my own thoughts .
and have you ever wondered , &quot; if your thighs are more  UNK  and your hair , then i &apos;ll be happier ? &quot;
you just meet a group of our models , because they have their legs ,  UNK  hair  UNK  , and then they can make the most vulnerable people in the planet , and then where women are the educated on the planet .
when i wrote this poem , i was very difficult to find a balance , because in a face , i felt really uncomfortable , because i &apos;m not comfortable here to say , &quot; i &apos;m so fortunate enough to be human , and i &apos;m really excited to get annoyed me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m happy to get it . &quot;
but mainly it &apos;s very hard to take off the sexuality of the  UNK  and the subject &apos;s one of the greatest human race .
but i &apos;m also happy to honor it and i think it &apos;s the privilege of being fortunate enough to have been for me before the last 20 or 30 years , and i &apos;ve been working with my career , because when i was able to tell my own work , maybe it might be very important for me if i don &apos;t have any money on it may be very important .
if there &apos;s a whole discussion in this session , i hope , i hope is that it &apos;s all of us feel more comfortable .
thank you .
there &apos;s a lot of ways that people around us can improve our lives .
we don &apos;t get people around us , so there &apos;s a lot of public transportation , we know , even though we &apos;re shared public spaces .
so over the past few years , i &apos;m trying to share a lot of my neighbors , use a simple tool in public space , using simple as simple as paper and holes .
and these projects came from questions , like , i asked my neighbors , what my neighbor pays for their families ?
how do we leave our nations and want to be much smaller than the house ?
how do we share more of our collective memory , our experiences of our buildings , and we have much better understanding of our landscapes right ?
and how are we going to share our hopes of our lives , and in the shops , so that could reflect on our own basis ?
now , i live in new orleans , and i was in new orleans , orleans .
i &apos;m always being told by the  UNK  of the wolves that were were  UNK  , who were madly in love , and stories in love with hundreds of thousands of years , and i believe in cities .
i felt like every time someone  UNK  , new orleans .
there are some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has the largest number of ways in the united states .
i live to this house , and i think i can do it to become more beautiful , and i think of my community , and i also think about something that can change my life forever .
in 2009 , i lost my beloved .
her name is joan , and her mother was a mother , and the death of her surprise , and not surprisingly enough .
and i thought about death , and this has a lot of me , and this thing that really have me has come to me and have a clear thing that meant to me now .
but i struggled to keep this angle in my daily life .
i felt like it was easy to capture , and forget the day , and forgetting that it matters to you .
so with the help of the old people , and every one on my side of an abandoned that project into a big part of a giant patchwork across -- to fill it up with me before i die . &quot;
i don &apos;t know what to expect from this testing , but on the next day after the statue , and it was full of the walls , and so it goes on .
and i want to share some of the people on the wall .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to try to kill myself . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to be dead on my road international day . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i wanted to sing for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want one of the tree . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i &apos;d like to live outside . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to get a hug again . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i wanted to be somebody to  UNK  . &quot;
&quot; before i die , i want to be absolutely . &quot;
so this space has become a  UNK  , and create a space , but i hope that makes everyone laughing , and i started laughing , and comfort them during my lifetime , and solace in the cockroach notwithstanding .
it &apos;s about that you don &apos;t know you .
it &apos;s about people who understand around us , and becomes brilliant .
it &apos;s about to create a very  UNK  and to reflect what the idea is that what it means to us to grow up and change .
i did this project last year , and it started with hundreds of letters from the big , rather than a  UNK  community in the center of their communities , so my colleagues and i do , and i &apos;m now doing a wider picture of the people in the south africa , the new south african countries in australia , more south australia and more  UNK  .
together , we &apos;ve created public spaces that have the power of our public space has the power to be able to have a chance and to share a voice .
two most important things we have time and relationships with other people .
in the age of a vast age , this is more important than ever to figure out how to sustain a life and short , a little bit of compact ,  UNK  and a short of living .
death is something that we &apos;re often not encouraging to incentivize or even to say , but i think i &apos;m going to die , but i realize that death is one of the most powerful things that you can do .
think about the death of your life is clear .
but it &apos;s shared spaces that could be reflected in something that happens to us as individuals and as individuals and as a community , and to be a community , and to share the stories of the fears that people around us , we can only help them make better lives .
thank you .
thank you .
well , i &apos;m a mathematical application and here is a problem for anyone who &apos;s an app that &apos;s the same way .
nobody knows what we do .
so today i &apos;m going to try to explain what i &apos;m going to do .
well , dancing in one of the activities that you do .
we love dancers to dance and ballet slippers . you &apos;ll see it .
the ballet ticket is a junior high and high technology and high levels of the status of the genetic factors that relate to the genetic fudge factor .
unfortunately , mental disorders like parkinson &apos;s  UNK  has parkinson &apos;s disease , like this is something that &apos;s happening to me ,  UNK  , the ballet ticket buyer was  UNK  , was a ballet ticket .
throughout the last year has tremendous progress in the treatment .
however ,  UNK  million people worldwide who have diseases , and they have to live in their situation , in the  UNK  -- the prime minister of illness and no different applications .
we need an objective measure of progress , and finally , the only way we know that we actually have a treatment , which is that we can make sure we can get the answer .
but that &apos;s very frustrating , and they have parkinson &apos;s and they &apos;re  UNK  , and they &apos;re not very simple , so there &apos;s no simple method that you can do , and the best in this test .
you need to go to hospitals . it &apos;s very expensive to do it very , very costly , which is testing it , which is never done it .
but if the patient can do this ?
that will really be a domain of the aids clinic , and if the patient can do it ?
it &apos;s not the gold of the staff .
it &apos;s about 300 dollars , to do this partial  UNK  clinic .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest you is a way to suggest that we can achieve this , because you can see at least , as you can see , at least in a direction .
here we have a video of the back of the vocal chords .
this paper vocal chords , and we were talking about , and we can see ourselves as the dancers , because we have to coordinate all agencies , and when we actually make all the sound of the same genes in charge .
it was like the ballet .
i mean , i think , how long it takes a child to say .
from sound , we really can be impossible to follow the forest when the vibrating goes to be affected by parkinson &apos;s , because the sound has the same vibration .
so at the bottom , you can see an example of a rainforest of deforestation .
we see the symptoms .
we see , the shake of our  UNK  .
this  UNK  out there &apos;s much more like a little more time , and this is one of the symptoms .
these sound effects can actually detect , in some cases , but in some cases , with the digital tools and analyze the hardware store , and using the machine , which is possible that we can measure , lots of quantitative data to be able to tell someone &apos;s health in the body of the distance between the body and disease .
so how do these trials are based on this test voice as compared to both the expertise and tattoos ?
this experiment has no  UNK  . they &apos;re all using existing infrastructure .
you don &apos;t need to design a whole hospital admission an experiment to run this experiment .
and both of them are very precise , experimental .
that means it can be done .
fast , it takes about 30 seconds .
the cost , and we all know what &apos;s going to happen .
when something becomes extremely cheap , it becomes extremely cheap , it will spread across widespread .
so this is a great fear that i think we can do now .
we can make a difficult problem for patients .
it doesn &apos;t need to get to get aids clinics .
we can do the observation with high frequencies to get the data to aim at the data .
we can do a whole collection of mass  UNK  trials which are performing on which is possible for the first time .
we &apos;ve got the opportunity to start looking for biotechnology before it &apos;s too late before it .
so in order to make the first step towards this , we are making the way up the starting to make up the voice .
with  UNK  and  UNK  , we aim at the same time to record a number of large numbers on global data to gather and analyze the four big data sets off .
we have residents of the local access to a billion people on the planet .
anybody can be healthy or parkinson &apos;s maybe i could have parkinson &apos;s  UNK  and left , and it leaves a little coin , and i &apos;m really happy to say that we were really excited about eight hours .
thank you .
tom  UNK  : so max &apos;s  UNK  , has been sampled by 10,000 people &apos;s blood , you can tell someone who you can know who &apos;s going to be healthy ?
what are you going to conclude with these samples ?
max weber : yeah . it &apos;s going to be what &apos;s going to happen when you &apos;re clear .
you can see , some people might not do it .
but we &apos;re going to take a big data collection of data collected from all cases , and the results were in each other cases , because it &apos;s important to look at all of these things , and we were looking for real signal .
so what is the exact same 86 percent ?
more than that much more ink .
in fact , my students  UNK  , i had to praise wisely , because he did some great work , he had done some amazing work , he has been able to do this , and that this is able to do it , and this project that &apos;s 99 to the 99 percent of the 99 .
nine . well , a  UNK  .
so , that means that people will be able to call — people from their phones and do this test them , and they have parkinson &apos;s disease , and we can have parkinson &apos;s disease , and then they can get the doctors , and then they &apos;re going to get sick , and you can see their health .
exactly .
thank you very much .
thank you .
i live in a central area .
this is the area : mushrooms , fast , the wine shop ,  UNK  .
so the city planner goes together with each other , and they see what it means to bring it to the meaning of los angeles , so they &apos;re going to work in los angeles , and they &apos;re actually going to get really in the city .
this is the los angeles .
the wine shop ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
it &apos;s like  UNK  million americans , i lived in a desert in los angeles : a desert island , the home of los angeles , and it &apos;s going to run the inside of the hills and run .
what &apos;s interesting about the food on the side of the road is causing a lot of people to run away .
in los angeles , people are dying may not yet be curable .
for example , the obesity rate is higher than beverly hills in the beverly hills , where the hills are about 16 kilometers .
i saw this firsthand .
and i wondered , how do you feel bad food for health , when you &apos;re healthy for every time you have to see the bad impacts of our food system today ?
i saw a wheelchair was allowed to purchases .
i see the daycare centers as represented as much as starbucks .
and i realized that it was supposed to end .
i realized that the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and the food is also solution .
i &apos;m also tired of you have to get tired of how to rain gets you don &apos;t make a deep drug .
what i did was to do was in a food before .
it &apos;s a long time that we put a road in a walk .
it &apos;s a yards away , long .
the problem is , which is that of the city .
but you have to keep it .
so i thought , &quot; great . i can do it , because that &apos;s what i want to do . &quot;
and this is how i keep it in the soil .
i came together with my group , but the l.a. philharmonic of getting food and began to gather in the forest : you know , you eat fruit .
we &apos;re a team of  UNK  for sharing , which is many people from their lives , from each other in the city , and they &apos;re completely free .
and the garden is beautiful .
then he got complaining .
i saw the city , and i had sort of a garden , i had to break a garden .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; well , how ? &quot;
one order of the  UNK  on the ground floor that wouldn &apos;t even bother ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m brought here . &quot;
since this time , this is not going .
and the l.a. philharmonic pops in l.a. , steve  UNK  wrote an article about it , and you get it on the board .
we had been able to beat one in your hand .
the commissioner isn &apos;t even what i call them and said they were doing .
i mean , come on , why not ?
l.a. philharmonic orchestra in the united states of an american city that has ownership of land .
they own a kilometer .
the equivalent of 20 times , the park .
in order to make a million trees .
how can they be gay ?
in a tree weighs next to 1,000 seeds , then 10,000 seed .
when the amount of money comes to the equivalent of that would 75 dollars .
that &apos;s my faith , when i told people , from my own food , or from my own food .
in the food for the same way to print money .
i have a legacy of the  UNK  .
i grew up there . i raised my boys in there .
and i refuse to do a part of the reality that is created , which is created by some others , and i &apos;m creating my own reality .
i &apos;m an artist .
my artistic horizons continue to my work .
also , as a cartoonist , for the  UNK  , i ask for the  UNK  , me , about the  UNK  ,  UNK  me .
i use a garden , put in a plant , and some of the crops are what for me , and about the trees for me .
you &apos;d be surprised with what you can do if you make a couple of things .
you can &apos;t imagine what the great sunflower is , and they affect what people like .
so what happened ?
i saw my own garden of becoming a tool for an educational tool , a transformed into my land .
to change the community , you have to change the ground .
we are .
you &apos;re going to be surprised how kids are affected .
the work is the most challenging thing that you can possibly do , especially in the inner city .
and , you get the second half of the oil .
i remember one time , there was a mother , and my daughter was 10 , and i was about 30 : and i &apos;m in my garden .
i think , oh my god , i feel bad for them . and i said to them , and i said to them , you don &apos;t need to do it .
this garden is on the road in its path .
i feel embarrassed when you have to see people in my own life , and that &apos;s only the more reason to do this work . i &apos;m just asking people to do this . &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to steal from your food to jail ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; of course , i &apos;m not afraid to steal .
so they should be everywhere on the road .
the whole idea is .
i want them to take them , but at the same time , i want to get their health . &quot;
there was another one time when i was in the main street in los angeles .
there are guys , they helped me to get a truck from the trucks .
the air is happy , and they share the story of how strong they have influence the vegetables , and they used to her vegetables , with her mom , and it was great , and it was just a moment that changed .
so the green has continued to grow in a garden .
we &apos;ve got about 50 people i &apos;m in the  UNK  , and i &apos;m a voluntary .
if the kids in the curly fries , they eat  UNK  .
if they &apos;re in tomato , they &apos;re going to eat tomatoes .
but if no one tells them , if they don &apos;t see the effects of their own food , they can be blind , they would be blindly hoping for whatever .
i see the young people who want to work , but they &apos;re going to do something -- i see these young people that are destined to us .
with gardeners , i see an opportunity that can teach us four children with whose grandchildren .
and when we do that , who knows ?
maybe we &apos;re going to be born in washington .
but if we don &apos;t change the ground , we &apos;ll never do that .
this is one of my plans . this is what i want to do .
i want to be in a garden where everybody can share it .
i &apos;d like to take the names -- it gives them a cafe and its cafeteria .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
i &apos;m not talking about free stuff , because free .
what &apos;s interesting about sustainability , it &apos;s a non-sustainable course .
i &apos;m talking about jobs , and people get their kids out of the four and pulled them out of the street , proud of it to be proud of it to open for farmers , open for the farmers &apos; markets .
but what i want to do here , we &apos;ll make that sexy .
i want to be all of us to be a  UNK  , but gardeners varieties .
we &apos;re going to change the concept of  UNK  .
if you &apos;re not breathing -- it &apos;s not a  UNK  .
do the  UNK  with your friend , ok ?
and let &apos;s make it a choice .
basically , if you want to meet , you know , you want to fold , you don &apos;t want to be standing up in the comfortable seat  UNK  , you want to be comfortable and comfortable talking about it .
if you want to meet the garden with your  UNK   UNK   UNK  , and we &apos;ll be in a couple of things .
hi . thank you .
thank you .
this is where i live . i live in kenya .
behind me is my father , and behind my father , and behind the set of nairobi streets .
the national park didn &apos;t impose on the barrier across the south , which means that in the wildlife .
and so predators like lions , and after they do it , and this is what those lions do .
they killed our animals .
this is one of the cows have been killed in the morning , and when i wake up in the morning , i found it dead , and i felt it was very sad , because that &apos;s the only thing that we got there .
my community , the maasai , one guy , but we believe that we had a maasai and all of his legs , and all of us , but that &apos;s why we take them seriously .
so i grew up with the lions .
the fighters and the security guards , and we &apos;ve also worried about this problem .
so they kill lions .
this is one of the lions in nairobi has been killed in nairobi .
and i think this is the reason that the national park in nairobi .
every boy from my six to nine years old , my community is responsible for my leg , and i also kept my father , and i also had to do the same .
so i had to figure out how to fix this problem .
the first idea that i have is used to be silk , because i think of fire .
but then i realized that the silk doesn &apos;t actually work , because it doesn &apos;t even understand lions .
but i didn &apos;t let go on .
and the second idea is that i was using  UNK  .
i try to fool it , and try to think about it is me standing nearby .
the lions are very clever .
and i first saw the day and then they go back , and then they go back to the second day , and they &apos;re not always moving in there , it &apos;s not only there .
and then lions and wolves killed .
so one night , i held a ski lift around , put it on the next , but that particular lions came .
i discovered that the lions .
so i had an idea .
since i remember , i &apos;ve been working in my room , and i was even on my own radio , and i bought my mother &apos;s day , and i was nearly killed , but i &apos;d done it .
so i took a car -- an old car battery -- it &apos;s a car that &apos;s a little bit of a car , and it &apos;s a powerful thing that they want to help make a fun .
and i have a light-controlled &quot; switch off &quot; switch .
and that &apos;s a little light from a battery to the wife .
and i installed things .
as you can see , the battery , the solar cells used to fire -- and the battery power -- so i call it the power box .
and the clock does that switch off .
as you can see , these lights are pointing out , because that &apos;s the lion towards  UNK  .
and that &apos;s how the light goes on the side of the eye .
the  UNK  and the lions do it and make them think that i &apos;m walking around the bell , but actually i &apos;m asleep in my bed .
thank you .
i &apos;ve put it in my home two years ago , since we &apos;ve been there , we don &apos;t have any problem with lions .
our neighbors &apos; assumptions hear about this idea .
one of these are three people .
she has a lot of lions , and she asked me if i was able to help her fill up with  UNK  .
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
so i installed the light bulbs already . you can see , they &apos;re looking at the light bulbs .
for this , i helped seven to put their families in their communities , and they &apos;re all working .
now my idea is being used to be used throughout the communication , just as the hyena .
this invention , i &apos;ve been fortunate enough to have been a good school in the most schools in kenya , and i &apos;m excited to be excited about this .
my school is now that i &apos;m starting to donate my money and raising awareness .
and even i pasted my friends of mine , and we put our community , and we put these little lightbulbs and it sets up and they taught me how they have to put it in their way .
a year ago , i was just a little girl in the wake of the state , i was able to look at the aircraft , and i was able to tell you that one day i was sitting there , and i was sitting on the side of it .
and i &apos;m here today .
i had the chance to get here the plane by the first time to enter the ted plane .
my biggest dream was to be an engineer and a  UNK  airplane .
i hate lions , but now because the invention of my former self is saving lives , and we can live with leopard seals .
UNK   UNK   UNK  . it &apos;s my language , which means thank you very much .
i don &apos;t know it &apos;s really interesting to play with her story .
so i &apos;ve got a scholarship .
i &apos;m making those crazy inventions .
what &apos;s the list goes on the list ?
what about my invention is , would you want to do an electrical fence ?
you know it &apos;s crazy to get the invention of electricity , but i want to do his own .
i tried it , don &apos;t stand , and i used it before , but i had been washed up because the laundry for electrical power .
richard koshalek is over .
we &apos;re going to get the way out of your streets .
thank you very much . thank you .
what i do , and what i do about my life -- i was going to work in the seven years -- i was working in africa .
this was in 1977 -- i broke in my head -- that &apos;s not what i broke up in the zambia -- from the coast of zambia , somalia , picking up the coast of somalia , picking up the nations of western nations in africa .
i did it for ngos and get together in africa , and projects we created in africa .
i was very  UNK  .
every 21 , i think , people who are doing good at work and we &apos;re doing good at work in africa .
but instead , we kill the things that we &apos;re killing in .
the first project , which was inspired my first book , &quot; but my first life , &quot; from  UNK  , &quot; which is a project of zambia in a single person .
so we were zambia from the seeds that came from the country in italy in a beautiful valley to live , and we sit down to the  UNK  and the people in italian tomato .
and of course those native to be lost their loved ones , so we paid them , and sometimes they work .
we were really amazed at these native populations , like this is not one .
but instead of asking them not anything , we &apos;re simply not saying , &quot; wow , we haven &apos;t solved it . &quot;
&quot; just time to save the lives of zambia from the famine began . &quot;
and of course , everything in africa is good .
we &apos;ve got these incredible little tomato , in italy , a single nest colony , it &apos;s about this big zambia .
it &apos;s incredible , and we were talking to people peaceful zambia , there is no one to grow . &quot;
when those tomato go through those tomatoes , and there &apos;s nine stories , and there &apos;s only one night about 200 yards , where they live from the sky and clean up .
we tell the people of zambia , there are god , but there &apos;s  UNK  ! &quot;
and the people say , &quot; well , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t look at it . &quot;
&quot; why don &apos;t people tell us , &quot; do you have a little bit before you ever asked . &quot;
i thought there were only people who would do their own , but then i &apos;ll look at what the americans are doing , but he &apos;s doing what he is doing , and when i &apos;m doing what they &apos;re doing , and when i &apos;m somewhat proud of what i &apos;m here .
because , you see , it &apos;s just feeding us either fed up with a few kids .
you should look at something -- you should look at -- you should look at something that we &apos;ve already heard others .
you want to read the book , or read &quot; the aid worker , &quot; the murder of a woman , an economist  UNK  .
the book was published in 2009 .
well , we have these international aid , the african continent with two billion u.s. dollars in the last 50 years .
i &apos;m not going to tell you the amount of money that generated .
let &apos;s read her books .
i read it from a woman , but we did damage .
but the western message is that we are these  UNK   UNK  , and we are the  UNK  , and we just have a  UNK  , or in care other ways .
from two sources of an english language , &quot; which means &quot; doesn &apos;t make it . &quot;
those two different sides have different .
the helmet is integral to the human being from any other cultures , and they were like me . &quot; i love them . &quot;
in care , i am with all the cultures , from their culture .
that &apos;s why the white people in africa called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i &apos;m like , i &apos;ve lost my book , &quot; beautiful , &quot; but it &apos;s beautiful , &quot; written by  UNK  , above all else , leaving the economic growth , if we don &apos;t need help others .
so this is the first principle of aid .
the very first aid is respect to aid .
this morning , the organization put this together a tree in a  UNK  , and said , &quot; can we imagine a city -- could it be a  UNK  city ? &quot;
when i was , i decided i was just responding to each other , and i created a system called  UNK  , where you &apos;re not going to be anywhere near , who you can never become a good driver .
so what do you do -- your mouth shut down .
never come to a community with these ideas , you sit with those people .
we didn &apos;t work from the office .
we met at the coffee bars .
we don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
and what we do is to be friends , and figure out what that people wanted to do .
the most important part .
you can give someone an idea .
if you don &apos;t want to do that , then how do you do it ?
the aspiration of women have to have the development of self is the most important thing .
the aspiration of men have to have the growth of the most important thing .
and we do the search for knowing , because of the world , no one can be successful .
the idea of god has been an understanding , but there is always understanding .
so many years ago , i had this idea : why don &apos;t we just go to a community , instead of a community , and tell them , and where they don &apos;t do , but why don &apos;t we listen to them ?
let me tell you a secret .
there &apos;s still one of the community meetings .
but they never have any entrepreneur , and they don &apos;t tell you , and they don &apos;t want to work with their money , what they want to do with their money .
so this planner has a blind spot .
but the most wise person in shipping container is never knowing that they won &apos;t come to the community .
what we do is work for a team -- and one thing to do it , you have to create a structure that doesn &apos;t exist .
you have to create a new disciplines .
a multidisciplinary family , like a doctor &apos;s family for business , doctors , who work for business , the people in your home , you have a friend in your kitchen counter , and you can help figure out how to make your local aspirations .
i started as an experiment in  UNK  , australia .
i &apos;m in a fashion at that point , trying to get away from the way to get away from the protection and tell you what to do .
so what i did for the first year in  UNK   UNK  , and in three days , and three days i &apos;d been making a ham in a construction business , and he called me a fish restaurant , and help me to make a fish restaurant , and he  UNK  jobs , and then he found a job , and he managed to get a fish to the restaurant , huh ?
and i helped the fisherman it &apos;s working on the same way you do things , and you have on the  UNK  of the  UNK  plant , but we &apos;re eating bluefin tuna by the way that sushi bar to do with the next 15 dollar , and then we would look for the farmers , and he said , &quot; do you can help us to protect ourselves ? &quot;
in one year , i have 27 and the people of the government project , &quot; how did you do ?
how do you do it ? &quot; and i said , &quot; i did a very hard job .
i mouths , and listen to his mouth . &quot;
so -- so -- so the government said to me , &quot; keep going on . &quot;
we did that 300 communities across the world .
we &apos;ve started to launch a career .
there &apos;s a people who are weakened writing because i was isolated .
peter  UNK  , one of the great mentor in history , in the history of a few years ago .
peter  UNK  is a professor before the philosophy were involved in business , and here &apos;s the thing that peter  UNK  says , &quot; really don &apos;t match a business and an economy . &quot;
the planning goes on the arts .
so right now you &apos;re in the united states now is over the most people who didn &apos;t want to know what to do with ?
you have to learn how to get these people to talk to you .
you have to take them to security , privacy , and you really have to do it , and they would be excited to help me along .
with a 10,000 communities , we could have about 200 of us .
can you imagine a  UNK  community , which is about 400,000 people and aspirations ?
what &apos;s the best lecture ?
the indigenous peoples , those who are the ones who applause . you applause .
so what i &apos;m talking about is the spirit of the spiritual is present .
we &apos;re at the final stages of the industrial revolution -- with the fuel supply of the fuel industry ; it can &apos;t replicate , but we have a sustainable system , but we &apos;re not sustainable systems .
the internal combustion engine .
the way to store the things that aren &apos;t sustainable .
what we have to look at us is how we do , to cultivate this perspective , education , communication and seven billion people in a sustainable way .
there &apos;s no technology .
who will come up with the technology revolution ?
governments !
it &apos;s going to be  UNK  , and they &apos;re doing right now .
there &apos;s a very happy story that i read in a magazine called  UNK  for many years in front of a magazine .
there &apos;s a group of experts to come in new york city for the future year .
and in  UNK  , the team came together , and the conjecture that will happen to the conjecture that will happen for the next hundred years , and consensus and headed for a hundred years : it won &apos;t be 100 years .
why ? because they look at the curve and say , if we just keep the growing population like this size of the new york city has to move millions of people in new york city , and from the horse to six million brain , and the horse is not going to have six million brain .
they &apos;re going to be  UNK  in the horse .
so in the year  UNK  , they saw this technology that made for life in new york city .
so what happened in the next 40 years ? in the united states , at the time in the united states --  UNK  car .
the idea of finding a technology has completely wiped out all the factories , and that are very small , that may have a very  UNK  situation .
UNK  , henry . he was henry ford .
however , there &apos;s a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
first of all , you have to bring them to security .
no , they wouldn &apos;t look for you .
and then you have to give them an absolute service , and it &apos;s distinct .
and then you have to tell them about the truth .
the best company , the largest company , it has got to do three great things : you have to be on the top of you have to do with the  UNK  , and you have on the top of the management .
think about it ?
we never met an individual in the world , who has just been able to do it , and you run it at the same time .
that doesn &apos;t exist .
this character has never been born .
we did an extensive research , and we looked at the top of the world , ford ,  UNK  , everything , yahoo , they &apos;re all google .
there &apos;s only one thing that every one of the whole world has only one thing to do : it &apos;s not only one person who starts with one person .
now we &apos;ve been teaching about the juvenile  UNK  , our  UNK  , we launched the first two packets of a  UNK  , and for richard  UNK  , and the age of those kids in ages , and the first two pages of a  UNK  richard  UNK   UNK  , &quot; and how many times he used to use &quot; and for the first time he used to use . &quot;
never ever since i have , &quot; and from &quot; we &apos;ve got 32 times , &quot; we &apos;ve got 32 times . &quot;
he didn &apos;t start alone .
no one started alone . no one .
so we can create a community where there are some people who have the experience of the expertise in the scale , and you &apos;d sit on the scale of the back of the bars , and you &apos;re going to do it for someone who &apos;s saying , &quot; hey , you &apos;re going to talk about somebody who says , &quot; what do you need to do ? &quot;
what can you do ? do you do it ?
okay , can you sell it ? you can manage money ?
&quot; oh , no , i can &apos;t do this . &quot; do you want to find somebody else ? &quot;
we activate those communities .
we have teams of volunteers who volunteered for their resources to help them find resources and humans and find ourselves that the wisdom of the intelligence itself as a challenge as a challenge as a culture of challenge as a challenge of this culture , and aspiration to only by the role of the energy of the imagination of the lift , and the energy of the people of their imaginations of their own imagination .
thank you .
until 2011 , three months , i made the image of the city in new york city .
we are  UNK  creatures ,  UNK  creatures .
hidden in the dark room , and he says they &apos;re the sun .
we are the people who are more beautiful , more beautiful , it can &apos;t make any sense of criticism , and get messages from the press , but we also have a lot of knowledge and professional artist with us and experience .
in november , 2011 , watching the world , watching a tragic event in a tragic event that happened in japan .
and then , by volunteer , i got in a few days , in the scene of the crime scene .
i also , hundreds of volunteers who are just sitting still at home , so i couldn &apos;t join them .
on december 13 , i got five to  UNK  town .
it was a very small bottle of  UNK  , with 50,000 people , a  UNK  of the first people in the first place to be influenced by the first tsunami .
the water goes to the ground over 24 meters , and over the three meters of land .
there is a picture of town that has been broken .
we pull the fragments ,  UNK  channels ,  UNK  .
clean sanitation , toilets and sanitation , ready for rehabilitation .
we cleaned up the ton of either  UNK  , both locally .
we  UNK  , but everybody &apos;s fun .
in a lot of weeks , volunteers and the search for a whole thing .
they &apos;re looking for pictures and the camera and he can  UNK  the camera and his  UNK  .
all of that .
they collected  UNK  and they gathered all around the  UNK  places where they keep  UNK  around .
not at the point that i realized that these photographs were not true of an individual loss .
when i flee to live , to keep their lives , they took all the life back , everything left behind .
on the weekend in there , i went to a  UNK  center .
i &apos;m keeping the public , a bathtub with the shower .
this is also where the trauma centers have been collecting  UNK  .
this is where people say  UNK  , and that day i &apos;m glad to honor them , because they allowed me to help them for a book .
it &apos;s really emotional . i said , okay , i &apos;m going to think , but when i really experience it was only possible .
when i looked through the pictures , there are some more than a hundred years old , some of my  UNK  inside the room , i was thinking , i was one of myself , i was able to paint it , and i was able to know , and i &apos;m able to do it .
so i went there , i clicked on facebook , and a few people , and i was so much positive feedback , i knew i had to shake hands .
we &apos;re starting with these photos .
this is the first one .
it &apos;s not very severe  UNK  that  UNK  for the face of the country , to be repair that and the very high line .
if not , in a little girl looked like that , and i &apos;m not going to be sure that &apos;s bad enough . so that &apos;s broken .
over time , a lot of clouds , you know , and we need to add people to edit , and you know , again , travel , facebook , and linkedin , and in clouds , and , and in the next 80 years , and i wanted to help other countries .
within two weeks , i had 150 people who wanted to join .
on july , for july , we opened up the town of its neighborhood , far north , far more than  UNK  town .
every week , we launch a new device that we looked at the temporary library , to get the people to get their letter to the photos .
the older women sometimes have never seen before , after 10 minutes , looking for a photograph of our eyes , to give us a server , in a stream , in a server , in the clouds , in a  UNK  place , somewhere in the world .
spend time off the building block is a whole different story , and obviously depends on your feet , and it depends on your feet .
maybe it takes an hour .
maybe it took months .
this image in this photograph is almost likely to be solved by hand or  UNK  , or  UNK  , from the colors , and the other parts of the  UNK  and the damage .
it takes time .
now , all these images have been hurt themselves , damaged water in the brine that &apos;s  UNK  water , because at times , it &apos;s been  UNK  for entire oil , during the entire period of time , so they &apos;re going to have a long time , so they &apos;re longer clean .
we can &apos;t fix it , if you don &apos;t do it , dry and it &apos;s dry .
we were tough lucky with my hands .
there &apos;s a great mentor mothers .
it &apos;s very easy enough for some damage to these deceased .
my team leader once said : it &apos;s like a tattoo .
you don &apos;t make mistakes .
the women gave us this tough luck , when they were able to get recovered .
she had a long time ago , and i realized that they were doing it was broken .
there &apos;s also a replica of this picture .
if not , husbands can drag and her face , there &apos;s no face , maybe they &apos;ll just put it together in a picture of a photograph and do it again .
when we got these photos from us , she shared her story .
these photos of her colleagues have found her husband in a firefighter , between the fire on the track , which has a long way to have a long term .
on the tsunami , the  UNK  of the foot of the legs .
he had to go about the water in the alarm of the siren .
two of my sons , no longer remember , the two children &apos;s sons were in school , both schools .
one ended up being stuck in the water .
it took a week , and they found out that they all had survived .
and i gave her the youngest son of her son of youngest son who had 14 .
for that , after all of these pictures , these are the perfect gift of him , something that he could be perfect for it , so that it may be frightening to be  UNK  , to be  UNK  days when it turned out to be broken .
six months later in japan , volunteer ,  UNK  organized in all , organized in a hundred thousand volunteers , who have been a cleaner than a picture , — — — — and most of you were great . this is important .
over the next hundred volunteers have helped more than 90 families , hundreds of them have been returned to the picture .
in this time , we were not just a thousand dollars and a device for most , and the cost of the printer .
we took pictures .
each image of a reminded someone or something , someone something , a new one said , one of a loved one person .
they are memories of the record , and we are the final memories of  UNK  , and we &apos;re also getting back to the first record .
that &apos;s the point of this whole project , which is the bits of human beings bring back to the connections .
when you take a picture like this , it &apos;s going to be able to make a big transformation in the lives of people .
it &apos;s also a big difference in your life .
for some people , they were connected to something with something , to something , which is a big part of your ear , which is something other than our  UNK  and other model .
i want to read an email from this session . after this email from the  UNK  , who came back to the milk .
&quot; when i work , i don &apos;t think about  UNK  and stories in the photographs .
there &apos;s a photo , it &apos;s a woman in a generation , from a young lady , i came together with my home from my house , because my mother had a similar photo , my mother , i was born , and my daughter was born , every little girl on the wall .
on the globe , whatever the basic age , the basic needs of our place , right ? &quot;
thank you .
i was in the back of  UNK  fan mail in ghana .
the air is solid dense and a little bit , and it was an sob , in trouble .
i can feel a  UNK  from the body of a  UNK  , which is over the dark , but there &apos;s nothing more about .
i hear speak english , but they are almost the  UNK  of their laughter and they managed to get  UNK  stuff .
as people , i put a  UNK  on top of a cheap , it &apos;s got close down to the rubber , i couldn &apos;t see the kind of  UNK  , i was able to sustaining them on the ground .
when i missed my hand , i remember putting up a few days before the  UNK  fell down .
when i talk to you today , these people are still in doing this , &quot; risk that life without or payment , and it &apos;s usually  UNK  or payment .
i get out of that hole , and they get home , but maybe they wouldn &apos;t be home , but maybe they &apos;re not going to be seven .
over the last 28 years , i document on the local culture in the country , and in 2009 i had an honor to be the privilege of getting to be the summit that make at the summit in vancouver and make the summit that make .
and some of the incredible people that i saw in there , i met some people who were free from a  UNK  campaign .
we &apos;re starting to talk about , and i &apos;m actually starting to know about slavery , because i knew that it was there , but it wasn &apos;t there .
after the talk , i was really awful lot of shame and really embarrassed about this so monstrous , and i had this one of my life , and i knew how many people wouldn &apos;t it ?
it started  UNK  , so a few weeks after i flew to fly a gate after gate and helped them to make a progressive program .
and from that journey of the money into the world .
it &apos;s odd that i &apos;ve been talking about these places .
some say i like to myself .
but for this time , i want to cover up cover .
a  UNK  , we know , we &apos;ve got over 27 million people in the world today .
twice as many people were removed from africa during the trade .
150 years ago , there was a  UNK   UNK   UNK  income per year .
that &apos;s equivalent to 50,000 u.s. today .
but today , many generations of family as much as as  UNK  as a gift .
it was amazing slavery . we make 13 billion dollars a year -- that &apos;s all over the world .
a lot of people are being cheated on very best avenue , which shows better , to see themselves , not only the kids who work to do their own work .
now slave trade that trade is now , where the value emerges , these values that we create value out .
slave is visible in the world , wherever it is , it is illegal .
in india , and nepal , i had a brick with a anxiety .
this bird &apos;s-eye view of the world looks like the  UNK  of his chest .
it was covered in close to the heat , for example , young women children , children were being sued for the veil , for the  UNK  , like  UNK  , bricks , and all the  UNK  , and all of these  UNK  trucks , and take these hundred meters of trucks there .
UNK   UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  , they &apos;re quiet down , again , and i was 16 hours every day .
there is no food , it &apos;s not a very serious problem of why it should be a very serious tragedy .
and the hot spot is that the camera is so hot that i can &apos;t hit the button .
20 minutes , i have to go back to the car , and to turn them down to the lower body temperatures , and when we sit there , i think it &apos;s okay to treat your camera , i &apos;d better be treated .
come back in , i just want to get you to the  UNK  , who quickly gets to hold dear , i quickly and said , &quot; you can do it right here . &quot;
he was very clear that emotion is very dangerous in danger like this , not to me , but with them .
i couldn &apos;t help them .
i didn &apos;t give them money .
i &apos;m not a citizen .
i could put them in their situation worse than their current situation .
i had to be based on the extremist organization so that they freed up to liberate from me .
for me , we had to wait to melt away .
in the himalayas , i see the kids who has been miles down the mountain in the street .
these are  UNK  times more  UNK  kids , bringing them  UNK  kids , they &apos;re using their heads up with their  UNK  sticks .
it &apos;s too heavy .
how can we make this figure out , what &apos;s going on ?
some people don &apos;t even know that they &apos;re turning into a career , they didn &apos;t work for 16 hours a day , because they tell their life .
they don &apos;t have anything to compare .
when this village became free , the  UNK  of their books .
these people don &apos;t have anything , they want to give up , who want to give up the  UNK  of the  UNK  , and people  UNK  the  UNK  of it , and they basically  UNK  the  UNK  of the business career . now they &apos;re still doing their work , but they can do it now .
we tend to think of trade as sexual slaves when i hear from &quot;  UNK  , &quot; and i &apos;m aware of this : it &apos;s very difficult to work for the industry to be safe in this particular industry .
in  UNK  , i have been escorted by the young women who were sexual slavery .
they were sticking down stairs into the stairs of the stairs .
this is actually not a church .
it &apos;s a restaurant .
but the restaurants , like  UNK  to know , to sleep in a place of prostitution .
every single room , where young men , women said , young men , women and girls , their age seven , every step of seven and their customers , even more and buy more food and buy more price .
it &apos;s slept in the same places , and it &apos;s got  UNK  by the lines of separate and blinds the curtain times .
so people are often  UNK  to make their miserable neighbors .
in the corner , i remember , i remember the feeling of the fear , and that moment i understood , and that was how hell goes in hell .
there &apos;s one word : the stairs that stairs that stairs .
no .
there &apos;s no windows that big window .
these people have no escape hatch , when we talk about a difficult topic , that needs a slave trade of trade , that was made of a slave trade center where we live .
tens of thousands of people were taken in agriculture , in  UNK  ,  UNK  , and the list of a long list .
recently , new york times article dated from 100,000 to 100,000 children were talking about 100,000 to  UNK  every year .
it &apos;s around us . we &apos;re not only seeing .
the textile industry is often thought about when you hear about workers .
i went to a village in india , where lots of domestic big families sold in the slave trade .
this is the family portrait .
the hands of dyed your hand  UNK  , and that &apos;s my hands of him .
they hid in the big  UNK  dye , and the silk solution to the  UNK  fluid , which was filled up with a dye .
my translation work alone .
they said , &quot; we don &apos;t have freedom , free .
but it &apos;s still hoping that one day can get away and say we &apos;re being collected some . &quot;
estimated that maybe it &apos;s over 4,000 million children at the largest  UNK  , they built the world .
first time i went there . i went through a skim scan .
i see it &apos;s like a family of fish in the family , some little better than two brothers ?
they &apos;re all right .
children are removed from the family , and the missing shelter , and the ones that are closed off these boat on these boat , they don &apos;t know .
this child is eight years old .
my  UNK  sister came to the boat , the  UNK  boat to get through their tiny  UNK  .
he was terrified .
the branches of the trees that are commonly used by fishing nets , nets , and kids who just got just laid down into the water .
a lot of them drown .
what he was remembered , i was being caught in them .
the people who aren &apos;t  UNK  , and she was treated because they went from  UNK  , they went down to the  UNK  .
i met these boys , at 5 every 5 a.m. , when they &apos;re pulling their mothers into the net from morning , but they &apos;re making one morning .
in the dark matter .
notice that these nets are actually heavy telescopes when they &apos;re close to them .
i &apos;d like to kofi annan .
kofi annan from a kofi annan .
i met him in the rescue aid agencies that are  UNK  from the slaves .
this is where i &apos;m staying up at the top of the water , where the mouth and i &apos;m great , and when you &apos;re talking to my family , and i talked to a kofi annan , and they were engaged in a living , and they keep a living on a secure future .
kofi annan &apos;s the ability to kofi annan &apos;s the ability to kofi annan .
what are you going to be if someone stands up and change your life ?
driving the road in ghana , but also in his colleagues from the extremist party , some of the people that you are vastly  UNK  by the way , we flew out against the window .
he told us we went to the  UNK  in a muddy field , in a woods .
at the end of the road , we urge you to hold a urge you to hold a day .
and then the footprint was incredibly boring and where this is , and this is the word goes . &quot;
the follow line , we followed the legs , and after about a hour , and after a hour of the birds , leaving behind the rains , and then i photographed the first visited our  UNK  .
after two hours of  UNK  , they began to surprisingly close down in front of the eyes , and we had between these parts of the football field , they &apos;re full of  UNK  workers .
a lot of women on the back in the air , and the water through the viral infection .
UNK  is used in the process .
but this miner &apos;s taken in the grave of my  UNK  region of ghana .
when they get out of their  UNK  , they  UNK  themselves .
i remember looking at the eye level of their eyes , so many people who have already been there for 72 hours .
but the next thing i had a hundred meters of their pocket , they had already been moved on to the ground , where i was going to get to the gold .
so look at the building sites that seem to be healthy , but when you look closer together , there are more fortunate enough to work .
they are all vulnerable .
in fact , many of these people will eventually become infected , it was like a viral infection , and from within the years .
this is  UNK  . when he &apos;s got his eyes , he &apos;s got the uncle working on the same site .
when the  UNK  , the  UNK  of its lineage of  UNK  , and the slaves who are  UNK  in this neighborhood .
when i met , you &apos;ve been 14 years in the area of the  UNK  , and you see here is an accident , where you &apos;re bored by the accident .
on top of all ,  UNK  , but it was still getting caught on day .
anyway , he still had a freedom to go to school with the help of local communities like slavery , and we are willing to free , and determination to the people &apos;s faces , to make these incredible people .
i &apos;d like to get out of light .
when i work in this field , i brought a lot of people with the help to translate the  UNK  of people that i wanted to take pictures and the circumstances that i wanted to capture and my stories , and when i was safe and took pictures .
they know their pictures are going to be seen by people out there , like you &apos;re out there .
i want to know that we &apos;re going to do them , and we &apos;ll do whatever they can do .
i really believe , if we consider other people like the kind of human beings , it &apos;s kind of like  UNK  crimes .
but the picture is not about yourself , and it &apos;s about humanity , and it &apos;s true , and i &apos;m all worthy of honor , and respect to honor , and respect it should stand in each other .
there &apos;s no day that i don &apos;t think about these amazing people who have a great honor to meet them .
i hope that images will awaken possibility , those people in the power , those people you , and the hope that fire , and it will be red dot , because there &apos;s no such thing as the dark matter , because there &apos;s dark under the dark .
thank you very much .
