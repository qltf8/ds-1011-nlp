hello . my name is kevin  UNK  . i was a youtube .
it &apos;s true .
so we &apos;re going to talk about why some videos are becoming increasingly important .
we all want to be a celebrity celebrity , celebrity , when i was a young man , i was very young .
but now , the web allows us to do something that we can do , and we want to be part of the world .
you know , anybody on the internet , on saturday sunday .
but there &apos;s more than 48 hours on youtube .
in many cases , it &apos;s very unlikely to be  UNK  and  UNK  , and they become a  UNK  .
how about this ?
three keys : the keys , there are three keys .
okay , let &apos;s see us .
so , mr.  UNK  : oh , my god .
oh , my god !
ooh !
oh , wow !
last year , there was a little bit of  UNK  , and he filmed him .
in 2010 , it &apos;s been seen by 2010 .
this graph shows the end of this graph .
but the bear had no intention .
he wanted to share a rainbow .
because it &apos;s exactly the same thing called  UNK  .
he had a lot of videos .
this video is actually upload last year .
so what &apos;s happened ?
jimmy  UNK  .
jimmy  UNK   UNK   UNK  the tweets of this tweet .
because there &apos;s a pioneer of jimmy  UNK  , which is the kind of interesting things that bring us into the audience .
rng : so today , today &apos;s friday , and saturday evening , everybody &apos;s watch on saturday . and watch on saturday sunday . so on saturday : if you &apos;re not going to work on saturday .
rebecca newberger goldstein : &quot; the annual video is one of the year .
it &apos;s attracted to two billion other people .
this chart shows the trends .
it &apos;s like a rainbow trout with the rainbow .
what was that day ?
oh , that day , that &apos;s a friday .
if you wonder , those peaks at the peak .
but what happened on that day ?
it &apos;s chosen to pick up a lot of tribal divisions .
and the secret of science is michael  UNK  , john  UNK   UNK   UNK  video .
the point is that a group of a bunch of videos , and we &apos;re going to share with a red video .
and the community , it &apos;s not only a joke , but it will be able to talk about it .
so now , there &apos;s a couple of thousand words on youtube .
even on monday , we have a different kind of trick .
unlike the media , entertainment media , it &apos;s a collective phenomenon , which is part of the 20th century -- it &apos;s a part of the 20th century .
this is just a  UNK  . it &apos;s a  UNK  .
that &apos;s just this .
it &apos;s been estimated to see 50 million times .
if you think it &apos;s incredible , you &apos;re even more difficult to imagine that this is an amazing version of this .
and even there &apos;s a little video .
the cat watching the other cat .
but this is the key idea of the most important geeks , the geeks become the network .
it &apos;s also  UNK  .
some of the nostalgia .
and then the route .
the whole red  UNK  that made a joke that it &apos;s just a joke .
now , we &apos;re not only involved in this .
who knows this ?
and who knows , &quot; rainbows spraying spraying spraying or  UNK  , &quot; or &quot; spraying ?
what are you going to write script ?
in this case , it &apos;s enough for two days to watch the world videos and unique videos .
my friend of mine is a good friend of mine , a good video of new york city , i had to admit that i had no interest .
so , i got a ticket , i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not going to ride a bike lane , but because you &apos;re riding on bike bike lane .
kevin  UNK  : the surprising way that humor is interesting to think about how interesting ideas and the way to see it &apos;s interesting .
and this way works for us .
so the problem is that we have a problem ...
what is the bear ?
oh ...
kevin : what does this mean ?
the pioneer of the vanguard of creativity , and the new medium , and the new medium of participation and the new medium of participation .
and as i did , as i &apos;m a little bit of a little bit of  UNK  on youtube .
your ideas don &apos;t need to be  UNK  .
we have autonomy in our culture . we have autonomy .
but it &apos;s not the old medium , which is not the old medium of the media , but they &apos;re not going to be the future of entertainment media .
thank you .
enough for 10 minutes , i &apos;m talking about three generations of women in three minutes , the power of the mother of the power of the mother of the ages of four ages of four years old , and she had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little girl in san francisco , and over the course of the last 30 years -- that little girl has been in san francisco , and i &apos;m going to tell you that little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
a story constantly .
it &apos;s like a puzzle .
allow me to tell you about that .
in retrospect , the first work is a man to work .
he &apos;s a full circle of life and his whole life .
imagine he was a communist communist communist he was facing a whole life .
it &apos;s a friend of ridicule .
he silence .
as history , he died .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never know about his life .
but our lives are richer than our lives .
my grandfather had his grandfather .
and my responsibilities is that he didn &apos;t bother me to be the responsibility of the history of my responsibility .
the next piece of puzzle came out of the morning .
my mother was 18 years old , and i had a series of two years old .
for her life , she &apos;s only fled australia , and the new life begins .
it &apos;s not going to happen to her .
so , four out of four years of fishing , trying to get out of fishing .
people know they &apos;re dangerous .
the threat is the threat of rape and death .
and as adults , i was with my mother .
if we were caught in my sister , my mother and my grandmother .
my first memory comes from a little boat -- and the waves of the waves , and the sea level of sea level .
i don &apos;t remember a couple of times the pirate ship , and it &apos;s got kicked off the coast of  UNK  .
but i remember walking along the coast of the coast , from the  UNK  coast of malaysia , and the first  UNK  of the  UNK  , the first man came from  UNK  to the  UNK  .
there is no more delicious apples .
after the refugee camp three months , we lived in the city .
the next piece of puzzle is about three generations of women .
and the settled on a suburban  UNK  .
unlike the rest of the suburbs , i forget the suburbs of the suburbs , let me forget .
the store was like the taste of the world .
and speaking of english , the same thing , people have the same thing .
the mother was working in rural villages , and then went to work on a week .
sometimes she got english learning english , she got it .
we are poor .
it saves money from the money . it &apos;s used to pay for the rest of the world , even without any new  UNK  .
in the sock  UNK  , and the hole in the sock  UNK  .
in school , the school of the knee , because it &apos;s six years old .
very few , but very few , very few of them , occasionally , and they say , &quot; go home ! &quot;
where go back home ?
something that was like my  UNK  .
it &apos;s a force that pulls out in silence : &quot; i &apos;m going to be able to transcend space . &quot;
my sister and my sister and i slept in my bed .
the mother was dragging ourselves around the house , but we were having a conversation with each other day , while we were listening in the room .
my mother has been troubling , and the boat is a little boat .
and my job is to be awake , when she had nightmares .
she went to a store , and she &apos;s going to play a computer .
the story of men who didn &apos;t make the transition , kind of boring problems , like two toddlers .
looking for money and funding .
the center was built .
i live in a parallel world .
on one hand , i &apos;m a typical student in asia .
on the other hand , on the other hand , and the sad conflict of violence and the drugs of apartheid .
but it &apos;s so many years .
when i was in my graduate school , i was selected as being a young child .
i &apos;m just going to jump from the other one to the other .
tan le bar√≥n to go to a refugee camp , and now , is a former mayor of speech , an activist , a former speech .
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know how to use it .
you don &apos;t talk about it .
it won &apos;t speak .
i &apos;d like to go back to the suburbs of the suburbs , and my grandmother &apos;s life , two daughters were talking about 20 years , and they were talking about the past two years , and we &apos;re talking about three days .
i tell my mother , i couldn &apos;t do .
she reminded me that when she came out of a boat , she &apos;s right now .
no choice .
&quot;  UNK  , she said , &quot; she &apos;s really true . &quot;
so i talked about unemployment and education and political rights and political issues .
the more i tell you , the more i invite the more people .
people around the people who are doing their own lives .
even if i finished my law , i realized i couldn &apos;t realize that i couldn &apos;t law .
here &apos;s another puzzle .
at the same time , i realized that the outsider could have been on the screen , but it &apos;s not just a little bit of news , but it &apos;s a little boat .
because as a receiver , it &apos;s easy to give up the horizon .
now i &apos;m going to stand in the zone of the world , and you start to worry about the world .
it &apos;s not allowed to allow you to zoom in .
there &apos;s energy , there &apos;s a curiosity .
follow my hunch .
and i got a group of tags that i can &apos;t challenge .
a year , we &apos;re a year .
every day , i ended up with a whole bunch of people .
every single night .
most of our ideas are crazy , and a few crazy breakthroughs .
i felt like i moved to america .
after traveling .
my intuition is again .
i got three months later , after three months .
and at the end of my grandmother .
she grew up in the age of local  UNK  .
a few centuries of centuries .
she died .
mothers are alone .
she was 17 who married a man who had suffered from  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
husbands don &apos;t have supporting his husband , he went to court himself , and she went to court .
it &apos;s impossible . &quot;
when she went out of 600 miles away , i was on 600 miles in sydney .
through the windows and i saw her .
i know she was a goodbye .
my mother had a couple of minutes later .
a few days later , we went to sit , and she sat there .
and we tell her story , she talks about her .
midnight , we tell him , we have to tell him .
my mother felt that my grandmother &apos;s hand .
and she said , &quot; why is the brewing of your grandmother ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve always been saying , &quot; he &apos;s now .
&quot; you never let go . &quot;
and if we have the incentive to drive it .
we think about ourselves and our lives , we can now shape our lives , and we have to have to be able to fit into our lives .
it &apos;s easy to fail .
now , i want to myself .
who is there ?
but i was scared of privilege and rights .
and they give their oars to reinforce each other , every possible , without any kind of  UNK  , without any kind of  UNK  , without any doubt ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i can just look at it , and i look at them .
tan ,  UNK  , today &apos;s fourth and the fourth highest  UNK  , fourth and  UNK  .
i &apos;d like to share with you a little bit today .
or , is this picture ?
because of course , this is obviously , but you &apos;re not photographing it .
and yet , my first interest started with my first digital cameras , i was 15 years old .
it was a little while ago , but i had a little bit like a little while ago , because it was already quite good .
and when you take a picture of the shutter lag of the whole process .
so , in my view , the right place .
i think anyone can do this .
so i wanted to do something special about something special about the whole process of the entire process .
so this is a picture of the road : roads .
so mundane differences .
nonetheless , it still remains a  UNK  .
or it &apos;s like this image of its color , but it has a sense of its purpose .
i mean , i &apos;m talking about realism .
because it &apos;s not really what you &apos;re really trying to grab me , but it seemed to be a way that it looks like .
these are pictures that you need to figure out what they &apos;re going to be able to do .
so more inspiration is an inspiration from a moment , rather than an authentic moment .
but what &apos;s going to make these pictures ?
is it about color ?
or is it about light ?
what is it ?
sometimes it creates different visions of different visions .
but ultimately , if we want to be able to understand how this is a two-dimensional world in terms of thinking about how it is reflected in the world .
it &apos;s not really about what it &apos;s really about what we look like .
so i think it &apos;s pretty straightforward .
i think of it as a puzzle in the real world , and you can actually create a different reality .
let me give you an example .
there are three of these three things that exist in real world , and we can find them in real world .
but if you combine these objects , you can create some kind of visual objects , it &apos;s still three-dimensional objects .
but we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re lied to our own brains , because it &apos;s the brain wouldn &apos;t accept that exist .
it &apos;s a picture .
it &apos;s just a different picture .
so what makes a look like a picture of things that look like , we don &apos;t even want to think about everyday life .
but when we look at this picture , we &apos;re going to think about it .
i want to say three simple principles that we want to follow simple rules .
you see , these images are not special .
but they get together , they create this image .
so the first principles of all the principles are being present .
secondly , there &apos;s also a picture of light .
these are two pictures of both these two pictures that were taken by the same altitude .
the third principle is to make a difference between those principles , make a difference .
it makes no reference to how to make this picture .
by specifying the edges of the edges of the colors , the brightness and also to add the depth of the depth of the depth of the distance between us and the colors of the boundary between us , even if it looks like a single picture , even if it looks like a hundred meters , even if it &apos;s accessible across the border .
here &apos;s another example .
some people may think this is just a part of the process .
but this picture is actually taken by a different place .
i personally think it &apos;s a place where you &apos;re going to find a way that you don &apos;t have to compromise your mind .
but there &apos;s a lot of planning .
in winter , when i came out of the last year , i know , i was planning to go to the site , and this is a picture of a puzzle .
like this fish from a  UNK  .
the coast of the coast .
underwater .
and i had a house on the island of the house on the island of red .
in order to achieve the most important effect of what i think is planning .
it &apos;s always about the idea of thinking .
and that &apos;s a different picture .
and here &apos;s a picture of planning .
if you can get a picture , it &apos;s pretty cool .
so all of the tools that allow us to limit our limitations .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about the science of education .
i think the most important thing is that we don &apos;t listen to patients .
one of the things we did at the university of the chief officer .
it &apos;s not a very scientific way -- or she asked her , or she asked her relatives , &quot; well , my relatives ?
what do we need to help us ? &quot;
and i want to think that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to fail to fail to do , and that &apos;s one of the reasons why we don &apos;t listen .
this is my weight is a very simple  UNK  .
here &apos;s a switch .
i weigh every morning .
ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
i &apos;m going to push it back to  UNK  .
in fact , it &apos;s very simple , and i sent it to google .
and at the same time i was able to get a question , and then i got a question , when i was looking at heart disease , but when you look at a heart attack , you &apos;re looking at a heart attack .
but there &apos;s a little bit .
some of you may know that i have on twitter lists .
so i weigh every morning , i weigh my life before i got my car , and i said , &quot; i want you to talk to you today , or jenn . &quot;
but it &apos;s actually a good colleague , because it &apos;s the best way to help the patient -- you can actually help prevent obesity .
but on the other hand , it can bring people to participate in this game .
the next week , the one week later .
it will be a little bit like a little smartphone or other devices .
and then people went out to measure their blood pressure , and then they gave them to share a $ 100 dollars .
and that &apos;s the point of view , when they collect data , they &apos;re able to control their own health care , but we &apos;re facing the health care costs of health care costs .
we need to make it easy to drive a patient .
you can do that with this technology , and then you can apply the ordinary citizens .
and i &apos;m going to show you a clip from a project .
we have navigation in your car .
even in the mobile phone .
we know that  UNK  is in the city .
and you know the gas stations .
and of course , there &apos;s fast food restaurants .
but recently , what can save lives ?
we didn &apos;t know that nobody knows .
nobody knows that nobody knows that life can be saved lives .
we belong to the whole task of the dutch people .
we &apos;ve built a website , and if you see people , you see a person who &apos;s lives on the internet , if you see it &apos;s open up to the location of 24 hours .
in the netherlands has been  UNK  .
the next step is to develop .
we developed an app for an ipad .
a  UNK  app for  UNK  .
if you look at the iphone , you can see a couple of weeks in the iphone , you can save lives .
i &apos;d like to talk today about is not just the name of the product .
we &apos;re going to push this project around the world .
and here we have calls for our colleagues around the world to help us to get together all around the world .
so when you go out and you see someone who &apos;s like you &apos;re looking at it , you &apos;re just finding your loved ones .
and here &apos;s also what we call to call the company , and we can actually test them .
for example , for instance , or  UNK  , or if you look at the position of  UNK  .
so , in this project , let &apos;s help us not only make us healthier .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to talk about some unexpected discoveries .
now i work at the time .
and i started looking at the beginning of my company , and we &apos;re looking at it .
it &apos;s been done .
this little video shows what we &apos;re doing .
ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
the video needs to be video .
maybe we can skip -- i &apos;ll skip the rest of the video -- maybe we &apos;ll see ...
don &apos;t go .
this is not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
no , i don &apos;t have time ?
okay , thank you very much .
a few years ago , i started a few years ago , and some of the people who are living in the environment , and they should hate the environment .
this project is called &quot; code for america , &quot; the u.s. peace corps .
and we spend a few of them , and they make them work for government .
they don &apos;t send the city , but they send the city center .
well , there &apos;s a very good app for the city .
but what they really want to show is the possibility of creating possibilities .
this is al .
al  UNK  : a  UNK  fire hydrants .
it looks like it seems to be waiting for a date , but it &apos;s a real time that it would be brought up to the snow dragon tattoo , because when it gets up to the snow dragon until four feet , because when the snow has gone down to the snow dragon .
how does it work with a special way to help ?
last year we &apos;ve got a code in the united states .
they were in february when they were in february of february , and last year .
they noticed that the city dug up to the fire hydrants every city .
and the team of the people noticed that there was something called the  UNK   UNK  : the citizens of the citizens of the city &apos;s going to get rid of the fire hydrant .
so he did a good programmer , he did a programmer , he wrote an app .
this is a program where you could make a cute little program .
and then you agree with snow dragon .
if you do that , you can do this ; you can named him .
but if you don &apos;t dig it up , you can steal it from someone else .
so it has a little bit of entertainment .
this is a relatively small program .
it might be a program that year , the tiniest  UNK  program .
but it has done anything with other government .
it &apos;s like a virus .
a person in honolulu number of people in honolulu , and we saw this program , and then you realize that it would have taken out of the snow .
the tsunami of the tsunami , but it &apos;s important to steal a battery .
so he gave them active citizens .
and then decided to take a place in seattle on the streets of seattle .
it &apos;s going to get people out to get the snow on the snow .
we now know that cities are already using the plans .
it &apos;s very smoothly organically . it &apos;s organic .
if you look at the government of the government , you know , it &apos;s not a result .
it &apos;s a software that takes a few years .
last year we had a team of last year , two months and a half months ago .
it can help parents decide which is the best school for children .
and then we were told that , if we were going to be normal , at least two years , at least two years , it would cost about two million dollars .
and this is just a small number .
california has spent a billion dollars on a billion dollars of a project , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there &apos;s a program that has a similar project .
so a couple of days , just like a few days , like a program , for a government .
it &apos;s a lot more productive , but it &apos;s not even more efficient .
it &apos;s not even more like technology than the internet itself .
that means that you &apos;re going to be productive .
and this is very important .
but this is more important to represent the new generation of people , the new generation of government officials are looking at the problem of government .
and this is a good message , because the truth is , because the digital information is very good , very good , very good at work .
now , there &apos;s a very large group that we can build a much more productive tools .
it &apos;s not only the code of the united states , but there are hundreds of thousands of people every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up .
and they were very disappointed , but they didn &apos;t complain , and they were complaining about it .
these people know that we &apos;ve lost something .
and that &apos;s when you peel the peel away from the skin , we feel like our politics , for example , how we feel the government at the center of the government , and we can do it with the government .
now there are a lot of people in the government .
if you &apos;re one of them , i hope you &apos;ll think about it , because i think there &apos;s a lot of things .
there &apos;s no political change , but the government is changing .
and because the energy of the government , the most fundamental way we think about how it affects our people .
and when i started this project , i don &apos;t know how much government .
it &apos;s like a lot of people thought that there were only people in elections .
two years later , i came up with a government .
this is the service and the telephone services .
if you &apos;re in the city , you &apos;re going to be connected to the city .
and if you have a chance to work at the center of the work at home , and we do this project , and in fact , the fact that they need a lot of different people , and you know , they &apos;re very different from a government called  UNK  .
scott got a telephone call .
he &apos;s going to be typed in the official .
there was no control for him .
and finally , he said , &quot; well , you can open your door and open your door , and then you open the door , and if you leave it , you go to the door , you leave it ? &quot;
and that &apos;s scott .
but this is not the end of the story .
there is no  UNK  .
it has a program , a website called  UNK  and programmers .
we didn &apos;t have this program .
it &apos;s a bunch of new urban structures that are very smart people .
and one day , this is a real report -- this is a message : &quot; well , there &apos;s a saying , &quot; well , you know if it &apos;s not dead .
how can i make it ? &quot;
it &apos;s a different way to deal with different kinds of problems .
scott &apos;s communicated .
but there is a connectivity between citizens of connectivity .
it &apos;s a neighbor .
we got a report that we got a report on the back of the house , and i found this house .
i mean , that &apos;s true .
you &apos;re going to go home .
&quot;  UNK  . &quot;
it &apos;s just simple .
so this is a great digital world .
and this is also a great example of crowdsourcing to a game .
but this is also an example of a government to do .
and i mean , i &apos;m not talking about technology .
i just want to mention a platform to help each other .
one of the other citizens of civil government , and the government plays .
it &apos;s got two together .
it can be used by governments to help governments , but it needs a lot of people in the government .
and when the other neighbors , we also associate with a social connection .
we call the center for a lot of money .
one of the things that we need to think about is different from the government .
many people understand this , but they still don &apos;t think it &apos;s still the government .
we &apos;re going to enter the mouth system .
so far , we chose to select our political leaders -- and there &apos;s a huge amount of energy , and we have a lot of support , and then we do something , and then we do something , and what &apos;s going on ?
and that &apos;s because it &apos;s the ocean of the ocean , the top of the ocean .
this is what we &apos;re called  UNK  .
we use this word &quot; talk about it .
but this is the kind of  UNK  that we have to maintain our desire to maintain our desire to maintain our desire , and we are losing ourselves .
people seem very sexy .
and if we want this to serve a service provider , we have to make sexy .
because the government is working there .
we have to engage the government system .
and this is the occupy movement .
have you ever seen these people ?
they were a bunch of citizens , they wrote a very detailed report , and a very detailed report to the united states of the united states .
it &apos;s not participation , but it &apos;s involved .
now , for us , we &apos;ve given up the government , and we asked ourselves to ask ourselves , how we want to leave ourselves .
you have to realize that they need to confront challenges .
well , we don &apos;t have any good action , before we can do , we really want to reach the goal ?
we can &apos;t have to be able to make it efficient .
well , the news is that the news is that it &apos;s doable in nature , and we can rebuild our government .
now , the generation of networks are growing up , and they know that they &apos;re not hard to do .
our average age 28 of the average age 28 , so i was very old , very , very old , very old generation .
this generation grew up in their own habits .
they don &apos;t need to go through the generation of freedom of speech , and we all have the fight against them .
they can have any time to express their time to express their opinions .
so when they were faced with the government , they didn &apos;t care about it .
they use their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands , and they can make them better programs .
and that allows us to use our own hands .
it could be dug up a fire hydrant , and i &apos;m going to put a bunch of crap .
and of course , a lot of people began to fire hydrant .
but it &apos;s like a small number that can remind us that it &apos;s not just as consumers , but we also pay for government taxes .
we &apos;re not just as citizens .
before the government does improve our government , we must have responsibilities as citizens .
so i &apos;m here to leave you with a problem : when we &apos;re dealing with a bunch of big problems , we need to do need a bunch of people together , we have a bunch of people , and we &apos;re just a bunch of people , and we &apos;re a bunch of people who are still working together ?
thank you .
and since i was explaining how people are going to explain how this wonderful technologies are going to come up with me , and i &apos;m going to try to look at what &apos;s going on , and i &apos;m trying to understand what &apos;s going on to happen .
let me start with a slide that &apos;s very boring slide .
and then you can start .
this is just a random sample of my file .
i want you to look at the detail of it , but it &apos;s not detail .
this is what we &apos;re doing is about the power of  UNK  and the power of the slides .
the interesting slide is that the slide is that we &apos;re familiar with a slide on a logarithmic graph .
and here &apos;s the performance of the performance of the performance .
on a logarithmic graph . this is a technology .
it &apos;s a little freaky .
that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to say .
the lights on the lights .
please give me the highlight of the piece of paper .
why are we going to use a curve ?
well , the answer is , if i painted a normal curve , and i said , this is a typical year of time , and this is a kind of technology , which looks kind of a little bit like this .
it &apos;s kind of like this .
and there is no information .
now , if i do , for example , there &apos;s another technology , like a  UNK  curve , and it looks like a  UNK  curve .
but if you look like this .
if you look at transportation costs , as fast as fast forward , and then i &apos;ll give you a 30 seconds .
but it didn &apos;t go faster .
in the history of technology has never been doubling every few years , every couple of years .
now i want to ask you , if you look at the curve , you &apos;re never going forever .
things don &apos;t change the way .
two things happen .
it &apos;s either going to be a typical situation .
that &apos;s all possible .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i &apos;m an optimist .
and if that means that we &apos;re at the moment .
we seem to turn this line up in the past , from the past .
and all i ask myself , and i ask myself , &quot; which is the future ?
it &apos;s a new age of information ?
and because it seemed to be very , very confused when we &apos;re at the time .
i grew up in the future , as i grew up in 2000 , and in 2000 , and what will happen in 2000 .
now , this conference is talking about the future in the future , and you find that in the future . &quot;
that &apos;s how we can achieve .
in other words , in other words , in the future .
and the reason i think we &apos;re feeling that we &apos;re feeling .
it &apos;s happening .
we know to think about the future , the future of all , because everything is going to be in the future , because there &apos;s no meaning in the future .
so i &apos;m going to talk about how we &apos;re going to experience what we &apos;re going to be .
and for the purpose of this , i &apos;ve got to talk about technology and computer technology .
because i decided to look at the only way to look at the timeline .
and the timeline is the timeline of the timeline on earth is a time of life on earth .
and i think it &apos;s a reasonable factor , if you look at each time .
so if you look back a little bit of a big old planet , and it &apos;s big , big , big old chemicals .
and if you look at the chemistry , we start to understand how they start to understand how they form .
and i think there &apos;s some kind of understanding of life , but i want to start talking about life , and that &apos;s the story of the chemical composition of that , that &apos;s a different kind of chemistry .
there are some chemicals in the droplet , and they can lead to the chemical energy from the outside world .
it &apos;s like this droplet , we started to separate .
the most primitive droplet form of these cells , in some way , these little droplet cells .
but now , the droplet , it &apos;s not true , because we &apos;re living in a chemical soup , because each of the chemical soup is a random sample .
every time , it &apos;s not a distribution of chemistry .
so it &apos;s a different droplet .
and in fact , it &apos;s a different way to look at each other , they &apos;re able to grow more .
so they have to do better .
it &apos;s kind of a little bit like a chemical form of chemistry , but when it gets interesting to information , it &apos;s an interesting droplet .
somehow we can &apos;t understand how we can &apos;t understand it .
they learn to learn how to make a special place called  UNK  , and it &apos;s called  UNK  .
that means , they came up with this kind of evolutionary genetic information , and they can write the genetic information , so that they can replicate it .
and the surprising way that it seemed to be stable by 25 million years ago .
in fact , we &apos;re exactly the same genetic code , is exactly the same way .
in fact , any organism is exactly the same letters .
in fact , what i did was to do is to do with the things that we can use this code .
i &apos;ve got 100 meters of  UNK  , i found myself in the airport security .
but there &apos;s a code that i got there , and i &apos;m holding the letters of the code , and we have a  UNK  , and then i put it on a card , and then i &apos;ll zoom on a card .
so if somebody needs millions of people , i have enough money to give me a card , everyone around the world .
and if i &apos;m a person , i would put it in the room and put it into the room .
so what &apos;s next ?
and the  UNK  is an interesting thing .
it causes cells that make cells -- they make them happy .
but there &apos;s also a very interesting thing to do is that , and that &apos;s where the cells are beginning to exchange information .
i don &apos;t know if you know whether this bacterial bacterial oxygen , you can actually swap out .
that &apos;s why , for example , this is  UNK  .
there are some bacterial spores , and you know how to create a  UNK  , and then it &apos;s also a whole bunch of bacterial immunity around , and then we can carry a lot of bacterial communication , because bacterial immunity around them .
so , these groups communicate , in a sense , they &apos;re in a sense of the community ; they &apos;re on the boat .
and so they survive together , or that means that if a community , that means that if you can copy all of the individual groups .
and so , when it comes to those between groups , the groups , the fact that they concentrate , they decided to go to a whole bunch of different groups .
in the next phase of an interesting phase of life .
in this time , there are many groups of cells , many different groups of cells , which is a organism to cooperate .
in fact , this is how many cells are .
we have a lot of cells , they don &apos;t survive .
the skin doesn &apos;t work without the skin cells , without muscle cells , so on .
so these groups are starting to have evolved just a single cell , not just as a single cell .
and that &apos;s what happens in these groups .
so , these cells start to extract information .
they &apos;re starting to build a very specific group of people in the community .
these are nerves .
so the neuron is built up the information system .
in fact , in fact , the communities that are beginning to learn .
and that &apos;s the brain of the nervous system .
and that gives them to evolve .
because it &apos;s true of an individual organisms that can learn from individual organisms , and the whole organism is not an organism to evolve .
so a organism , for example , can &apos;t eat fruit , because it &apos;s disgusting to eat fruit .
and this can happen in a single organism , and then in this particular organism , and it was built this kind of an organism , and it takes a million years ago .
so the nervous system , and this particular case , the fact that it has accelerated evolution .
because evolution can actually happen in the individual .
it &apos;s happening in time .
but what &apos;s happening is that every individual , of course , is the secret .
so , for example , we know the most sophisticated version of human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention .
and i have a complicated idea , i thought , &quot; well .
and i &apos;m sitting there , and i &apos;m trying to create a kind of mind that &apos;s kind of like chaos .
but what we &apos;re trying to turn into the sound of the sounds of a complicated brain , and you &apos;re complicated .
so this is what we &apos;re going to push individual organisms .
so , actually , we &apos;ve actually been completed , we &apos;re beginning to start .
so we are undergoing a  UNK  organism , the same thing is that we &apos;re going to take the same information processing .
so , for example , this is a very small step .
so , on the phone , so on , and so forth , we &apos;re building a special mechanism for processing , and so we &apos;re building a mechanism .
all of these are the connections that we &apos;ve got together faster than before .
so evolution can now be subtle changes in time .
you &apos;ve looked at that little evolution of this little example of this little  UNK  program .
so we now accelerate our time .
and i &apos;ll tell you the first step of billions of years .
the next step , like the neuroscience of the brain .
and then again , it &apos;s going to be less than a million years .
the next tank , as if you do anything .
and this process is , and i guess , and i guess what we should be able to do is that , when it &apos;s the right thing .
the more change is , the faster the faster .
i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here .
we see that process back to the process .
now i &apos;m working on my computer , and i know that computers are used to be able to do not exist .
now , what i &apos;m doing is complex , maybe not possible to design objects .
i don &apos;t know that the machine is the transistors .
billions of billions of transistors .
in fact , what i &apos;ve done is that machine , what designers think we &apos;re doing is a certain kind of machine , and we &apos;re able to take a machine , and we can do it faster than we could do .
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s a way we don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s an interesting thing that i &apos;ve been using evolution in itself .
and what we &apos;re doing is that in an evolutionary process , and this is an arc of time .
for example , most extreme conditions , we actually can actually get through random sequence from random sequence .
the computer said , &quot; please give you a random sequence .
now , if you run all these randomly run by random instructions , all of the things that i want . &quot;
so , i &apos;m going to define what i am .
and i suppose that i have to give you some examples , i &apos;ve experimented with simple examples .
and find the best way to program .
of course , the instructions are not going to be able to sequence them .
but there &apos;s a great luck , and it &apos;s probably good luck .
and i said , &quot; please , give you 10 percent of the best .
that &apos;s the rest of that .
now , the best we have to copy these .
it &apos;s similar to copying process to copy them .
both of these two things that they &apos;re forced to raise their children .
so i got a new generation of a new generation .
and say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
again .
maybe some of these mutations .
let &apos;s try it again .
this generation needs to program every few milliseconds .
so i was able to do a few minutes in a few minutes , or in a few minutes , or a couple of years ago .
when i finished , i got absolutely perfect .
in fact , these are more efficient than anything .
now , if i read this , i don &apos;t tell them how to work .
i &apos;ve tried to read and explain how they work .
they &apos;re very strange .
but they can do it .
in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident that i &apos;ve got to do this , because they &apos;re able to program .
in fact , their life is their jobs .
i was once a time and i was sitting there , and he pulled it together , and he said , &quot; look at this .
it &apos;s a lot of ben , you know , there &apos;s a lot of security , you know , if you &apos;re safe ? &quot;
in fact , we know that the process is that complexity doesn &apos;t work .
so we &apos;re starting with computers to do with computers .
it allows us to make more complex than normal engineering .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand it .
in a sense , we &apos;re ahead of us .
we &apos;re now moving faster , and we can create this faster .
so it &apos;s feedback .
it &apos;s getting faster , and that &apos;s why i feel like this .
because of all these technologies give back to the feedback .
we &apos;re taking off .
so we &apos;re at some point at some time , this organism is just like a cell in the body .
we &apos;re like an amoeba , which is what we &apos;re creating is something that &apos;s like .
we &apos;re turning on the turning point .
but i think there must be something with .
i think it &apos;s a very strange definition of evolution , we think of evolution .
i think it &apos;s part of all of us , no matter what &apos;s next step .
it &apos;s nearly since there , i was still picked up , and i &apos;d like to end .
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
most of the time , i was in prison in prison death row .
most of the time i work in low-income communities in the communities of despair , and hopelessness , and it &apos;s going to do it .
and today , i &apos;ve seen a little bit of a little bit of a short period of time .
in this short time , i noticed in my time .
you can see what &apos;s happening here .
sometimes it happens when the ted stage on the ted stage .
i &apos;m talking about this because i think it &apos;s important .
we &apos;ve already heard some wonderful talk .
we &apos;ve already experienced a teacher , you have a teacher , and if you have a teacher , you have a teacher , you &apos;re teaching a teacher .
as a doctor , you can help you , if you &apos;re a doctor , you can help your doctor .
so i want to talk about importance .
i don &apos;t learn from other lawyers or other projects .
i actually learned from my grandmother .
my family was a black man who was a black family .
she was tough , rugged enough .
there is a struggle with her .
but there was a lot of money .
her parents were really true .
in the 19th century , she was in the &apos; 40s .
my grandmother was born in the late &apos; 80s , and the parents decided to look at the world .
my grandmother was very difficult , but she was loving kindness .
when i was a boy , i met her every time .
and she had to go , and i &apos;ll let her go .
and after hour , when i say goodbye to her , and she asked me , &quot; could i feel ? &quot;
and if i say , &quot; she feels like , she said , &quot; she feels like , &quot; she feels it feels like , &quot; she feels it feels like me .
and that &apos;s the ability to allow you to think about this .
the only challenge is that she had 10 men .
my mom was 10 .
i often go to my grandmother and harder to pay attention to my grandmother .
i was always ubiquitous .
i remember , when i woke up in the morning , i woke up in the morning .
my grandmother sitting on the other side of my room .
and i started playing games .
i looked at me , she went back , but she was very serious .
and about 20 minutes later , she stood up in the room and she said to me , &quot; and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about it . &quot;
it &apos;s just like yesterday .
i &apos;ll never be able to go .
and she said , &quot; i want you to say , &quot; don &apos;t want you to say , &quot; no . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , my grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; no , she said , &quot; i don &apos;t make sure . &quot;
and we sat down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to see me . &quot;
and she said , &quot; you &apos;re a kid . &quot;
she said , &quot; i &apos;m sure you can do anything . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget .
and she said , &quot; i want you to make sure that i promise you . &quot;
i said , &quot; my grandmother &apos;s grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , i want you to make sure you love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; mom , you &apos;re my mom , and i &apos;ll never be able to make sure she &apos;ll never be a place . &quot;
i love my mom , my grandmother said , &quot; well , i &apos;ll call my grandmother . &quot;
and the second thing she said , &quot; yes , you will always be hard to go , even if you &apos;re going to go . &quot;
i thought , &quot; well , i had my grandmother . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; i &apos;m going to make sure you drink . &quot;
i was nine years old , i said , &quot; i promised my grandmother . &quot;
i grew up in the south of the northeast of my older brother .
when i went back to my brother and i went back to my brother -- i don &apos;t know how about how i put him on my little tour .
he &apos;s crazy .
he drank a drink beer , and she handed me a drink , and i handed them .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t do it . &quot; i don &apos;t drink . &quot;
my older brother : &quot; well , we tend to come up with us .
i had a little bit drunk , and i drink . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want you to drink . &quot;
my brother .
ask , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
and then he looked at me , and i asked him , &quot; oh , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to do anything . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; i had my grandmother , and he said , &quot; he &apos;s very special . &quot;
i am sad .
now i want to be honest .
it may not be here .
because this talk is what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;ve got to admit that this year i &apos;ve never had drunk before .
this is not a moral imperative that i have to demonstrate the moral truth .
and when we decided that we were able to get the world that we could never accept .
we can make them feel the world .
and when i think about my grandmother , i think she &apos;s very special .
my grandfather was banned .
and i was just dying with a disease .
these principles are the principles i believe that we should carry .
i want to introduce you to a criminal justice system .
for 40 years , the country has changed a lot .
in 1972 , eddy in 1972 .
today , there &apos;s  UNK  .
today , the proportion of americans in the world today .
we have seven million people in  UNK  and  UNK  .
in my opinion , in my opinion , we changed our world .
in the poor communities of color in the communities of color in the community of desperation .
a third of the black men between 30 and 30 and the prison is a prison in prison or 30 or 40 .
in the country in cities in the country -- in los angeles -- 50 percent of the young people in los angeles -- a color of young people in jail .
our system is not only change the system , but it &apos;s about race around race .
this country is the rich justice system , if you guilty of the rich country is not guilty of innocent people .
wealth is not the result of wealth itself .
and yet , we &apos;ve been doing it .
the fear of anger and political and our wrists .
UNK  .
i &apos;m interested in this .
we can see some interesting things that are really interesting .
i &apos;m in the state of the chain , and if you were sentenced to life .
now , the black men are lost forever .
we look forward to 10 years ago , and political rights violations by the rights act .
but nobody &apos;s talking about half .
and i represent the kids .
there &apos;s a lot of great young .
the only country is the only place in the united states in the world .
and the whole life of imprisonment , and the whole life of imprisonment .
now we &apos;re actually helping those people .
it &apos;s a world .
i was a victim of the court .
the death penalty was very poignant .
we &apos;ve got to understand the fundamental question of whether it &apos;s the &quot;  UNK  .
it &apos;s a very logical question .
but on the other hand , we are ourselves .
the other question is , instead of &quot;  UNK  , &quot; we don &apos;t deserve to kill them .
i mean , this is very powerful .
the death penalty supporters in america .
every death penalty was sentenced to a death sentence , and it turned out to be proven guilty .
and this is one of the people of the  UNK  .
i have to say , very powerful .
it &apos;s an airplane , if you know it &apos;s an airplane in an airplane , we wouldn &apos;t fly an airplane .
but there &apos;s a problem that we can ignore them .
because it &apos;s not our own problems .
it &apos;s not our own trouble .
it &apos;s not ourselves .
i talked a lot about a lot .
and ethnicity , we also have  UNK  .
this is a very poignant reminder of the history of the history of slavery .
and they &apos;re talking about terrorism , when the second world war , the age of war ii .
we don &apos;t really understand history .
but for a black country , that &apos;s a black age .
there are a lot of people who were terrified to death .
people will worry about the bomb attacks .
and that time , they changed their lives .
now , at that time , and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; mr.  UNK  , mr.  UNK  , sir richard buchanan nicely tells you what the first time of 9 / 11 . &quot;
and they said , &quot; we &apos;re growing up . &quot;
and terrorism , of course , it became the end of terrorism , and it became the gulf of mexico and apartheid .
and yet , we don &apos;t like that .
we don &apos;t like to talk about history .
and that &apos;s why we can &apos;t understand what we do .
we &apos;re constantly trying to do that .
it &apos;s constantly making nervous .
we can &apos;t think about race because we don &apos;t want to look at a set of truth .
in south africa , we don &apos;t know that unless we &apos;re facing the midst of apartheid .
in rwanda , even though , even when people have faced in the united states , we don &apos;t want to do that .
i &apos;ve been talking about germany .
and it turns out that there &apos;s a wonderful scholar and saying , &quot; you know , you know , you &apos;re going to hear this . &quot;
she said , &quot; we don &apos;t have germany .
and of course , we &apos;ll never have germany . &quot;
ladies and gentlemen , we said , &quot; because we have history , we might decide that we might have decided to go .
and the execution of the execution of a death penalty supporters on death .
and i thought about this problem .
if i look at the germans , i look at the germans ?
i couldn &apos;t .
it &apos;s unreasonable .
but in this country , we were in the southern state of the south , because when white people were sentenced to a white death rate of the death rate is not only black , because when you were sentenced to a death rate -- because when you &apos;re sentenced to death rate -- the death rate of the death penalty supporters die of death .
but still , we don &apos;t passive inaction .
i believe that this means that we have a crisis .
so when we &apos;re good for the thorny fence , we &apos;re still on something positive , we still care about it .
we love innovation .
we love technology , we create love .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , the reality is that all the time of the misery of human rights , the human rights of the human rights .
for me , for those two things .
because ultimately , what we want to talk about how we want to deal with a lot more complex , more complex social complexity .
for me , for the time to think about the poor and the poor people who don &apos;t have the opportunity to have the opportunity .
but they think they &apos;re in a sense , in a sense of our lives .
you know , we have to believe that we have to see things .
we have to have a smart society .
innovation is not only , but it &apos;s not only in our brains .
they &apos;re from our brains and wisdom and our minds .
and this one thing that i believe is that not only those things that drive us into the dark side of the dark side .
marduk takes a great leader , this is a great leader of this problem .
he said , &quot; when we &apos;re dealing with the force of eastern europe , we want to resolve a lot of force , but we want to be the most important part of the heart of despair . &quot;
and the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the ted community .
it &apos;s not perfect enough to focus on the design of human nature and technology and human nature , and as long as we can focus on poverty and injustice .
and i want to remind you that this is rather challenging than the ones that are not much more challenging .
it affects you .
when i was an attorney , i was lucky enough to meet my wife .
and she goes on the montgomery ward &apos;s ward , and she &apos;s two best friends in her life , who was a woman who was a great honor of the  UNK  , who was a woman named  UNK  , who was a woman named martin  UNK   UNK  .
ladies and gentlemen , the question .
sometimes i would call my wife , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going back .
are you going to hear ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; well , my wife . &quot;
and she said , &quot; what are you here ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; i want to hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to listen .
these are very excited and very exciting .
and i was there a couple of hours later , and she asked me , &quot; she asked me , &quot; and she said , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about equality .
i &apos;m going to talk about you . &quot;
and i started  UNK  .
and i said , &quot; we don &apos;t want to injustice .
we wanted to help the  UNK  conviction .
we wanted to do criminal laws and prejudice against discrimination .
the children were sentenced to life without the end of life .
we wanted to make a difference .
we want to reduce the population .
we also want to keep from overeating . &quot;
i did an end with  UNK  ,  UNK  , when i was at the end , i said , &quot; look at me . &quot;
she said , &quot; you &apos;re going to get tired , you get tired . &quot;
and then , when she came up , she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s why you are brave . &quot;
i &apos;m sure that this ted community needs .
we need to find these challenges to face these problems .
because ultimately , we ultimately depends on human nature depends on human nature .
in my work .
i learned a very simple principle .
and i began to understand that every single person , we don &apos;t believe that we &apos;re going to be the worst .
i believe that every single person on this planet .
if he lied to a lie , he doesn &apos;t tell him that he &apos;s a liar .
if he had no idea that he belongs to something that he doesn &apos;t mean .
you don &apos;t even know about killer arguments . you don &apos;t know .
because i believe that human dignity has to respect the dignity of human dignity .
and i also believe that in the rich countries in the world , of course , not even a lot of wealthier .
i don &apos;t believe this .
and i think , there &apos;s a lot of the opposite sides .
and finally , i believe , although it &apos;s very beautiful , it &apos;s very beautiful , it &apos;s very exciting to think about the intersection of technology , it &apos;s not going to be  UNK  .
and finally , people think about this , we &apos;re not talking about the rich man , but what we do with the people who are treated with us .
because this is what we &apos;re really starting to really start to look like , what we have to understand .
i &apos;m going to end with a story .
sometimes i work too .
so , like everyone was like everybody .
sometimes these ideas are too long , and it &apos;s really severe .
i was sentenced to these children , and they were sentenced to jail .
i went to see , i &apos;m going to see the piarco adults are being treated as adults .
and i thought , what &apos;s going on ?
a judge , how can we figure out a different person ?
and the judge was a child , but i only saw a child .
and one night , i couldn &apos;t tell you that one day , if you want to judge someone else .
it was brian skerry , a judge .
you &apos;re not available .
because i had to sleep , i don &apos;t know , i started to do a bill .
i was a young black man , a black child .
and i started my proposal : the headline was , &quot; i was a proposal to be a black child , and i wanted to be a white collar . &quot;
and in this proposal , i said , &quot; the police department , and the police department .
and the court said that the legislatures are full of  UNK  .
the next morning , i woke up and i woke up the next day , and i wrote this proposal ?
it &apos;s terrifying , i don &apos;t know it .
and over the past few months .
and i ended up with my gosh , i had to do this .
i felt very nervous -- i was very nervous .
i got to drive the car .
i &apos;m thinking , this is going to be  UNK  .
and finally , i finally got out of the car , and i went down .
when i got a man on the stair .
and he saw me , and he asked him , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; yes , sir ? &quot;
and the  UNK  came up to me .
he &apos;s going to see me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
i have to admit that i have a little bit of a needle and a little bit .
and he reminded me that i was reminded of myself that i should remind myself that everyone should be able to make a better place .
so i ran into court .
i went to the judge , and i saw the judge .
&quot; mr.  UNK  , sir ? &quot;
i said , &quot; sir , sir , i said , &quot; we began . &quot;
people come in , because they were angry .
i did have a lot of fun things .
the police officer came in and the prosecutors were perfectly .
i didn &apos;t go back to the whole side , and i was angry at all , because we were talking about race .
i was walking around the corner , walking around the corner .
he looked at the  UNK  and looked at the  UNK  .
he goes like this .
finally , the black guy came in , and i was sitting in the background , i was sitting there .
and after the judge proposal .
and during the break , you feel like the  UNK  .
the vice chairman says ,  UNK  up to the  UNK  .
and say , &quot; what are you doing ? &quot;
this black guy stands up to see this black man , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to come up with this young black guy , and he looked at it , and look at it . &quot;
i &apos;m here today because i believe that there are a lot of people who understand this moral sense of the world , despite the  UNK  towards the  UNK  .
before we start to care about human rights and human rights .
every single person and survival depends on survival .
in our technology , design and the future of creativity and human creativity and human creativity and human ingenuity , and justice .
and the most important thing is that everyone is that i want you to see , and i want you to look at it .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to hear the audience , you see this audience , and you want to help , you want to do this .
what would you write a check check out ?
brian skerry : a lot of opportunities .
for example , if you &apos;re living in california , you &apos;re going to have a referendum in california , which is a lot of money that we spent on .
for instance , in california , we &apos;re going to spend 100 billion dollars .
at the same time , there &apos;s no adequate .
fifty percent of  UNK  .
it &apos;s a referendum .
and this is bringing the money into the security community and security guards .
and i think we can help .
in the last three decades of crime rates in america .
some of the reason is that some of the incarceration rate .
how would you say , &quot; how would you talk about this ?
brian skerry : fewer crime rates .
this country rises up in this country is not a violent crime rate .
it was abused by drug abuse .
and that &apos;s the main reason that we &apos;re going to go up .
we got to stand out to be  UNK  .
and we have three million people who were able to take a little bit of  UNK  , because we stole a little bit more than a  UNK  or a  UNK  .
i believe that we need to give people more money to help them .
i want to think of criminal justice .
i think it should change that .
brian greene , brian skerry : you have a gun .
it &apos;s an inspiring guy .
thank you very much . thank you .
after bin laden : after bin laden .
two  UNK  : the police came out of somalia .
four : a sinister problem .
six million people  UNK  : seven people dying .
UNK  : the tsunami of tsunami .
number two : mass destruction , mass extinctions .
the recession , egypt , syria , egypt , syria , syria .
crisis , death .
oh my god !
peter diamandis : this is the last six months that i &apos;ve collected some video in the past six years .
the highlight of the news is that we tend to focus on the negative information .
and of course , the brain is important .
we collect a lot of sensors , collect vast quantities of information , and we &apos;re not able to deal with the brain .
and there is no more important information than that is to survive , and all the information is the temporal lobe .
the brain is an early indicator of the early warning system .
it &apos;s going to take all the information , and it &apos;s possible .
so whenever we open up the newspaper , we don &apos;t read all sorts of negative information .
that &apos;s about the past , the headline : &quot; the headline is &quot; well .
and now we have all sorts of devices , we have all the time .
no wonder that &apos;s no wonder .
but maybe .
it &apos;s not acceptable , we are receiving distorted .
we have a whole series of events in the 20th century , a huge impact on the speed of progress is accelerating , in fact , the next 30 years , and we have a possibility of creating a possibility of creating a possibility .
and i &apos;m not talking about the climate crisis -- the climate crisis of water , and the energy crisis .
as human beings , we were very good at the end , but we eventually get rid of them .
let &apos;s go back to the last century , and what &apos;s going on in the last century .
over the last hundred years , the average lifespan of the last hundred times more than the average income per person over the world .
infant mortality dropped significantly .
food costs , electricity , traffic costs , cost , 10 times cheaper .
steve pointed out that we are living in human history .
and there &apos;s a lot of the world that &apos;s past 1.3 percent of the past 25 years .
we live in a great age .
but a lot of people forget this .
and we expect that the more high expectations are high .
in fact , we &apos;ve changed the meaning of poverty .
now , most of the americans today are living in the united states today , most people still have access to the air conditioning , the air conditioning , and the air conditioning on the air conditioning .
this was the most passionate  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  planet , never imagined .
and this is the basic science of technology .
my friend of mine emailed his friend will show any of any information technology , and this is going to be the following year .
and that &apos;s why you do something in your pocket of the phone call , and it &apos;s cheaper .
look at this curve .
this is the last hundred years of moore &apos;s law .
i want you to notice that &apos;s what i want .
first , it &apos;s very , very smooth -- no matter whether it &apos;s bad or bad or peace .
and that &apos;s because computers are used to make computers faster .
it &apos;s not going to be a huge challenge .
although on the left is the curve , it &apos;s still the curve upward .
technology accelerates itself faster and faster .
and moore &apos;s law is a set of curves for a whole range of  UNK  .
cloud computing , i call a friend of mine , which is what we call a sensor network sensor ; it allows us to print a worldwide network of personalized medicine , to make a new vaccine for personalized medicine and personalized medicine , new medicines , synthetic medicine and synthetic medicine , new medicines , new medicines , new medicines , new medicine ; artificial intelligence , new medicine ;
how many of you see ibm watson got watson to get watson on the computer in jeopardy ?
that &apos;s great .
i looked at the headline of news headlines , i think the best news headlines .
i like to say , &quot; jeopardy &quot;
it &apos;s not an easy game .
the key to understand that the human language is subtle .
you can imagine , like this is the kind of calculating intelligence , and all of the people who have a telephone .
four years ago , at ted , and i started a new university , and i started a new university . &quot;
we teach students how technology intersect human students to solve these problems .
every year we asked our students to build a company or a product or a product that we can actually create a positive impact on a diet .
imagine a bunch of students today can impact on a billion people .
30 years ago , it sounds ridiculous .
so today we can have some companies today .
and when i think about it , i &apos;m not going to create a likelihood of human life on earth , it &apos;s possible to create a possibility of life .
it &apos;s scarce resources , scarce resources .
it &apos;s a relative power of technology .
let me give you an example .
this is a story of napoleon &apos;s in the middle of the  UNK  .
he &apos;s on the left .
invited to dinner .
napoleon got napoleon &apos;s got napoleon &apos;s backyard , and napoleon &apos;s own .
but the king of  UNK  .
aluminum metal was the most expensive metals in the world , and the most expensive metals .
and that &apos;s why the tip of aluminum .
even the aluminum metal shaft of light on earth .
it &apos;s a combination of oxygen or  UNK  .
but then there was a technology that made aluminum shell so affordable , so that we were looking at  UNK  .
let &apos;s apply this metaphor to other systems .
let &apos;s think about energy .
ladies and gentlemen , our lives on this planet , we &apos;re living on average living on average energy consumption .
so each of the energy bonanza in the united states .
the problem isn &apos;t energy , it &apos;s scarcity .
now , there &apos;s good news .
this year is the cost of solar power in india , the cost of fossil fuels .
it costs half the cost of solar power .
last month , a research report came to a report in the u.s.
if we have a clean energy , we &apos;ll clean water .
so let &apos;s go down to the war .
do you remember that ? in 1990 , carl  UNK   UNK  spaceship earth is going to saturn in the spaceship earth .
what is a picture of a famous picture ?
the pale dot . &quot;
because we live on a planet . &quot;
70 percent of the surface of water .
it &apos;s 1.5 percent , percent of the sea , percent of the world , and we are still in the world .
there &apos;s a technology that is not prepared for the next 10 years .
there &apos;s a technology .
today , i &apos;m a big diy maker movement , and i want to tell you that i want to share some of the things that i &apos;ve been developing , and he said , &quot; well , maybe a little bit of a big room , and it might be a big room .
every single day water , water from any water , supplies , water supply , clean water supplies , 20 cents per day .
coke &apos;s recently , you &apos;re in the developing world , &quot; mass in developing countries .
if it &apos;s successful , i &apos;m going to be successful , it will be a global supply against coke .
that &apos;s the current presence of today .
we &apos;re looking at this .
my god , where i &apos;m going to be in the end of the developing world .
imagine a soldier in the middle of kenya .
if they &apos;re using smartphones , google , they &apos;re going to get 15 years ago .
they live in a world where nobody can predict the past , nobody can predict the past .
but also , we &apos;ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars a gps tracking -- gps tracking ,  UNK  and diagnostics , and the  UNK  ,  UNK  , and you &apos;re not a fan of the telephone .
and this is probably the best part of medicine .
i &apos;m honored to be an honor and announce that it &apos;s a  UNK  device .
and the challenges that the team around the world are bringing technology to the mobile devices , and you can talk to you , because you can have the hands of it , or the  UNK  , or  UNK  .
it &apos;s going to win prizes . you need to provide a better diagnostic test than a group of physicians .
imagine this device is missing in the medical application , which is 1.3 percent of the burden of disease .
if you look at this device , or the dna sequence of dna , it can &apos;t recognize the first disease control for the first time .
and there &apos;s also the most powerful forces of the world .
i call it a billion people . &quot;
the white line is the white line .
on earth &apos;s more than 70 billion .
by the way , by the way , the way , the best way to get educated .
in 2010 , we have 20 billion people in 2010 .
by 2020 , the internet users will get from the internet .
there are three billion people who are not going to be involved in the global conversation .
what do they want ?
what are they going to be their wish ?
we &apos;re going to be the biggest economic vitality , and the economy is not a recession .
these hundred billion people represent billion dollars a hundred billion dollars of global economy .
they &apos;re going to use the device , and they will become healthier , because it &apos;s become increasingly  UNK  , because it &apos;s becoming increasingly unlimited , and over time , and over the age of the  UNK  .
thirty billion people , who are engaged in education ?
we &apos;ve never been touched .
and there are other people who are attracted to other people , or for the first time .
what about 30 ?
maybe we &apos;re not even the foreseeable future ?
i experienced a little bit in the x prize , and the clarity of purpose , and passion , and passionate commitment to reach the past .
let me share a story with a very exciting story , very exciting story .
some of you may have heard this project .
it &apos;s a game called  UNK  game .
it comes from seattle .
it &apos;s an analysis to get a specific sequence , and it turns out to be able to analyze how the protein is folding .
and the way it has decided to organize the structure of the amino acids .
it &apos;s very important .
until now , it &apos;s a computer at the moment .
this game is played .
and then there are hundreds of people coming online game .
it &apos;s also going to show that the human mind is still the best form of computers .
and when you get the best of the protein folding , it &apos;s not a professor at mit , instead of graduate from mit , it &apos;s from manchester university , california .
ladies and gentlemen , i gave a huge challenge of confidence , we are being challenged by a challenge of all over the world .
we have fast tools and technology .
it &apos;s also passionate inventors .
you have the ability to be the ability .
and there &apos;s also a couple of online users , and we &apos;ve got to solve the challenges that we have to do .
we &apos;re about a decade .
thank you .
i think in the culture of medicine today , there &apos;s a culture that has to change .
and this can change from a doctor , and that &apos;s my doctor .
maybe it &apos;s because i &apos;ve been able to give up , and i could start to change this .
let &apos;s go into the theme . let &apos;s talk about baseball .
why ?
the end of the season , the world &apos;s going to be about baseball .
are we all love baseball ?
there are thousands of  UNK  in the world .
let &apos;s make statistics .
and the film is going to be &quot; the film about how the data is going to be based on how to build a big data .
i want to talk to you about a data .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
and when we said , we hit goliath , hit the ball .
we mean , this was very , very , very , very , very , very , very , and you have three times .
ann friedman called  UNK   UNK  , and knocked unconscious , and it &apos;s not going to die , and the ball doesn &apos;t run before the ball hits the ball , and it &apos;s time .
the 10 times .
you know , how the baseball scouts came out of the baseball bat ?
fantastic performer , fantastic performer .
you know what they &apos;re going to do with them .
and that &apos;s what the game was going to hit the  UNK  .
it &apos;s a tale of the tale of the two legends of a baseball -- he &apos;s the last baseball game .
now let me go back to the field of medicine .
suppose you have to remove the  UNK  , and then you remove the surgeon from a  UNK  surgery .
it sounds strange , right ?
suppose you &apos;re living in a remote regions where you live in a remote area of love , and you &apos;re going to be a doctor in your doctor &apos;s doctor , and she said , &quot; you know , she had a cardiologist calls &quot; a cardiologist in a cardiologist . &quot;
but , do you know , you know ?
she had a lot of this year , she &apos;s improving the quality of recovery .
she goes up to the top of the bat .
but it can &apos;t be acceptable .
and i want to ask you a question .
you think , a doctor , or a surgeon , a surgeon who is a surgeon in an emergency surgeon , but what the doctor should the doctor ?
okay ? very good .
in fact , nobody knows that the medical expertise in the medical community , or the surgeon should be in emergency . &quot;
we &apos;re going to send them to my own jobs , and i asked them to give their own jobs .
it &apos;s absolutely not possible to make mistakes -- but we don &apos;t think about ourselves , but let &apos;s think about how it is possible .
and that &apos;s when i got medical school .
i am an autistic student .
in a high school student , brian skerry took a blood test .
and i did .
and i was in this far from the toronto , a nurse in my attic .
i &apos;ve got everything .
i talked about dissection without the dissection of the  UNK  and  UNK  , and the way that every single one extension of the aorta .
i don &apos;t even know how to identify differences .
and during that time , i was accumulating more and more and more of the time .
well , i &apos;m pretty good grades .
and when i came out of medical school , i think , i get all the stuff -- i get all of the stuff -- almost all of my medical errors .
and i had no mistakes in a period of time .
and the woman brought into a hospital in toronto , when i was a resident in toronto , and i was working there .
and i was thrown in a cardiologist .
my work is when i work , the ambulance needs of the people who need to be diagnosed with a professional patient .
and after the surgeon , i was responsible for the rest of my life .
when i met her , i met her , she was very weak .
when i was talking to her , i hear her voices , i hear her voices .
and when i was listening to the stethoscope on the left , i was talking about the flames , and i told that &apos;s the heart of failure .
this is a heart failure rate of heart failure , and it can cause all the blood of the blood pumped back into the heart of blood .
it &apos;s not a difficult diagnosis .
and when i started to help her .
i gave her aspirin , she gave her aspirin , she could give her heart disease burden .
and i made a little bit of a sanitary pad , and she &apos;s going to help her .
in the next couple of hours , she started getting better .
i was happy .
and then i made a mistake : i made her first mistake .
the right thing is , i &apos;ve made two mistakes .
i was before my house and i went back to her home .
i didn &apos;t have to do that , i should take the phone , and i &apos;ll give him a phone call , and i &apos;ll give him an opportunity to meet a patient .
and i met her , so she knew that she could read details .
maybe i have to do that .
maybe i don &apos;t want to be a guide .
maybe you can see , i don &apos;t need to take care of his patients .
and the second big mistake .
when she went home , i ignored her voice , i was trying to tell you , &quot; i &apos;m trying to tell you , &quot; don &apos;t do that . &quot;
well , i was so confident that i was so confident that i didn &apos;t even take care of her nurse , and she said , &quot; are you going to get home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought , &quot; well , then the nurse says , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think , &quot; hmm . &quot;
it was yesterday , i was like yesterday .
and i was signed up with a bucket list , and when she came to the emergency room .
and i went back to my work .
in the next day , the gut afternoon , and i had a gut feeling like a gut feeling .
but i still work .
and after the end of my work , i left the hospital , i left the hospital .
i borrowed from emergency .
and there was another nurse , a nurse , who was not a woman , who said to me that my doctor was scared to me .
the other doctors are scared , but the fear of the three doctors are scared , because we look at the three doctors .
this is three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember home ? &quot;
and the nurse asked the nurse .
&quot; she came back and she came back .
she came back .
it &apos;s coming back .
after i got home , she went back to about an hour after 9 / 11 , and she went back on the floor , and she brought her back to the emergency room .
she &apos;s breathing very , very weak .
they had  UNK  .
they gave her her her blood pressure .
and she connects her to her  UNK  .
and i was shocked .
and then i felt like a  UNK  , because when they &apos;re doing it , because when she was in the emergency room , she would send her in the icu .
but in the next two or three days , she wakes up and she wakes up in three days .
her brain has been damaged by the brain injury .
her family was together .
in the next nine days of nine days , they had come to accept this .
in the  UNK  , she left to leave the woman -- her mother , a woman .
someone will never forget you .
and that &apos;s the first time i realized that reality .
and over the course of a couple weeks , i was frustrated , and the first time that i had experienced in the culture of medicine -- i &apos;m not alone .
that &apos;s the kind of -- when you say that the  UNK  will agree with me , and he said , &quot; you know , he said , &quot; you know , the best friend of mine , you know , although you &apos;re not going to tell me that the end of the  UNK  .
and , you &apos;ve done the promise , and then you &apos;re going to be  UNK  .
it &apos;s kind of shame .
and i &apos;m talking about that i &apos;m talking about you .
it &apos;s right , you &apos;re not doing it , you &apos;re wrong , but you &apos;re bad guys .
this is my feeling .
and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m not very good .
and he talked to me about his family . and he had to make sure that i had no intention .
but i still kept asking myself to questions .
why didn &apos;t i have connection to me ? why did she go home ?
when i was frustrated , i asked myself , why am i doing so stupid ?
why would i go into medicine ?
slowly , but stable it was stable .
and i began to think about it .
and then in a time , when i saw the sunlight in the sun , i saw the sunlight .
and then i made myself a perfect  UNK  , and if i do something wrong , i &apos;m not going to make perfect sound .
that voice does stop .
i went back to jobs .
but it &apos;s wrong again .
two years later , when i was in a hospital in the north part of toronto , and i looked at my throat .
so , i was busy , so i was busy .
he kept over here .
i looked at his throat , some of his throat .
i gave him a recipe for his prescription from his prescription .
even if he walked out of the door of his door , he looks at his throat .
and two days later , i was on the emergency room for me .
and she said three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember that your throat ? &quot;
it turns out that he didn &apos;t have sex .
it &apos;s a threat to the conditions of life .
you can see , you know , but it &apos;s not an  UNK  , but it &apos;s not  UNK  .
luckily , he passed away .
and over the course of antibiotics , he gave him a few days later .
and i went back to that i went back to the time and  UNK  , and then i went back to the time , and then i went back to the  UNK  again .
and in the same case , i &apos;ve found that there was no patient .
it &apos;s hard to imagine what happens when a patient is a hospital , especially when you &apos;re a hospital in a hospital in a hospital .
and for two cases , i was going to get home , and i don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to take care of treatment and treatment .
one of them i was diagnosed with him .
and then the kidney is normal , but my colleagues at the time , i was doing the right side of the patient .
the other patient has severe diarrhea .
and i gave him some liquid water , and he helped me to see it .
it &apos;s done . when he noticed that the patient &apos;s soft , he was connected to the surgeon .
this patient has done surgery .
but every time i thought that those two weeks ago , i was tortured .
and i hope that i &apos;ll tell you that i &apos;ll tell you that the worst kind of mistake that i &apos;ve only been named for five years ago .
in the last five years , i &apos;ve made some mistakes .
i still feel lonely , lonely .
but the question is : if i can &apos;t talk about the subject of the things that i can &apos;t tell you that i can &apos;t tell you that i can &apos;t tell you that i can tell you how my colleagues that i can tell you how to share my experience ?
how do i teach them how to make them false ?
when i walked into a room -- i was like , i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m going to see you .
when you hear people talk about yourself talking about yourself , what is it ?
it &apos;s a party , if you go to a party , you might listen to some other sorts of errors , but you &apos;re not going to talk about yourself , but somebody you &apos;re not going to talk about yourself .
if i walked into my room , i was full of room full of attention , and i &apos;m going to ask them to tell you , and i &apos;m going to tell you that story , and i &apos;m not going to tell them , and they &apos;re going to start a conversation .
in fact , if i was in my colleagues , i know , a colleague of dr.  UNK   UNK   UNK  , i believe that when i met him .
that &apos;s what we have the system .
it &apos;s completely wrong .
there are only two types of people who are being wrong with people who don &apos;t have mistakes ; they can live and terrible results .
it &apos;s almost like an immune system that respond to people like attacking the person &apos;s first .
we have an idea : when we &apos;re going to be able to come out of the medical system , we get the medical system .
but the idea will come up with two problems .
in my first medical training medical news , i work from toronto , and i went from toronto , and i went from &quot;  UNK  , and i was able to study the medical field of medicine .
and what i learned is that the mistakes i &apos;ve learned is .
we &apos;re working on a day at a hospital every day in a hospital .
in this country , there are nearly four million people who died in canada .
in the united states , at the academy of statistics , the number of  UNK  .
even so even if you look at the same data , because we &apos;ve never been able to look at this .
the point is .
in the last three years , we have a doubling every hospital in three years , we can &apos;t go after the system .
it &apos;s an absolute scenario .
and we can &apos;t get rid of that .
we have our intuitions about ourselves from the consequences of our own conclusions .
but if the same time that this guy was made a little bit of  UNK  of alcohol , you know , i wrote a little bit of  UNK  , and he wrote a little bit of  UNK  .
and that &apos;s completely different .
i &apos;m not going to be doing the same thing .
my patient is not a car , they &apos;re not going to describe their symptoms .
so it &apos;s inevitable .
if i was taught to teach all the things that i &apos;ve been taught to go wrong with a professional field .
and there are people who don &apos;t want to talk about the worst mistake .
and in my case , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to be the worst effect , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to pass it . &quot;
the pupils dilate their pupils dilate , they &apos;re going to be able to see the floor , and they start to see me starting to tell their story .
they want to tell their story , they also want to share their stories .
they would say , &quot; listen to sounds like me , &quot; i &apos;m wrong . &quot;
they &apos;re just going to be  UNK  .
they need to reimagine a medical definition of medicine .
from a surgeon from individual doctors .
the definition of physicians are wrong , and she knows that she knows that she &apos;s the fact that she doesn &apos;t think about it .
she &apos;s going to share with others .
and when people talk about yourself talking about ourselves .
she doesn &apos;t have a kind of mindset that only has been able to make a sense of the benefit of everybody else .
and she goes to work , and she admit that the whole system of the entire system , and when it &apos;s a system that &apos;s only a mistake .
and that system can continue to evolve to be able to avoid being able to avoid being able to avoid being able to avoid being able to avoid being able to deal with the environment , and to encourage everyone to see the impact of the human health system .
i was brian skerry brian skerry .
i &apos;m a physician .
i &apos;m a human , i &apos;m going to be wrong .
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m going to try to learn how to do it .
i still don &apos;t know how to see me , but i want to accept that .
and finally , i made my own three words : i remember myself .
and in the 20th century , if you have a communist league table , you have to go to the back office .
you have to have a piece of paper that is a text .
and this is where the government can follow .
and if they found a piece of paper that they can make mistakes .
and in the west can &apos;t understand how it can be possible to do this kind of thing .
we &apos;ll never do that in our own country .
but in 2011 today , if you buy a laser printer , you buy a laser printer from a printer print laser printer , you know , the last page of the paper that you have a page on the page , you &apos;re going to make a unique piece of paper .
that &apos;s what happened to us today .
it seemed to be not surprisingly .
this is an example of how we use our government to deal with our citizens .
and this is one of the three big sources of three .
if we look at the world , what &apos;s happening in the world .
we have three major groups .
we have online criminals .
well , there &apos;s a gentleman from maidan .
online criminals are easily understood .
these guys .
they made a lot of money , lots of money .
we actually have a couple of cases , and we &apos;re making a lot of money .
and this is from estonia ,  UNK  .
this is a man of his  UNK  .
this is stephen hawking .
this is  UNK  .
this is a silver lining , etc . , etc .
these are people making a lot of money , but they &apos;re making money available online , and when we &apos;re using the bank account of our credit card , or whatever we &apos;re using our credit card or card information , and when we use our credit card information on our credit card .
the united states , two months ago , the u.s. military  UNK  , mr.  UNK   UNK  in switzerland , and the bank accounts on the bank accounts of  UNK  .
sir , mr. teszler himself ; he knows he knows where he knows .
i &apos;m going to argue that today that there is any kind of online crime and even beyond the victims .
and it &apos;s clearly getting worse .
now , most online crime will happen .
the second type of attack today , we &apos;re not looking at money .
and the reason is because of this is because of the protest , for reason to be  UNK  .
these anonymous are anonymous in the past 12 months , and they become an active participants .
so these are three key : the money for the money to attack anonymous , anonymous , the end of anonymous , and the last three tribe , the last group of governments .
so let &apos;s look at companies like this .
this is a typical example of attack .
this is a certificate of a certificate , or the dutch authority .
it was last fall in last year , because they had collapsed .
it was completely destroyed .
i was asked the last week of the meeting , and i asked him if i asked him whether or someone died .
he replied , &quot; yes .
so , how do people die ?
it &apos;s a certificate .
they sell certificate .
what do you do ?
you need a certificate . you have a certificate , and you have a service ,  UNK  service , and encryption services .
now , most of us , most people who use it to be used in any country in any country , in particular country , especially in iran , particularly in iran , especially in iran , because they know what they &apos;re doing is more reliable than the local government , and they &apos;re not talking about the local government , and they &apos;re not talking about the local government .
they can also attack if they attacked a certificate .
UNK  .
that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case .
what &apos;s happening ? for example , what &apos;s happening ?
in egypt , the thugs of egypt , the headquarters of egypt , in 2011 .
there &apos;s a file called  UNK  , a  UNK  named his hooks .
his notebook took a bunch of notes from a german company to the egyptian government , which is a tool to send a country to a communications device .
they took a million euros of a million euros of the egyptian government .
companies are in the headquarters .
so , the western governments have the tools to provide their own citizens .
but they also do the same for themselves .
for example , in germany , a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago called  UNK  , the official inquiry .
if you &apos;re a robbery , you know , the name of the suspect of your suspect .
but today , things are already surpassed .
they will monitor foreigners .
they &apos;re going to use a tool to use a tool to use this to be able to use a computer , and you &apos;ll let them talk about all sorts of communications , and you &apos;re talking about the code .
so , when we think about the things that people respond to this kind of reaction , &quot; well , it &apos;s bad , because it &apos;s legitimate , but i &apos;m not going to be true .
why am i worried ?
i &apos;m not going to hide . &quot;
that &apos;s where there &apos;s no argument .
privacy is an  UNK  .
privacy matters .
it &apos;s not a security problem .
it &apos;s an issue of freedom .
we &apos;re going to be trust in 2011 , we will never give up our government .
we will not trust the future of trust , the government , trust , a government ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to worry about the next 50 years .
it sounds a little bit odd , i &apos;m a  UNK  lover .
the first  UNK  is made from a very simple idea : a fixed set of ideas together to make a fixed block .
soon it became the most widely used around the world .
it allows us to make much more than ourselves , the bridge , and it &apos;s like this .
it &apos;s essentially what we became the era of the  UNK  .
after about 100 years , in &apos; 47 .
it was called  UNK  .
and in just a few years , the lego kit of a family .
it &apos;s estimated that it &apos;s been estimated that we &apos;ve built over four billion dollars per person per person .
you don &apos;t have to be a beautiful building bridges .
legos will make lego .
the lego is the lego kit of the lego kit that we built into the building blocks of building blocks .
and at the same bell labs , at bell labs , at bell labs are going to release the next generation .
the transistor is a little bit of smaller plastic , and we put the bricks that could pull up onto the whole new world .
like  UNK  , you can use it as a transistor is a transistor for a more complex , more complicated circuit .
but there &apos;s a major difference : only the touch of the specialists .
i can &apos;t accept that we can make the decision that only can make the decision , so i decided to make decisions .
when i was eight years ago at the media lab , i started thinking about how engineers could be able to create a unique artist .
a few years ago , i developed a few years ago .
i &apos;m going to show you how to play .
the electron is a function of an electron microscope .
they &apos;re all set up to the motor vehicle sensors , or the sensors .
and the great thing is that they &apos;re using a magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic field .
so it &apos;s impossible .
these little bits are colored colors .
the green output is blue , blue , the color is the pink blue blob .
so what you need to do need to do is get to get the green .
it &apos;s blue , you get a call your green lights .
you can put it in the middle of the middle there .
removes the pattern , the pulse , and you &apos;ve created a little  UNK  .
add that up to the noise that you create a machine .
i had to have a  UNK  .
except , in fact , the function of the  UNK  .
no , you don &apos;t need to program computers , you can use your intuition .
so , for example , or take a little bit of slow , you just need to move this slowly .
and after the following idea was that this was growing up .
we want to think of the world that every single one of the world &apos;s bricks could do .
light , the motors , the motors -- the motors should be  UNK  .
we used to show kids to play and watch them .
it &apos;s an incredible experience .
and the great thing that they start to understand the electricity that they &apos;re not learning .
so , for example , how to get the ipod and how to touch the ipod , or how do you respond to the ipod .
we used to bring it to design school .
so , for example , we had no experience with no designer , no designer &apos;s  UNK  .
you can see , you can see a piece of paper and ...
so a few weeks ago , we went to design a little bit of engineering college , and it &apos;s not just a piece of paper -- and they said , &quot; what they do . &quot;
and that &apos;s a program that they &apos;re doing a project .
so , in fact , this is my favorite project .
it &apos;s a lobster claw . it &apos;s a lobster .
and the technician , the technician becomes a material , and the other materials .
and we wanted to make this kind of material .
so open source is open-source .
you can download all the files , all the formats .
we want to encourage all people , inventors , inventors , inventors , the inventors of the world .
don &apos;t start to think about it .
thank you .
