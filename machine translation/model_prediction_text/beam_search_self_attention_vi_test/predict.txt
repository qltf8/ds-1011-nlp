how can i tell you about 10 minutes of the threads that connect through these three generations of women who have taught her life span about the same life that same force for her life , about four years old , her life in the same way that she turned up to the same mycelial mat on the day in seven years ago , she raised her life in the same life that she &apos;s 6 years ago , and she was talking to the girl who i &apos;d never talk to the woman who &apos;s lives in the
this story doesn &apos;t end .
it &apos;s a game called the puzzle .
let me tell you about some pieces .
imagine a very strong man , a career man who actually burn my career .
he was the poet , the playwright , the entire life of the only people in the country that the only freedom of your country .
imagine , a communist he who was a communist , facing the fact that he was faced his entire life .
my words , the last year was making fun of  UNK  , come out of making fun .
he retreat into silence .
he died ,  UNK  history .
he was my grandfather .
i never met him outside .
but our lives more than we record in the memory of these experiences .
she never allowed me to forget my life .
my mission is not to get through the life of my life , and the lesson is that i learned , yes , we have already been suffering , we have suffered .
the next piece of the puzzle is an early dusk in dusk .
my mother , every 18 years old , my mother had lost her family -- an arranged marriages , an arranged marriages , there were two daughters before .
for her life , the only mission : the only family to get off and started to escape australia .
she never accept mothers won &apos;t be successful .
so after four years , an  UNK  away from the  UNK  for a boat , a  UNK  ship .
all the adult risks .
the biggest fear of encountering pirates , and death .
like most adults on the boat , i carry a bottle message in a small bottle .
if we were being arrested , and i was my mother , and then i &apos;ll drink her .
the earliest memories of childhood are made from a big boat -- the peer review of the boat , the  UNK  of every boat , the waves of the air .
i didn &apos;t remember getting rid of all of the time , but it was moved by the cold , because the men of the boat , when the men died on the ship strike .
but i remembered gate after gate came from a jug of oil , one of the man that he died , and ended up with his money , and ended up with his first route , and i was created on the first floor , the men that i created on their construction workers , which i was created on their foot .
it doesn &apos;t make any good .
after she spent months in the camp , we set our foot .
and the next piece of the picture is about four women , together , three generations .
we settled on the suburbs of the suburbs took over and over the country .
it doesn &apos;t look like the suburbs for the middle class , but i don &apos;t know that there &apos;s no water right at  UNK  .
nose from the shops all over the world .
and it &apos;s broken english in the conversation between the  UNK  of the human being  UNK  , they &apos;re starting to break it from .
my mother worked in the farm , and then in the production line , worked on both the day .
so my mother still takes time to learn english and take all the information technology .
we &apos;re very poor .
each money has been spent on any money and learn to speak english and achieve all of their own wine , except for all the time ; it &apos;s clothes , and we &apos;re all clothes .
two teams to learn to go to school , in order to cover his team .
a uniform  UNK  , because i had a strong preference for six years .
occasionally , i hear , i hear  UNK  make a  UNK  car on the wall , &quot; and sometimes i would have a  UNK  , the asian door . &quot;
where housing ?
there &apos;s a little bit of me .
the determination is from a non-invasive and non-invasive , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to zip through a new cycle . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i sleep in a bed .
and my mother would exhausted , but we tell the stories of listening to the  UNK  and hear me around the house .
my mother was scared of a nightmare .
my mission was to get to get from my mother was scared .
my mother had a computer shop and an aesthetic and a business facility .
and then the told the women of their stories about men and women who couldn &apos;t fit their lives ,  UNK  and every child in the world .
we search for funding and funded the sponsors .
the institutions were built .
i live in two worlds .
in one of the world , i &apos;m a tough , traveling with ourselves .
in the world , i had a really strong living in tragic , not because violence , addiction and perfectly accidents .
but over the years i &apos;ve been able to help .
and because of that work , when i was the senior year , i was elected to vote in australia .
and i get the pieces from this morning , but they don &apos;t mix together .
the anonymous meeting , the anonymous area of  UNK  , which is the  UNK  , and activist and social activities , where everybody has never been able to go into new places that have never existed before .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know how to  UNK  .
i don &apos;t know about wine .
i don &apos;t know what about .
i want to get a thing about the day of life and  UNK  in the suburbs -- should be a mother and ended up with a mother and ended up over 20 years , and over the next 20 years to sleep during a day , and during the sleep disruption .
i told my mother was that i couldn &apos;t do .
my mother is now that i &apos;m also by my mother .
he said , &quot; never an option .
&quot; keep doing it , &quot; and she said , &quot; don &apos;t be true . &quot;
so i &apos;m talking about young men and education , and education , about the social  UNK  , abandoned and the loss of interest in the right and abandoned and abandoned and interest .
and i said , i was really , the more i was told .
i meet people from social new social class , many people who are working on their own personal favorite opportunity .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t hear the law .
the fold in half .
and at the same time i &apos;m also  UNK  .
because being true in your body vulnerability to be narrowed key to your somewhat easily .
now i &apos;ve come out of the safe zones to know , to know that , yes , it may not collapse .
but the possibilities that never won &apos;t be allowed to be encouraging .
there &apos;s an amazing alternative energy , which is a really bizarre source of humility and .
so i got to follow my hunch .
i was collected a small team with something we can &apos;t do a compelling challenge .
for a year we were penniless last .
at all day , i do a huge soup tonight too .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas are insane , but some of the ideas , and we created a breakthrough .
i decided to make an american problem .
after a trip .
it &apos;s a hunch .
three months after i moved on and moved on .
before i finish , let me tell you about three .
she grew up in the age of which is the  UNK  and the biosphere .
life was like this for centuries .
her father died three days after she was born .
her mother was alone .
when she was 17 , no more threat , he was his way to beat his wife .
and it was  UNK  for the support of her husband , she has to  UNK  the trial and he says he does over three months .
&quot; no , it &apos;s not being wrong .
i &apos;m in a center of a hotel room in sydney , it took over 600 miles away .
i looked at the eight and i see her on the other side .
i know she came to me to bye for me .
a few minutes later i call my mother .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in  UNK  , and sat there .
we tell stories and tell her , and she was always on three sides .
at midnight , and we were told us , and we had to shut them down .
she told us her hands .
my mother asked , &quot; why my mom &apos;s hand , &quot; my mom ? &quot;
&quot; because the light from the only three communicate .
&quot; not only  UNK  . &quot;
if we have a family in our resources , we passed the women .
because we are and who we shaped our lives , we now can see that the men who can come in our lives .
it will fail miserably .
now i also want to have kids , and i wonder .
anybody want their kids to go through their ship ?
but i fear  UNK  , fear of life , digital rights ownership .
could i get a really specific project where i made a really strong and every single one of the living , mr.  UNK  , the promise of nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it to me a peace and i will find my peace .
and yes , my mother &apos;s methane is just a year in the back or fourth row .
and it &apos;s been a privilege to be here and shared with me .
i had to go through the long time , after being spent prison and sentenced for death .
i also have experienced a long time in the communities of the people who have low-income backgrounds and say with despair .
and i came here , and i was encouraged to do it , and then i gave it a lot of my strength .
and one of the most remarkable things i realized that i was during the course of the time i was there for a ted .
and you can talk about a lot of things in the world .
and sometimes you come to ted , and it gives you the power to you if you don &apos;t have the power if you &apos;re not .
and i mention this because i think it &apos;s really important to think about identity .
we &apos;ve got some great examples .
and i think what we &apos;ve found is that , if you &apos;re a teacher , you say , what if you &apos;re a teacher , but if you &apos;re a rich source of compassion .
and if you &apos;re a doctor , you can do a few good things , but if you &apos;re a doctor , you can do a lot of good things .
that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity politics .
in fact , i didn &apos;t learn this as surgery or lawyers or do my job .
i actually learned this from my grandmother .
i grew up in a home , an american family and tradition in the african american traditional regime and my family was the control .
she got tough , strong and powerful in your family .
she was always a lovers &apos; family would end &apos; family .
and there &apos;s always been a lot of people out in the family .
mothers are actually the  UNK  .
she was born in  UNK  in virginia .
and she was born in 1880 , and this new  UNK  , which was the slave back to see that shapes .
three tough .
when i was a little girl , i looked at three and i would hug and hug him .
she was sick to me that i could barely breathe , and then she was leaving me .
or one two hours later , if i met her , i &apos;m going to go and say , &quot;  UNK  , still feel like a  UNK  ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; skin doesn &apos;t care , &quot; i &apos;m going to attack , &quot; and if i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to leave alone .
she has one of a character that you will always be in .
the only challenge was to get 10 .
my mother was  UNK  , home .
sometimes , i come and on the inside , but it &apos;s really hard to have time to be realistic .
my sisters  UNK  around me everywhere .
and i remember , at that time , i was about eight nine years old , and i woke up to me in the morning , and i was living rooms , and i see all around the room .
she was sitting on the opposite of the staring at me .
at first time , i was playing a game .
and then i looked at the end and she looked very serious .
15 minutes goes up with three days by hand , across the room with three words : &quot; whoa , my dad . &quot;
and i remember the printing press , just as it happened yesterday .
and i &apos;ll never forget .
she took me out of the room , and i said , &quot; hey , you will tell me , you &apos;re going to tell me you one who told me you were one . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , let &apos;s not make sure enough . &quot; i &apos;m sure . &quot;
and then she sat down , and i said , &quot; you want to know that she &apos;s always going to follow her leg . &quot;
&quot; she thought she was a kid . &quot;
&quot; she thought you can do everything i want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget about three words .
and she said , &quot; i promise you three things : &quot; ah , three things . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , &quot;
&quot; the first thing i want to promise is that your mother is always a &quot; your mother is your  UNK  .
he said , &quot; her daughter , her daughter will promise that your mother will always take care of your mother . &quot;
ah , i love my mom , so i promise , &quot; well , i will do a &quot; well . &quot;
&quot; the second thing that she wants to do is to do is to do the right thing to do .
i thought , &quot; well , you &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
she said , &quot; three things that are three or a promise that she won &apos;t ever drank alcohol . &quot;
well , at that time i was nine years old , i said , &quot; well , i promise . &quot;
i grew up in the south , and there is a big southern older brother and a sister that i was a little older than my sister .
by the way , i was 14 , and i remember my home , and i didn &apos;t know what he was , i didn &apos;t know where he was dragged me through the baby and her sister was coming out of the woods .
the fredrick the great we &apos;ve been doing these crazy things .
he took a bite of her out of beer and my sister and i gave them up to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no , no one day i &apos;m going to drink . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve been working today , and i &apos;ve been doing what you do and what he &apos;s doing . &quot;
he drinks a little girl , i had a little bit of my baby , and i said , &quot;
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel like that . &quot;
and then i looked at me and staring at me .
and she said , &quot; why do you do it ? &quot;
and he looked at me , &quot; oh , i would never bother him to talk too much about her , and her talk . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you saying ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; i tell you them that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was disappointed , i saw disappointing .
i want to admit you a thing .
the reason i should say i shouldn &apos;t say .
i know that this whole discussion will be broadly referred to the air .
however , i &apos;m still going to say , i &apos;m just going to admit that i had never drank a water .
it &apos;s not because i think it &apos;s right , so i think it &apos;s moral ; it &apos;s the power of humanity .
when we create a kind of thing that we can tell things around the world that we don &apos;t believe what they &apos;re truly means .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they don &apos;t do .
every time i think of , of course , she knew that all the children were especially .
my grandfather were from my grandfather were a  UNK  period of wine , wine , you &apos;ve brown .
he died due to a cause of alcohol .
and of course she thought , but what we need to commit .
well , i &apos;ve been telling people about the justice system of justice systems .
country , we &apos;ve taken a number of years ago with 40 years ago .
in 1972 ,  UNK  had been to 300,000 people were had been  UNK  .
today , that number is 2.3 million incarcerated today .
the united states is out of the highest in the world .
and there are seven million people being  UNK  or eight .
in my incarceration , in my incarceration , in this world has changed .
for poor people , the poor black people had this impact on them , who was afraid to let them go down .
it was three black men in the age of 18 to 30 , there was one of the people in prison , or  UNK  .
in these big cities in this country like los angeles , baltimore county , have to take 50 percent of the people in the condition of the same way , they &apos;re  UNK  out of the same way , or they &apos;re  UNK  out of the state .
our legal system is not only being shaped by the way , not only by racism , but only racism is also  UNK  by the way .
we &apos;re trying to make a justice system that is ready to spend a lot better if you &apos;re rich than poor crimes they are poor innocent .
it &apos;s wealth , not that i have to have the consequences .
despite that , though , we still seem to be comfortable .
fear and the courage and political anger , and it &apos;s not a problem and that we have to worry about .
so we isolate we isolate just separated the rest .
but this reminded me that interests me .
we &apos;re seeing some really interesting insights in our development .
i live in with alabama , like alabama , somebody &apos;s got something that would really be like the right to take you to get a child .
right now , there &apos;s this by 34 percent black men , black men are lost forever .
we predicted that 10 years pass phrase from the citizenship would have less to act like elections .
and there &apos;s a silent  UNK  silence .
i want to represent the child .
a lot of my cave was still very young .
the united states alone in the world has been 13 years old .
do we have a life of the  UNK  for children .
we &apos;re actually doing cases of lawsuits are out .
and the only country in the world does this .
i &apos;d like to speak up for those who slowly .
the question of death row is really interesting .
by many ways , we &apos;re taught to believe that the real question is whether people have to die ?
this is a very rational question .
but there &apos;s still another way of thinking about our heads in our personality .
the other way to think about this is not the  UNK  whether or not we have the right to kill them or not ?
i mean , incredible !
death penalty in the united states alone .
nine people get sentenced to prison find a innocent member of the innocent and from the  UNK  drop of innocent people from the smoke .
this is the rate of a sudden death toll among innocent people who convicted was innocent was innocent people .
it &apos;s incredible .
in any industry , we &apos;re never going to let people go off , if you took off to the plane .
but somehow we extract ourselves from this problem , we take ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not about our problem .
not our burden of our burden .
it &apos;s not something that we need to struggle .
i talk a lot about these problems .
and about race and question whether we &apos;re going to kill them .
and what &apos;s interesting is that i teach my students about the american history of the african american history , they told me about slavery .
terrorism -- this period began to collapse back to the world war ii and ended up after world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know about this .
but for the americans in this country , it was a terrible time .
many communities have been executed , the execution of  UNK  .
they were scared of bomb  UNK  .
and the main threats of terror management of their lives .
and those people came to me and said to me , &quot; mr.  UNK  , but he talks with us , talk to people with the most vulnerable people , to say to confront the first time , after 9 / 11 years of 9 / 11 , and after 9 / 11 years of 9 / 11 , and after 9 / 11 years .
so let &apos;s tell us that we had to grow up with that .
and of course , there &apos;s been  UNK  and ethnic  UNK  and the  UNK  race and gender .
we see reality is right now , but we don &apos;t want to leave our own problem .
we don &apos;t want to talk about history .
and so , we didn &apos;t understand what it means .
we &apos;re not constantly  UNK  conflicts today .
it &apos;s not stopping and power .
we &apos;ve been hard to talk about race , and i &apos;m sure that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to get the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people know they can &apos;t be resistant to the  UNK  , and they didn &apos;t commit to the truth and do it .
in rwanda , even after this bloody  UNK  has been brought to this kind of commit to this country , but we haven &apos;t done it yet .
i had some very serious papers at the expense of a death row .
it was amazing for my lecture , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m really excited to stand up and say , &quot; i &apos;m speaking at him . &quot;
&quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , we &apos;ll never have a death sentence in germany . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be silent as women said , &quot; in our history , we never got to get involved in trying to kill people .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s  UNK  or not a death should look at somebody . &quot;
and i think about this .
what would you feel like if you lived in a german world where pronounced  UNK  , especially when people were the death row , particularly  UNK  .
i cannot ignore it .
so it &apos;s so  UNK  .
in our country , at the south of the southern relatives who have been done the capacity for 11 times higher if they were the victims of the murder victim , if they were victims of the black men and women were victims who were likely to identify the men who were chosen for their bodies .
and therefore , there is something that separates the pest .
i think our character is being  UNK  away .
when we don &apos;t really care about things , it &apos;s not nice , but the nice thing that do is absolutely fine .
we like to love innovation .
love technology , like loves creative technology .
entertainment love to entertainment .
but finally , in fact , this is  UNK  by the distance ,  UNK  of  UNK  and  UNK  the  UNK  of morality .
and for me , the combination of all of these two things are actually necessary .
because we &apos;re also talking about the excitement of hope that we are much more and more engaged in pursuit of the key challenges in life , in this complicated world .
for me , that means to spend time thinking about how to think about the poor people , who have the circumstances , for those who have no circumstances for ted .
however , think about them to think about how to life itself .
you know , then finally , we finally have to believe in what we &apos;ve never seen before .
yeah . we &apos;re rational for ourselves .
innovation , creativity , innovation , and it &apos;s not only from where we are in our heads .
they come from all the ideas that are being energized .
and that &apos;s the connection of our hearts and minds , my head and the mind that i will not only pay attention to the light , but it &apos;s not only going to do great things .
professor , vaclav  UNK  , a big secret door , the talk about this .
&quot; when we were in eastern europe , we wanted to try to deal with all the things that we need to engage and coordinate and inform and sometimes be a state . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s about the core beliefs that i just visit the ted community i believe .
there is something that separates us from the technology that allows us to actually pay attention to the misery of poverty , not for anybody who is perceived as injustice and inequality and injustice .
now i &apos;m going to warn you that you have to have to have a lot of challenge as we don &apos;t pay attention to a lot .
but what if you just come .
i had a great privilege to be , when i was a lawyers to  UNK  park , where i met .
she used to park very much  UNK  and three times as the best friends of  UNK   UNK   UNK  , who started  UNK   UNK  the foundation of the  UNK  bus fleet of  UNK  , and  UNK   UNK   UNK  , a wonderful woman in virginia , who was a king  UNK  , a lawyers , dr. king  UNK  .
these women came to this side , and it &apos;s just talking about .
and every time she would call , she would call the  UNK  park , and she would go to the park , and we would come to talk to the town .
do you want to hear ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;ll go . &quot;
she said , &quot; so what are you going to do ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and then i went there , and i &apos;ll just listen to me .
it &apos;s so far from my strength for me so many .
there was one time and i heard a couple of hours and she said , &quot; come back to the bright and said , let me tell you about a petition for me .
and what he &apos;s trying to do . &quot;
so i have the  UNK  tongue .
&quot; well , we &apos;re changing the injustice .
we &apos;re trying to help people from conviction .
trying to deal with racism and discrimination in black , there was no justice at stake , at stake , at stake , justice .
trying to stop the kids who were sentenced for life ,  UNK  .
she &apos;s trying to do something about death , penalty .
a minority people are imprisonment , a  UNK  .
and the end of mass  UNK  . &quot;
when i said my  UNK  , she looked at me and said , &quot; well , um , &quot; well . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s going to get tired of you , tirelessly ,  UNK  . &quot;
and it was also three times when i put my hand , put my hand up and said , &quot; you must be courageous , and courageous . &quot;
i really think the ted community needs to be more courageous .
we need to figure out how to cope with the challenges , but it &apos;s hard to say to the injustice that it &apos;s caused injustice .
because after all , we depend on every single individual on this planet .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things to do when i do my work .
it taught me very simple things .
and i understand that and i believe that we should have to do .
i believe that is true for everybody on earth .
i think that if someone is lying , they &apos;re not purely  UNK  .
if you take a item that doesn &apos;t belong to a  UNK  , they &apos;re not just a  UNK  .
i think , even if you kill somebody , you &apos;re not a murderer , you &apos;re not a murderer .
and therefore , we have our dignity that have to be protected .
i also believe that in many parts of the country , and of course , also in many ways , in the adversarial world &apos;s .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i actually think that there &apos;s a lot of conflict in opposed to the poor .
and finally , i believe that the truth is , that the truth is , and it &apos;s very exciting , but we ultimately will ultimately be because we &apos;re going to make our ideal sense of intelligence , because of our ideal .
and you don &apos;t evaluate a society by treating them with rich people , who have power and  UNK  the privilege that they have taught me how to treat the poor people , have the poor people to me .
because it &apos;s the consequences that we have a deep implications of what we are .
occasionally , when i lost my balance , i &apos;ll end with this story .
sometimes i get too , and i tried .
i &apos;m really tired , it &apos;s like everybody .
these are some old ideas constantly think that appears very important in our minds .
and i did a lot of these kids who are sentenced to life .
i met from my children , that was 14 children , only 13 years old , and he was 14 years old .
i started thinking , how could this happen ?
why is a judge you can make a person ?
the judge is an adult man , but i see him still a child .
and there &apos;s a night , i &apos;m late at night , and i think maybe , if i should be able to get back to the judge of power .
well , the judge , the power of the judge .
so i &apos;d like to ask them a little bit .
and because i stayed late at night , without thinking , so i started writing a petition .
that i had a 14 years old , black people are poor black and poor .
i started working with this petition for a little bit as a petition for a little kids as a poor little black kid , like a white director , a director of white collar , a  UNK  . &quot;
i &apos;ve shown you that there was a petition for public affairs , and our  UNK  .
there &apos;s a really crazy thing about how this country does not have the right above all the wrong country .
the next day , i wake up and think about it , i have a proposal to write it ?
in my panic , not only do that , but i also sent it to the court .
a few months later , i seem to forget this .
and finally i decided i would go to the court , and i would take this difficult case .
i entered in the car , it was overwhelmed .
i got into the car , and then i went to court .
now i think it &apos;s going to be tough .
and finally i came out of the car , in the supreme court .
and as i walked up to the stairs for a black man , he was older than i did , he fundamentally does it .
when i saw this man , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; you are lawyers . he said , &quot; he said , &quot; are your skin ? &quot;
and he gets closer and closer and hugged me and hugged me .
well , i visited at myself .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m very proud of him . &quot;
and i have to tell you that it makes me so powerful .
it has a very profound effect on the personality that they split personalities , and i &apos;m making people contribution to the community , to think of great minds .
so i went to  UNK  .
and when i first step , i saw , i would come to the judge , i was to see .
he said , &quot; mr.  UNK  , have you had to write this  UNK  ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , sir . and we started to argue .
people started in the room because they were upset .
so i wrote these crazy things .
he &apos;s the director and they walked in the  UNK  .
before i arrive in  UNK  room and they  UNK  themselves .
and i don &apos;t stand in front of me , but i can still see the step back and forth .
he &apos;s always looking through the window , and he can hear everything screaming .
he went back to the time .
he walked into the room and i was very closely .
about 10 minutes after the judge of the statement .
on the  UNK  road , the police service was  UNK  because the  UNK  of the  UNK  .
he jumping up the team of the money on the camp .
and said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do ? &quot;
and the black men stand up and stand up and looked at the street and looked at me and said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; hey , let &apos;s say , &quot; your goal to justice because of his goal . &quot;
i come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral code is being understood that this life is very long .
knowing that we can &apos;t do people really care when we &apos;re interested in human rights and dignity .
that there is all of our attachment to the human eye .
that vision of all of our technology and design and entertainment and creativity has always got to be along with the lines of tracing and your community .
most of all of these things that i simply talk to you about your goals , or are to your target shape or on the end .
thank you very much .
so you &apos;ve heard the audience , and you &apos;ve been seeing the audience of the ted community to help him and do something to this .
instead of giving money , what can we do ?
well , there &apos;s always a lot of opportunities .
so for example , if you live in california , this spring is going to have a participatory design , there was a whole effort in a part of the world .
for example , we &apos;re going to spend a death sentence for dinner in five million years .
and 46 percent of the people who don &apos;t kill .
UNK  percent of the rape mines .
so , we have an opportunity to change this situation .
so going to be going to spread out the proposal to make sure that money to make sure the law of justice law .
and i think it &apos;s always the opportunity in us .
crime in the united states has declined fairly fast .
and part of the story is sometimes that &apos;s the creation of times .
what do you say to those who believe in this ?
in fact , the violence remained relatively  UNK  .
the rate of  UNK  in the united states is actually less violent than crime .
this is the fight against drugs .
and the number of  UNK  has been significant rise .
and we &apos;ve lost control over the downside of  UNK  things .
and so , we have three fighting wars for  UNK  or stolen goods or steal from the level to the level of wealth .
i believe we need to do more and more work to help the victims of a criminal being committed by the victim .
i think of our philosophy , which is nothing that helped us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
UNK  , he actually hit the bottom of the people here .
he was really a inspirational one .
thank you very much for coming to ted . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk about a little idea .
the shift of the mobility pathway of  UNK  .
and because that idea can be explained in a minute . i &apos;m going to tell you three stories before .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
he came over here in the years , as you know quite well .
and you think that he &apos;s going to get the tail , but not that .
he actually collected all kinds of fish .
he describe one of them is common . &quot;
this is such a butterfly specimens .
and a big career in the scale of this fish for decades .
now this is both red for the red list of red .
this story . we &apos;ve heard a lot of galapagos and but there &apos;s nowhere else .
but the point is , we &apos;re still here galapagos .
we still think it &apos;s  UNK  .
UNK  ads coming in . they &apos;re still not touching people .
so what happened here ?
the second story , is still a  UNK  for something called the mobility  UNK  of the curve .
i came back in &apos; 71 now , research in west africa .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to be later that later would be done in africa .
although i was able to fit in there with life there .
i got a deep tan that i &apos;ve been under deep tan .
this is my first  UNK  .
the trees are surrounded by plants , you can see a few trees .
there &apos;s also about 20 or so  UNK  , with a  UNK  called  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  nonprofit .
the washington state department of fish came to the lead to the fish and actually capture the actual number of ways that their incomes are increased .
27 years after i go back to the size of this fish .
they come to the age of adult size in scale .
there &apos;s an impact on the genome .
there &apos;s a lot of fish .
they &apos;re still very fine .
and these kind of fish seem to be comfortable .
so there &apos;s nothing changed .
my little third little story is that i &apos;m making of the people who were casting  UNK  out of nets for the boat in southeast asia .
in the 1970s -- no , no , no , no , starting with a lot of europe -- it &apos;s done a lot of projects .
growth is what the business means that those are  UNK  countries that have had gone to the 100,000 vessels that have gone to simply because the fishermen mend their nets .
and this boat here , it &apos;s bad , which is called  UNK  .
i used it to expand the across the highlands of the state of the sign of the sea as the sign of the ocean .
what we &apos;ve got out of meaning , we got it out to  UNK  it .
what we have now , right now , i know that this is the sea .
ninety percent of what we slap in a  UNK  fish , and other things that are under the sea .
and in fact , most of all kinds of little dots like  UNK  dots , or figments ,  UNK  , all of the coral reefs that live in coral reefs there .
the key thing is that this is to pull back up and forth .
these images are so realistic imagine this shift because this transition is happening over this rapid transition is happening .
in a year , you make a commercial fishing trip .
this is a  UNK   UNK  in this case , either turn from the soft corals of growth .
this is a sea turtle .
these kinds of things are not used , but they were thrown away because they died .
we had one time to live .
it &apos;s still not  UNK  .
so they want to kill it . it &apos;s a good taste .
this  UNK  is actually gather in the images because of the fishermen would move to the sea yet .
but it &apos;s not recognized with the document .
we transform the world that we don &apos;t remember this .
we tune in our main street level of a new level we don &apos;t remember before .
if you generalize something like this , something like this might look like this .
we have a couple of good words here , the number of biodiversity , the number of the number of blue whales , water supply .
over time , it will change -- it does something that changes by people do something or natural .
every generation is going to use images that they have their minds in the words of a standard that would come over and over , and that over again .
the difference is that they were perceived as a loss .
but they didn &apos;t realize it was such a thing as a loss .
you can do a series of feedback after change .
you want to keep the things that you want to either .
and that &apos;s much bigger , much bigger , what we want to do today .
we want to keep things like , but there &apos;s no more like more  UNK  .
people should think that this issue is affecting everyone in the society , but when it &apos;s &quot; predators , killing them , &quot; and they don &apos;t know what they did .
because obviously , a species of course , a number of animals , before it became extinct .
so you don &apos;t lose animals with the population .
you &apos;re just losing animals .
so they &apos;re not considered an amputation as a loss .
over time , we focus on big animals in the ocean , we focus on big fish .
they become scarce , because they are bycatch .
over time , we &apos;re just very little , and we think this is sugar .
the question was asked , what about people ?
it &apos;s because they didn &apos;t know it .
in fact , a lot of people , and scientists would argue that it &apos;s actually a lot of different .
they &apos;re going to fight for the evidence that  UNK  showed earlier than that they didn &apos;t go before .
for instance , the story that some people who have seen somewhere in a whole raft of a whole variety of fish in the area that can &apos;t be used because of science as well as a scientist , because it isn &apos;t scientific evidence that scientific , because it isn &apos;t atrophied .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know even if they &apos;re living in society , because they &apos;re living in society , because they didn &apos;t exist .
and so , as large as important as the ocean can be protected .
for some of the ocean protected areas like that we &apos;re actually re-engineering back to the past .
we &apos;re going to reconstruct the people that cannot be aware of the shift in the way , was at the very low level .
it &apos;s for those who can see the protected areas of the ocean and people can benefit from deep insights that make it deep into their  UNK  .
so what about people who couldn &apos;t do that ? because they don &apos;t have access to the people in their hand ?
i think of the arts and maybe we can cover , and simulate a simulation .
this is the kind of  UNK  bay .
it &apos;s been a long time ago in the last 500 years .
you &apos;ll notice the sound of colors and sounds like &quot; avatar . &quot;
by the end of the movie &quot;  UNK  &quot; if you think about how it was so deeply moved -- what &apos;s remarkable story about -- why it &apos;s so deeply  UNK  -- why they are so deeply  UNK  by the symbol of the  UNK  .
because it &apos;s trigger something that sense of represents the feeling of being lost .
and so my suggestion is , this is what i &apos;m the only thing i want to do for two bits and pieces of water . &quot;
thank you very much .
do you know how much of your choice ?
do you know how many of you make a choice ?
recently , i &apos;ve been investigated more than 2,000 americans , and the average american number of options than the average american .
there was a ceos with the ceos that we &apos;ve been ceos with these ceos .
and scientists have been putting out all of these different missions that those ceos and they &apos;ve become engaged in those moments that make decisions too much time to do it for those tasks too .
and they found out that the average ceos are doing about  UNK  for a week .
of course , each of these missions are so many small options .
fifty percent of our decisions in the ceos of their ceos .
and only about 12 percent of the decisions that are made in one or more .
now , think about your own choice of your own choice .
do you have the idea of choice in about nine minutes compared to an hour ?
do you think where do you go to the management of those options ?
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest problems of our choice is the overwhelming problem .
i want to talk about the issues and how it works .
and when i &apos;m talking about it , i &apos;ll have some questions for you and i hope you &apos;ll answer from your answers .
so when i ask you a question , i don &apos;t see what if you want to burn an weight , you just raise your hand .
otherwise , when i ask , and if you ask , and if you &apos;re happy .
now the first question of today is , are you ready to hear about the issue in the city ?
thank you .
when i graduate students from stanford to college , i had a lot of progressive grocery stores , which i got to do , and i was actually quite rich .
this is called &quot;  UNK  &apos;s called  UNK  .
now , it &apos;s kind of entertainment .
they &apos;ve got 250 different kinds of mustard and over 500 vegetables -- fruits and vegetables are much better and vegetables , and we do it , and we get working on water , and we actually get working on water .
i used to be very fond of doing these shops , but i &apos;ve been asking myself , how do you not ?
this is the shelves .
they have more 75 milliseconds of their oil , including the locked in prison , but they locked themselves into a hundred  UNK  .
so , on one day , i decided to leave management , and i asked people , &quot; what are people actually effective ? &quot;
and he &apos;s just traveling and gathering over the course of every day , often come back to the camera , often comes back up with cameras .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we took the jam jars for the lab .
this is the  UNK  jars of their  UNK  .
they have more  UNK  jam jars .
we opened a very small shop for a day in the shop .
we  UNK  jars spent six different types of nose and jam jars , and we realized that , and we noticed something : second , in the case , and we would like to throw some other jars ?
many people used to stop , around 60 percent of us , when we gave the  UNK  jars , and only if you have 40 percent .
the next thing we realized in the case , we would like to buy one bottles .
now we see the opposite effect .
one of the people who used to stop the same type , three percent of them buy one of the bottles .
the other one of the  UNK  jam jars , as we surprise , and we saw 30 percent of the  UNK  bottle .
now , let &apos;s try to do a problem at least six times as i would want to buy a bottle of wine .
now you don &apos;t choose to buy the  UNK  for bottles , so we would have gotten any better for example , because we have shown that problems in the overwhelming decision making matters .
we choose not to select that even when it goes backwards , but it &apos;s good for us .
today , the subject will continue to saving money today .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you a lesson with  UNK  , which involve  UNK  , where we look at  UNK  , where we look at  UNK  for a million people in the united states are still from the u.s. plan for a u.s. plan .
and what we see is that the amount of available resources in a 401 plan to have a lasting impact on saving your ability to save tomorrow better saving for tomorrow .
and what we discovered is that there in a correlation .
so in these plans , we had been  UNK  plan for a long trial that were volunteer from where everybody &apos;s from his  UNK  at the point .
and we found that the more resources were actually given to the greater ratio , it &apos;s actually less .
so if you look more closely at these plans for the funding for those two billion dollars in the middle of the mid- &apos; 70s , but we &apos;re still not as far as we want to be in the middle .
in the funding given the life-saving antiretroviral treatment available to about 60 percent of those sources .
now , it shows you that even have more options when you choose to have a lot more profound consequences , there are negative consequences .
for those of you who have been more options for more and more participating in making participation .
the more the more select people who send their money into the account of the financial markets .
now it &apos;s not the choice that we choose to choose those options that anyone who tells us when you look at the viable future .
over the past decade we &apos;ve seen three negative consequences when it has three negative consequences for everyone .
they tend to postpone postpone postpone postpone postpone postpone postpone postpone warming .
they seem to make some worse decisions in our health , in the medical care .
they seem to choose something that they do less .
the main reason is because we can look at what we can look at the big wall of the mustard -- but we don &apos;t look at the image , and we don &apos;t even see the image of the  UNK  and even some of the surprising and even .
so what i want to propose you today is a technical standpoint that we inspected centers that we &apos;ve tested by many ways that you might be easy business in your business .
first : cuts
you &apos;ve heard that before , but it &apos;s not compared to the right now less than .
people always get confused when i said , &quot;
they &apos;re always going to worry about their place .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing here is if you &apos;re ready to reduce the amount of choice to decrease the amount of sales , and that &apos;s the quality of the experience of the practice of choice , and that &apos;s the experience of outcomes .
when gamble &amp; amp ; gamble on  UNK  , on &amp; amp ; co ; they get 15 percent of their sales increased  UNK  rates .
when the golden gate you get rid of the worst product for them in a cat , they get a  UNK  increase in like , a  UNK  rate of generating profit and cutting the overhead .
you know , on average grocery store nowadays , you offer your product to you today .
now , walmart gives me 100,000 products .
but the retailers of the ninth standard store in the world &apos;s nine days in the world , and it turns out to the mere  UNK  of a  UNK  product .
now in the world of finance , i think one of the best examples of how to make the best choice is david to do with david  UNK   UNK   UNK  , at harvard with dr. david  UNK   UNK  at harvard .
so everybody was in the  UNK  in an automatic payload .
for those of you who want to choose the next 20 or 300 dollars .
people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut them . &quot;
it &apos;s all important choice .
and the first thing i did was to do is to say , &quot; i know how different choice .
and if you can &apos;t measure the success of the consumers are then .
so when we start the part of this afternoon with my talk to you today .
and gary slutkin : we &apos;re ready to help people in this session -- it costs me to think free money .
this is the description of human description .
and i think you should read it .
now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read it . if you want to give you a nice request .
it &apos;s good for you . gary  UNK  .
reading the text ?
now i &apos;m going to show you more .
you know , this is a con , not the con .
now , who &apos;s ready for this ?
i think i &apos;m going to hear more clapping .
okay .
in fact , you have a lot of information about the first time , but then i guess what i &apos;m going to try and get it in real second time .
because the reality is making it more realistic .
the second thing that gives me the second problem of getting overwhelming problems that the point of  UNK  .
that people are understanding the generational difference whether they have to choose between the ability to understand the wider array of choices and those outcomes that matter , clearly .
why do people use average to 15 percent when they go to the atm , take their credit for cash credit cards ?
because it doesn &apos;t look like the money .
and that &apos;s just making it clear that it &apos;s becoming clear as a more effective tool to help people save more people saving lives .
so the lesson i did with  UNK  and  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  and people in work together at  UNK  and the people who have now been working on a 401 plan for a 401 plan .
and during this stage we &apos;ve been keeping a little bit of earlier this .
what we asked us to do is that we asked people to do what &apos;s positive about going to happen in the future if they save their future .
by simply doing that  UNK  the amount of moisture that goes up to 20 percent and more people save their money or they save up to 40 percent .
the third is categorize it : classification
we can solve a lot more classification than we solve the options of options .
for example , this is one of our shelves emptying .
it turns out that the grocery stores and underneath the  UNK  in the row and in the new magazine .
but what do you know ?
if i just showed you up to 600 summaries of the magazine , and i did it for 10 different than when you break it down into the magazine , and i believe you &apos;ve given me that i believe that if you gave me a better option for me if you just gave me more than i gave you just 600 .
because the divide for me to know how they divide .
now these are two different kinds of different disciplines .
one thing called &quot; the jazz &quot; the other &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
if you think the left on the left is the right side of the right hand , you &apos;re clapping .
well , there are some people .
and if you think the left on the right hand , the right side of you .
all right , a little bit better .
now , it &apos;s not true .
on the left hand , and on the right , but you know what you don &apos;t know .
this is a  UNK  arrangement .
the divide up to what we need to do with the people who have chosen not to make choices .
and you see that the problem is that it goes down to the list of all of the financial resources .
who were looking for expect information ?
the fourth technology : my four conditions for complex conditions .
it shows us that we can actually solve much more information than we could do it , we can do a better way .
we &apos;ve got to go there .
i &apos;m going to give you an example of what i &apos;m talking about .
think about it comes to a tough choice : bought a car .
this is a german truck that you have the chance of your own car , which you want to mean yourself .
you &apos;ve got over 60 different decisions , to finish the door for your car .
and those options would make the changes that they make decisions .
the car , the color outside i knew there were  UNK  , i did 56 choice .
grasslands .
so what i &apos;m going to do is going to change that decision making those decisions that exist .
so half of the clients go out of the  UNK  , the car  UNK  , four drivers of choice .
there &apos;s another one more  UNK  , from the  UNK  , four options , which is later on the motivation , the  UNK  car .
what do i want to say ?
you &apos;re really busy .
so if you click &quot; on the top of the button , &quot; which means you &apos;re being too much choice , that means too much .
what you &apos;re looking for is that people from the lower choice , and it &apos;s getting more likely to get the top of it again .
we are losing them .
they go from the top of the ladder , they &apos;re stuck there .
with  UNK  information , the same number of options .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is that i &apos;ve done that i &apos;ve shown in that expression .
if i started with you , i started to make a choice .
and even the engine wouldn &apos;t talk to any one of the things that i &apos;m interested in how it &apos;s going to help me know how to make it .
it also gives me a tremendous excitement of these incredible products that i &apos;m associated with it , and i &apos;m so excited that i &apos;m busy and busy to motivate me to be busy .
let me summarize .
i talked about four technical issues to deal with the overwhelming chaos of the transportation option -- but it &apos;s limited to the capacity to maximize electrical charge .
everything that i &apos;m going to show you today is designed to help you make your choice better and you can apply yourself to your own body , and you can also serve yourself as well as best to serve yourself .
because i believe that the key to choose the best choice is to choose your carefully one choice .
and we have the more thorough physical practice in practice , we can make better choices in practice .
thank you very much .
i think we have to do something about a tradition in medicine . &quot;
and i think this starts with a doctor , it &apos;s me .
and maybe i had surgery for a moment to remove a little credit for that .
before i really started to get the importance of speakers , let &apos;s start making baseball or playing baseball .
oh , why not ?
we &apos;re going to get there , we &apos;re going to get into the world cup .
who doesn &apos;t love the baseball , right ?
the baseball is riddled with statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
the book is called &quot;  UNK  , and it basically said about data , and it used statistics to build a baseball team .
i &apos;m going to focus on a number that i hope you &apos;ve heard .
that &apos;s the  UNK  .
for example , 300 of them , a  UNK  player .
so that &apos;s 10 times the baseball player , and it was safe .
that &apos;s the football field in the field , it falls down , and it wouldn &apos;t be taken , and you want to try and get it back to the top of it .
there are 10 times .
do you know a  UNK  player in the 300 occupants of the big championships of what ?
very good , super  UNK  .
what do you know that people might call an index of player ?
by the way , it was a  UNK  player ; it was safe .
legendary ocean -- there &apos;s a great ted williams called the players -- the last big bang on the end of the day .
so , let &apos;s take this story into the world &apos;s most pleasant part of the world , which is probably a little bit more uncomfortable for what i &apos;m going to show you here .
suppose you &apos;re  UNK  your doctor and you take a surgeon with  UNK  .
well , it &apos;s okay , right ?
well , suppose you live in a remote somewhere and you have a  UNK  , and you have a  UNK  therapist , and then a therapist tries to a  UNK  failure .
but , you know , do you know ?
she got this year on the hand . there &apos;s a lot of work .
and put the  UNK  index .
it &apos;s clear that &apos;s not yet .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
well , you think the  UNK  of a surgeon , a cardiac surgeon , a nurse or an orthopedic surgeon , a  UNK  surgeon ?
1000 awesome .
but in fact , nobody knows in the medical doctor or a surgeon needs to be a good physician .
we do this is what they do , even in the world with snakes , perfect .
no , absolute being made no mistakes , but he worried about how little details will make no more detail .
and that &apos;s the message when i &apos;m totally embarrassed .
i &apos;m an obsession with perfection .
at the high school , you also say that the grade classes are also very simple .
and so i got perfect .
i learned in my little  UNK  little village in the hospital in the ward , no  UNK  .
and i  UNK  everything .
i learned in the surgery and started to have the height of the former self , used to have a very rare complex diseases , which are rare and complex diseases .
i know the ways that diagnosis of  UNK  when he increased by  UNK  .
and during the process , i collected more and more knowledge .
well , i graduated , i graduated from ucla ,  UNK  .
and i graduated from high school with is that if i remember , and i know , the more or the better , the more i know , the better i &apos;ll make mistakes .
and that seems to be true for me when i met her  UNK  .
i was at a  UNK  hospital in a school day in toronto , when she got three  UNK  in the hospital emergency room .
i was at that time , i was locked in the door .
and my mission when i came to ask the emergency room , i was to see the emergency room .
and the report to the physician .
and i met her , she was very , very her father was an sob , she was breathing .
and when i hear her poetry , she didn &apos;t hear utter  UNK  .
and when i listen to my grandmother , listening to the stethoscope on both sides of the  UNK  of the  UNK  showing by showing signs of  UNK  by heart failure .
this condition is not going to work , and instead of  UNK  , and instead of giving a little bit of blood into the lungs , and then blood and then breathe , so this is an trouble breathing , breathing .
this is not a diagnosis .
i started to try and treat her .
i gave her a  UNK  . i tell the drug work to reduce the heart .
i put a drug in  UNK  to why it is open defecation .
and within a half hours , two and a half hours later , she began to comfort .
and i also felt good .
and that was when i made the first mistake ; i made three mistakes .
in fact , i make two mistakes .
i &apos;m giving three  UNK  without a blanket monitoring .
i don &apos;t mention the phone and i &apos;m supposed to do what i &apos;m supposed to be to do , to be the chance to meet the patient .
and you know , you can get more information about three .
maybe i have the right thing .
maybe i don &apos;t want to do an intern .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and responsible for the patients taking care of the patient who &apos;s own doctors , but also not to be the physician .
my second mistake was two .
when i ignore the  UNK  , ignore which i remember to ignore the  UNK  in my mind , &quot; i don &apos;t have to work or an opinion . &quot;
in fact , i was low , i was so confident that she was taking care of her , &quot; she thought she was okay ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking and said , &quot; oh , i &apos;m thinking , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to think . &quot;
i remember the last saw yesterday .
so i went through the papers , and i took the physician , and i brought her home .
and i went back to the clinic .
the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had a feeling  UNK  in the gut feeling .
but i kept working on .
and then i clean up , i cleaned up and walked up to the car back to the car in the back home and i did not work .
i went through the emergency room on the road .
and there was another nurse , a nurse , not taking care of three nurses , which is another one of the nurses , told me three doctors , which were the emergency doctor , i know was an emergency doctor .
who makes the three more awesome inspire three and medicine , but the emergency medical emergency room because we met the patient .
three ?
&quot; can you remember the patient ? &quot;
we mean that &apos;s quite simple .
&quot; oh , she goes back , &quot; and she &apos;s like that .
okay . she &apos;s got to go back .
she comes back and intimate death .
they &apos;re an hour after three hours of home , after she left her home , and she calls her family and she calls back to three emergency room and she comes back to the hospital emergency room .
and she wasn &apos;t nearly as she said  UNK  .
and the new emergency room .
they gave her blood pressure .
they put three base .
and i was shocked .
and i would like sitting on a train , because after three states , she got three states out of intensive care , and i should deliver three or  UNK  .
and in two or three days later , every single day , it &apos;s never again .
now she has been  UNK  changes .
and gathering together .
and within the next eight or nine days , they give up .
and after about nine days , they spend three days -- she  UNK  , the wife of  UNK  , mothers and .
they never said to forget mahmoud .
and that &apos;s where i knew i was there .
in the next few weeks , i was even suffering from my experience shame and i said that in our culture -- in our culture , i &apos;m lonely , but i felt isolated as a person , because i can &apos;t tell you , because i can &apos;t tell my colleagues .
you know the kind of embarrassed , when you &apos;re a secret to yourself , you can &apos;t force them and you never get yourself , and then you have yourself and the end of the  UNK  , and you tend to have a horrible misunderstanding .
and you do a lot of damage to their knees .
this is a shame .
the embarrassed that doesn &apos;t get to talk about the kind of  UNK  in your liquid .
that &apos;s not the bad thing , it &apos;s not bad , but he &apos;s bad guys .
and that &apos;s what i feel .
and it &apos;s not because my doctor ; he &apos;s easy ; he &apos;s incredibly vulnerable .
he talked to the patients , and i &apos;m sure that you &apos;re a whole new service , and i &apos;m sure that they &apos;re not sued .
and i kept asking myself .
why did i not ask the doctor for the patient ?
and in the most frightening thing : why do people make a mistake ?
why do i mean ?
it &apos;s a little bit of touch .
i began to see a little bit more .
and one day in a few days , there &apos;s a lot of holes in the form of holes , and i &apos;m sure it &apos;s quite a bit more time .
and i from  UNK  myself , what am i going to try and make a perfect mistake , or not to crack the conscience of change .
and that &apos;s an hour .
and i went back to work .
and that happens .
two years after my doctor was officially in a hospital in an emergency doctor in toronto , and i went in toronto .
so it &apos;s very busy , i &apos;m asking myself .
he just kept on it .
i watched his wind pipe , it was a little bit  UNK  .
and i  UNK   UNK  a vanilla .
and even if he &apos;s walking out of his walk out of the smoke .
and two days later i came to the next two , and that &apos;s my friend of mine to my talk to me in three rooms .
and she said this : do you remember ?
&quot; can you remember the patient ? &quot;
it turns out , he &apos;s not often  UNK  .
he &apos;s got a life-threatening illness might be a threat .
you can pay the google diseases , but it &apos;s so infected , it wouldn &apos;t include it , so it &apos;s  UNK  , and it &apos;s  UNK  , and it &apos;s  UNK  .
and luckily he didn &apos;t die .
he had to put antibiotics and after a few days .
and i ended up having spent time with  UNK  myself , then i feel guilty , and i got back to that again , again .
two of the  UNK  shift in an emergency room , i don &apos;t have  UNK  .
now , the mistake i &apos;m not easy to do is that when you &apos;re at the hospital in the same way .
in both cases , i don &apos;t have the  UNK  , and i don &apos;t think nothing else .
there &apos;s a patient who i think of the mycelium .
so i asked the x-ray of the spirit . my colleagues that were working on the side of her colleagues that were actually undermining the surgeon .
the other patients were now .
i ask the water to get the water to the back and ask him for his colleagues .
and i was working on the colleagues , and he actually had to detect the cancer , he had to be called the surgeon .
in both cases , the surgeon &apos;s okay .
but every time , they all  UNK  , and i just looked at it .
and i want to tell you that the worst mistake of my worst fears that were the first five years of my colleagues that is all rubbish .
some of my mistakes that took place in five years .
christians ,  UNK  , no support .
so the problem is : if i couldn &apos;t tell you about my mistake , if i lost my fear memory without a fear for the idea of what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
how do i teach them is what i did to do ?
if i go into a room -- like this -- i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to be thinking about .
at the end of the time you hear about someone mistake , then false ?
well , you go to a dinner party and you may have heard a little bit of a  UNK  , but you &apos;ll never hear somebody mistake .
if i had to go to a room full of my colleagues , and i remember the help and start to tell you what i &apos;ve just told you , maybe i &apos;m not going to tell you two before they were going to get bored , they were going to get better off , and they were going to go on .
and in fact , if i knew my colleagues and i knew that a colleagues were also frustrated by the service of my colleagues , i believe in the hospital , i believe in the hospital , i believe in , in the other end , i &apos;m going to look at the other end of it .
that &apos;s the system we have .
it &apos;s a complete failure .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two places -- and wrong people who make mistakes , but doctors don &apos;t go without sleep , and without having a failure , and the end of the result , and the end of the results .
and it &apos;s almost like a reflective tape in my own , as antibodies can grab that person .
and we &apos;ve got this idea that , if we &apos;ve got rid of the other people , it &apos;s basically a safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
in the &apos; 20 years of writing and do the medical research for medicine , i &apos;ve been researching and every single one of the first thing that can possibly be one of my first  UNK  &quot; art . &quot;
and what i learned is that error is actually everywhere .
we work in a system that &apos;s happening right there for every day , in 10 or so there &apos;s an unlimited number of infections , or hospital-acquired infections .
in this country , i  UNK  who died because of canadian medical mistakes .
in the united states , up the pill to some that occurred to some up the edge of it .
in both cases , these are  UNK  , but in fact , because the reality is that we &apos;ve never done before .
and the problem is .
in a school system where the hospital does every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with .
the lack of sleep deprivation .
we can &apos;t get rid of this problem .
we have the stereotypes based on this past , so for example , i can admit that patients has severe disease .
now at the same time , he suppose , let &apos;s say he  UNK  and said the breath and out of your nose , and suddenly the breath of a  UNK  , and suddenly causing a severe loss of negative impact .
i don &apos;t apply one more disease .
i don &apos;t know it robots ; i don &apos;t mean a procedure .
and my patient &apos;s not at me -- it &apos;s not every time ; they &apos;re all familiar with the same way .
but for that , it &apos;s wrong .
so , if you include the system , like i was taught to get rid of all the employees , and there will be no one mistake .
and do you know what people don &apos;t want to talk about their worst case ?
on my  UNK  shows , &quot; virtual &quot;  UNK  , to art , &quot; i &apos;ve created a habit , &quot; which is the worst mistake i &apos;ll tell you , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell everybody from the medical workers , &quot; and i &apos;m going to talk to everybody , &quot; oh my gosh , i can go , what do you &apos;re going to do about any of them ? &quot;
and the irregular verbs , they would go out in  UNK  , and then they looked down to the swallowed , and then swallowed them up .
they want to tell their story . they want to share their story .
they want to be said , &quot; hey , don &apos;t go to the door . &quot;
what they need is an environmental condition for them .
what they need is a medical culture that needs .
and this starts with a own physicians .
people , according to the physicians , this is the human flesh , and as a human flesh , as a human being , is not something proud of it , to try to figure out something that &apos;s wrong .
sharing experiences with others .
it &apos;s supporting someone else &apos;s talk about them .
and just the mistake of someone else &apos;s not kind of  UNK  , &quot; gotcha gotcha to pick up a way to  UNK  , so that everybody could be better .
and the only work in medical culture that control systems are controlled by humans , and as humans control systems , they will make mistakes .
so the system was making moved forward to make a plan to make a mistake , not that people can &apos;t make any money , and also make a  UNK  , by any way to track where anybody can monitor the health care system can be health care system , but it can be made mistakes , and when we &apos;re just being made the same thing that we &apos;re made a mistake that we can make it , because we &apos;ve made of  UNK  , so that we can make it .
my name is brian .
i &apos;m a new requirement .
i &apos;m a product .
i &apos;m incredibly sorry about that , but i try to learn something that i can transmit to someone else .
i still don &apos;t know what i think about , but i can get it .
and i &apos;d like to finish with my grandmother : i remember .
hi everyone . i &apos;m a kevin  UNK  &apos;s  UNK  . i &apos;m a  UNK  , and i watched youtube videos on youtube .
this is real .
today we &apos;re going to spend some time talking about how video became a little bit of how a quick video is why this is .
we all want to be the celebrity , mistaking for young actors , and when i was young actors , it seems very difficult to do it .
but now , video games on the web has been done to anybody in any way we can make or wherever we can make products in a region .
any of you can all be famous on the internet .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
and among them , there &apos;s only one that has become tiny , and it &apos;s got a lot of cultural and becoming a culture .
so how does this happen ?
there are three reasons : the people who come up with communities and unexpected participation .
we go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
UNK  !
UNK  !
last year , it was already posting the video outside the house of the yosemite national park in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , video had 23 million views .
this is the chart that shows the first time that this video became very popular in advance .
but the idea is not creating a video .
he wanted it to be a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what you do when you make a yosemite long yosemite long country .
he actually has been a lot of nature .
while this video was being posted on a month .
so what happened here ?
he &apos;s actually a jimmy  UNK  .
jimmy  UNK  ended up on twitter puts it on twitter to eventually make this ubiquitous video as being quite popular now .
because the people who have created a kind of as a jimmy  UNK  and gave us the interesting things and just as a bigger audience .
friday brings , the friday brings down to the street six people on weekends , people are looking forward to the weekend . you don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to fall down on friday street , i won &apos;t talk about this video , hopefully , i &apos;m not supposed to be .
&quot;  UNK  &apos; fairy tale that &apos;s one of the most popular video in this year .
for almost 200 million views .
this is a chart .
and like  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  .
so what &apos;s happening today ?
well , it &apos;s a second day , right .
and if you &apos;re wondering about what you &apos;re going to be about six days .
what about this day ? this sixth through this friday ?
well ,  UNK  .  UNK  , and it &apos;s a diary page that online writing is about it .
michael nelson mandela from the science theater is one of the first people who are living on twitter in social media offers a social network .
but it &apos;s important to be a group of individuals who make a meme or they have an idea that they have a whole lot more common practice .
and so then this community came out of the people who know this story and they start to tell us about it .
as a result is more than 10,000 dollars on youtube .
even in the first seven days , every day it has a video  UNK  uploaded .
it &apos;s not like a  UNK  of the 20th century , this is how we become part of a new phenomenon or something to do with it .
&quot;  UNK  is an animation &quot; is an animation that would repeat itself .
it looks like this .
this video has close to 50 million views .
and if you think it &apos;s odd , you should know that there &apos;s a version of three hours .
even the cat is also watching this video .
but the cat is watching the other cats .
but what &apos;s important here is the creative thing that it is creative in the cultural ghetto .
you have  UNK  .
someone has created an old version .
and then it has eight international level .
a community  UNK  speaks to make a little bit of a fool , which we can all be part of that .
because now we don &apos;t just enjoy it .
and who can predict anything about this ?
anyone can double  UNK  . &quot; rebecca saxe  UNK  or  UNK  . &quot;
can you write a script for there ?
in one of the world , there are more days longer than two minutes , only really striking things about it , but it &apos;s a surprising way that it may be able to do this .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this fantastic session who was supposed to be about one of the people who are outside bicycle in new york city , i would not be interested in new york city .
so my video is not getting out of the bike doesn &apos;t work on the bike lanes , but often there are things that make you don &apos;t get your bike lane .
it was absolutely astonishing and humor , casey martin villeneuve &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; watch .
and so this approach is very good to any new way that we do it in a creative way .
and so it gives us a big question .
what is the video : what does that mean ?
UNK  .
what does this mean ?
but the people who make a whole community , but the whole thing is totally creative , but now is a new form of traditional culture and anyone can access to the audience and decide who gets accessible to the decision .
i mean , as i mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world , the major favorite ones , justin bieber , starting from youtube .
no one has to allow your ideas .
and we all feel that some of our pop culture in my own pop culture .
and these things aren &apos;t supposed to be the characteristics of traditional media , which is probably not nearly as much of media , but the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about not .
now i work in the industry .
and i remember my new initiative is now trying to go into the environment -- i &apos;m trying to notice ...
... from my contribution from the community .
this is a quick video shows what we &apos;re doing .
they wait .
maybe a minute to play for a minute .
we &apos;re going to -- we can ignore -- i &apos;m going to leave the video -- so ...
no .
this is not ...
okay .
the technology is ...
oh , i finish my argument ?
okay . thank you very much .
my story starts right here in here , in rajasthan , about two years ago .
at the time i was in the desert , under the same sufi poet ali ,  UNK  ali .
we &apos;re having a conversation with nothing changes from ancient indian ancient indian .
so , when people we would like to go to a horse and we would go into a room and across the room .
today , we do the same with the airplane .
at that time ,  UNK   UNK  , from  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  , and you &apos;re not going to spray .
today , we can do that with mechanical drawing board and machines .
the conclusion is that the magic trick is replaced by machine .
and this makes me sad .
i found myself a lot of technology .
i &apos;m afraid that i &apos;m going to lose the dusk and enjoy dusk , but not the camera that i didn &apos;t get onto twitter .
and it seems to be the right thing that makes the magic , not kill it .
when i was a little girl , i got my little pocket map by my pocket .
and this is a piece of technology that became the magic for me .
it becomes the  UNK  of the gold mine opened up to the world and the ships .
so i felt like our mobile phones , our phones , our  UNK  and our cameras .
they really prevented the creative inspiration .
and so i jumped into the dance , in this technology , to look at this technology , let &apos;s see how it does not kill .
i &apos;ve shown a book that i was about 16 years old .
and so when i see the ipad , i see it &apos;s a  UNK  narrative around the world .
it &apos;s knowing how it is .
it knows where we are .
it &apos;s a picture , it &apos;s an illustration , and the touch .
the narrative is becoming increasingly .
but what are we doing with it ?
so i &apos;m actually going to launch , an app and an interactive software application .
so here , &quot; please put your hand on your hand , &quot; come up , &quot; come up . &quot;
and so -- it said , &quot; well , this book is ... &quot; and &quot; so i went on .
and in fact , i make a character in my book .
in a few moments , a little beautiful thing -- and i &apos;m going down on the ipad -- and you know , where the gps dot is sent to the address .
so i &apos;m very excited by these possibilities like this .
now , i talked a lot about magic .
and i mean , it &apos;s not the  UNK  ; i mean the magic , these kids have incubation periods .
and the brainstorms , don &apos;t in the glass , which is always very interesting to me .
and so here you go , you ready to take the ipad to get out .
and they &apos;re going to give you the rest of your book .
another idea of  UNK  came to me was a whole galaxy that could be a single galaxy .
and so here , every book in the world has become a little new world that i pull in this piece of equipment in a different device .
and a map of open .
now , it &apos;s always a book , which is also a map of these maps .
this is a map of a  UNK  map out of the flash , and it gives you the rest of your books .
at certain point in the book , it will show you the secrets in it .
so i &apos;m going to go now .
one really important thing to me is to do is to create the content of modern india .
here , this is the sunny ones .
we &apos;ve all heard about these little mermaid , we all heard of these patron goddesses are not in india , but there &apos;s not a  UNK  version of india ?
these heavy  UNK  are trapped in jars for thousands of years in a thousand years of a thousand years old .
and so we bring them back to the children &apos;s book .
and a story reflects an environmental problem .
by the way , the way , i think a big problem in the last 10 years is that they were  UNK  in the room , they were  UNK  .
these technologies , mobile devices , we can bring them out in the natural world , by technology .
one of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re just going to take on a journey , you have to go out and take the camera on the nature of the physical objects .
when i remember , i &apos;ve got a collection of  UNK  , the mycelium .
and that &apos;s why , kids don &apos;t today .
so , in this  UNK  get back from this ceremony , you have to take a picture of a  UNK  , a picture of a book called it .
in another chapter , you have to take a photograph of a  UNK  , and you name it .
and what happened is you &apos;re going to create a digital photography that you can post your online .
a baby in london &apos;s high school , and he said , &quot; today , i see you today . &quot;
a baby is saying , &quot; today , &quot; i see the monkey . &quot;
and that creates a kind of social networks around the digital  UNK  that you take shot .
within the connection , the color of the world , and technology is also very different possibilities .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to have an interaction with the ipad that you take on the technology and augmented reality , you see that this is an augmented reality outside your home .
at one point , your screen is here .
and so you have to create an hour and we read the text and read the book .
we &apos;re moving towards all , we &apos;re moving towards the world where nature is coming closer to the technology and magic , and that technology will come together .
we &apos;re trying to solar power .
we &apos;re going to be our kids , and we &apos;re close to the natural world , love and the magic that we have kids in love .
thank you .
because i usually try to explain to people who understand new technologies are coming out of new technologies , and i think , because i &apos;m going to be here , because i &apos;m afraid of today , i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m going to try to look at what &apos;s happening in the same time , and it seems to be amazing .
i &apos;m going to start with a white lab .
so , if you can make this report .
this is just a random page paper that i pick out of my material from my papers .
what i want to show people is not the details of the details of the details of it .
this is a page of paper that you &apos;re analyzing the strength of the suffering from the power of a local control .
and what &apos;s interesting about this page is , like a lot of other technologies that are familiar with us , which is a  UNK  line of a  UNK  curve , a very familiar path .
in other words , each one represents a level for a month .
and this is a new thing that we talk about the bell curve .
there &apos;s something weird here .
and that &apos;s basically what i want to say .
now , if you can go to higher .
if you can go to a little bit higher , because i &apos;m using a piece of paper .
why do we have to draw the curve from  UNK  ?
the answer is , if i &apos;m talking about a normal curve , this is a pretty typical year , and this is a kind of time , and this is what i &apos;m trying to do , i &apos;m trying to think about .
they seem to move like this .
and they don &apos;t tell us .
now if i talk about graph , for example , technology is possible , that technology is a curve , in a very similar  UNK  curve , looks like a straight line .
but when this happens , things that &apos;s changed .
so , if you look like shipping as fast as a technology , i could someday and deliver for a 30 seconds .
it &apos;s not like that .
and without any precedent in the history of technology in the pace of technological change pace .
now the question i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at some of these laws are not shining .
things can &apos;t fix them as quickly as they are happening .
one of the two things will happen .
or it &apos;s going to turn into a kind of a curve , until something that &apos;s completely different from something that &apos;s going to happen .
it &apos;s all possible .
right now , i &apos;m optimistic , so i think it can be in this way .
if that &apos;s true , it means that we &apos;re in the middle of the transfer of attention .
we &apos;re in the middle of this line in the state of the world where i am .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask is , what i &apos;m asking myself , is the new state of the world where is there ?
what is the new state in the world ?
because this transition was kind of hard to guess where we &apos;re in the middle of the process .
when i was a child growing up towards the future , for almost 2,000 years , and what people would normally happen in 2000 .
this is a conference where everybody &apos;s home is about the future , and everyone can see that the future 2,000 years around the future .
it is , while we &apos;re moving towards it .
so , in other words , the future of a year , the one of the whole lives of everybody .
i think the reason for that is because we all feel about what &apos;s happening at that point .
the transformation is happening . we can feel it .
and we know that it doesn &apos;t make sense to think about 30 , 50 years later life , all the hell would look very different from what we &apos;re going to do today is simplistic , not what we &apos;re going to do .
so what i &apos;d like to talk about is , is perhaps the body , is that we &apos;re experiencing .
to do that , i &apos;m going to talk about something that actually has nothing to do with computers and technology .
because i think the only way to understand this is to understand that really is to put yourself in a long view .
the balance that i want to look at the balance of life on earth .
and so , i think this picture of what it means if people look at it , if people look at it at it .
if you go back to a two and a half billion years , the earth would kind of rocky iv but lots of chemicals around it .
and if people look at how chemical stack , then we &apos;ll understand how they begin to understand how they begin .
and i think there are  UNK   UNK   UNK  , how it starts to explain to the rna , but i &apos;ll tell you about it , that tells the story of the  UNK  , which is where it &apos;s all around the sun .
and some of the oil droplet that combines the properties between the chemical elements of the part of the chemical that make the chemical identity and join the oil droplet .
and the oil droplet to start with the teeth .
and they &apos;re the model of the most elemental forces , the oil droplet bodies .
but these days that actually don &apos;t exist , as we are now talking about , because all right now is the recipe for chemical .
and every time it divides again , they all divide their chemistry .
and so all of these different bits are actually slightly different .
in fact , the drop of these different kinds of ways to make good reconnecting with chemical metabolism , which is slightly faster , and they dance more quickly and more  UNK  .
so these are the droplets of long-term trends that are actually more likely to express .
it &apos;s just a kind of chemical kind of life , but everything is slightly more interesting than when he got to extract the cat .
somehow we understand that we don &apos;t understand , but they &apos;re learning how to leave the edges .
they learn how to store information in the  UNK  of cells in a particular cell called dna .
in other words , they form of evolution , it doesn &apos;t allow them to write a form of how they can replicate .
now surprisingly , it was amazing how it seems to be stable because it evolved a half billion years ago .
in fact , our genes are the same , there are exactly the same way .
in fact , every living organism is stored in its genome with the symbols and the code of the same .
in fact , one of the things i &apos;ve done is that we can store this in a lot of stuff .
i have a hundred of these  UNK  , which i &apos;ve got to try to get to protect the airport .
but in this -- what i do is i do is to make code -- the code of the  UNK  code -- but it &apos;s a symbolic language -- and i write a business on top of my 10 or an  UNK  .
if anybody interested in those hundred million copies of my business , i can take a bunch of people in this room , and in fact , many of you , in fact , every single person in the world , and it &apos;s here .
but if i got a pretentious , i couldn &apos;t turn it into a kind of virus and let it go into this room .
so what &apos;s next step ?
setting up a structure of dna structure is an interesting step .
and it &apos;s made these cells -- these cells do this one another one billion years .
but then there &apos;s another one , there &apos;s another very exciting time to get things to become completely different from these cells , and communication and communication , and communications , and communication .
i don &apos;t know if you knows anything , but the bacteria can actually communicate dna .
because so , for example , the resistance of antibiotic resistance is being used .
some of the bacteria are able to find out that way of penicillin and bacterial populations around them , and today , and we have a lot of bacterial populations that are able to communicate , because the bacterial communities is  UNK  because of dna , the bacteria becomes resistant to the penicillin and so that we have access to penicillin .
this allows us to communicate with the bacteria that formation in that code ; they &apos;re all together ; they collaborate with bacteria .
and so they survive , they survive , it also grows , which means that if it means a community , it means that every single community in its own colonies .
at the time , when these communities come together , in reality , in fact , they form a whole colony of their lives .
and so the next process is very interesting in the life of about one billion years .
and at that moment , we have already , there &apos;s lots of different kinds of cell populations , work together .
and in fact , we &apos;re a colony living cells .
we have a lot of cells that they cannot survive .
the skin of everybody &apos;s not going to work without a lot of the existence of the heart cells , and there &apos;s a lot of cells .
so this colony , these colonies start to evolve over the course of evolution that doesn &apos;t happen on a cell populations that live on a population .
the next process is that in these communities .
but this population cells , again , starting to extract information .
and they begin to form a particularly relatively weak configuration either outside of the body .
and that &apos;s the neurological structures .
the brain cells is the process of information that the human cells .
and in fact , they &apos;re embedded in the pollen and structures that are responsible for taking notes , understand the facts , understand the information .
and that &apos;s the brain and the nervous system .
and they have the advantages of evolution .
because at the time , a single person -- dealing with something that happens in time , instead of living organisms , instead of having evolved over time .
so one of living organisms , for example , they don &apos;t eat an egg because it doesn &apos;t taste good at it , because it &apos;s too expensive to eat it .
this can happen during a lifetime that existed during a while still back in a present day , back in the structure of those particular information that may have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to evolve over by hundreds of thousands of years .
the nervous system , the fact that it turns out the fact that the very quickly apparent diversity that we &apos;ve evolved the process .
because evolution can happen in a day .
it can happen during the time .
but then what happened is that , of course , so of the tricks of communication .
for example , the most sophisticated version we know the language of the human language .
if you think about it , you &apos;ll see it as a great inventions .
i had a very complicated thought , messy , and ambiguity in the mind .
i &apos;m sitting here on the  UNK  , i &apos;m hoping to create a confusion , and there is a little bit of confusion of my mind .
but we &apos;re taking a very complicated thing , it turns into an english language , and it &apos;s a kind of going to form a complicated thought experiment .
this allows us to begin to exist as a living .
and in fact , what we &apos;ve done is humans , we &apos;ve started to know .
we &apos;re going through the same process of organisms that have been undergoing a sort of  UNK  --  UNK  , how we deal with  UNK  , the process information .
for example , the invention of the invention is a slightly different direction .
the phones , computers ,  UNK  cds , and so many other things that we create our incredible information in our society .
and they &apos;re all connected into a big community , faster than we &apos;ve ever evolved before .
so now , evolution can happen in a second part of the time .
people have seen the little example of the evolution of television that he has evolved over the course of a  UNK  program .
now we &apos;ve accelerate time frame over again .
so the first step of my first story told me one billion people in a year .
and the next stage , like the neurological and the brain , several hundred million years .
the next process , like language and other things that happens in less than a million years .
and the next process , like the power , it seems just a few decades .
this process went on and on its own , and i guess that &apos;s the appropriate speed for change .
the more change , the pace of it changed .
and i think it &apos;s something that we &apos;re seeing here , in the explosion of this curve .
we &apos;re seeing this process from ourselves .
now i designed computer to make money , and i know that the device i knew that design i could not use computers in the technology industry .
so now , what i &apos;m doing is to work with no material seemed to be impossible in traditional way .
i don &apos;t know of all of the transistor in a wall .
because there are billions of transistors .
instead , what i try to do is and do the kinds of things that are doing right now , where we think about how to extract the information and extract the comfort and try and extract them and extract the energy use , and extract the extract what they extracted our bodies , and we could faster and extract them and extract them and extract valuable .
and in fact , sometimes they do it because we don &apos;t even understand .
a particularly interesting approach that i &apos;m still using a lot of evolution .
what we do is we put in a machine in a process that happens in a second time frame .
for example , in case , in particular case , we can actually start with a program .
or , in other words , you can put hundreds of millions of random loose analogies .
now if you can do all the random wires run , all these random programs , and choose the closest to the program that i want to do with the closest thing i want to do . &quot;
in other words , i tried to figure out .
when i want to organize the example , a simple example that i do .
and find the closest to the number of jobs .
and of course , it &apos;s random will not tend to organize the numbers , so it &apos;s not a real job .
but one of them , if you &apos;re lucky , put two of them in place .
and i said , &quot; well , you can choose 10 percent of the random number one of the best work .
they hold it down .
so let &apos;s reset the  UNK   UNK  the number of  UNK  .
and copying or they reproduce the same in the same  UNK  . &quot;
take two programs and they &apos;re going to make a product by sharing their way , and they &apos;re considered for the rules of two .
i have now a new generation that &apos;s been produced by combining programs and the work that do a little bit better .
i said to the computer , &quot; repeat the process . &quot;
again , they evaluate it again .
maybe a few hours .
and again , it does it for another generation .
every single individual generation in every few milliseconds . blank .
and so i can do the evolution of a couple of million years in a computer just a few minutes , or in a few cases .
the process is , i &apos;m going to have the perfect record .
in fact , they &apos;re more effective programs than i could do a program .
now if i look at these programs , i don &apos;t know how they work .
i &apos;m trying to polls and show you how it works .
they are very ambiguous and  UNK  .
but they do it .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident , because they &apos;re done a bunch of work out of them .
in fact , the existence of these programs depend on her work .
i once sat on a table in a human mind with an ounce of  UNK  , and he said , &quot; look at that . look at this .
it says , &quot; well , this airplane has a details to let you have a safe situation to give you a safe place ? &quot;
in fact , we all know that the design process of building it was designed to be advantages .
so we &apos;re starting to depend on computers to do with a design process .
and it allows us to produce more complex products that allow us to build a product to design .
we still don &apos;t really understand the choice of it .
and so , in a view , it looks at us .
we &apos;re using the program to make those computers faster so we can do it faster than we can do it .
and so it &apos;s driving itself .
and this is happening increasingly , and that &apos;s why i see it &apos;s kind of ambiguous .
because all of this technology has driven himself .
we &apos;re taking off .
and we &apos;re at the moment in the same time that the same as being able to live in a cell .
we are some of the  UNK  amoeba , which is we can &apos;t understand what we &apos;re talking about .
we &apos;re at the moment .
but i think there &apos;s something that is breaking us .
i think we &apos;re going to get through the luxury of arrogance or  UNK  the end of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all here is part of the production -- that &apos;s what the next generation .
so i was near my lunch , and i think i &apos;m going to stop here , before i was invented by nature .
a few years ago i started a superstar program that superstar technologists and helps them to think about a year and working in the state .
this program is called for code for america , and it &apos;s like a computer programmer .
we choose a couple of years , they will work with cities .
instead of bringing them into the third world , we take them into a city .
well , they &apos;re going to write these cool applications , working with employees .
but what they &apos;re actually doing is they &apos;re actually building things that can happen in the social technology in the information technology .
let &apos;s say .
al qaeda in the ocean in boston .
it looks like a search for a date , but it &apos;s actually waiting for someone , because he knew that he was not at putting out to explode .
how does it look for help in a condition like this ?
last year , we had a team in boston code for america .
they &apos;re here in february .
they &apos;ll notice that city never abandon the  UNK  shed the fire .
but a member of the erik brynjolfsson -- it &apos;s a remarkable thing , which is that almost every  UNK  .
so he &apos;s doing whatever the work that anyone will do is going to write an app .
it &apos;s a little application that you can be  UNK  with the brigades .
you can lock it into the snow ooh .
every time you do that , you have to name it , and he named al gore .
if you don &apos;t do it , you can get it .
so there &apos;s a little bit of motivation .
this is an application .
perhaps the most relevant of the number of 21 states last year .
but it did something without a government .
it &apos;s viral .
one of the man in the city of honolulu , which is this case that you can actually use it , and it &apos;s not going to be the  UNK  of the tsunami , to gain access to pipelines .
it &apos;s important to work , but there are some people who stole energy from them .
so he can help people test .
and then decided to use this software to help people from the road entering the country .
chicago allows every  UNK  out to the sidewalk ,  UNK  out to the sidewalk .
there are now nine sustainable cities now using this app .
this is spreading out in a very rapidly , and nature has order .
if you know anything about the state of technology , you know that this would happen .
the birth of a software that used a couple of years .
last year , we have a team of three people working on a project in boston .
the project that parents worked out to the public school .
there are people talking to us like normal , to build a software that will have to take at least two million years .
but that &apos;s not the numbers .
now there &apos;s a real legal system that has spent a lot of those two billion dollars , which is still not working .
and a lot of the other projects in the state system .
so an app that &apos;s built in a very rapidly spreads , and it is that shortcut the whole system .
it shows how the way that the government works -- not unlike private companies , like many people think .
and it doesn &apos;t even look like a technology , the internet .
that means that there &apos;s no control , more shed and new things .
that &apos;s really important .
but the more important thing is that it shows is that it &apos;s about how to deal with -- not the problem of rigid structures of all .
it &apos;s an incredible amount of fun , because we &apos;ll have more action with the technology of electronic communication tech communities .
now there &apos;s a big community that helped build tools to allow us to work together .
it &apos;s not just about the code for america , for hundreds of america , and we were writing daily base on our own public daily basis .
they didn &apos;t abandon them .
they feel  UNK  governments , but they don &apos;t fix them , not fix them .
and these people know that we &apos;re not designed to hold it .
that &apos;s when you do away with each of these boundaries and all of us , and all the anger , the core of the key , in the heart of action . &quot;
now there are many people who lost their faith in government .
and if you are one of those people , i asked you to think about , because everything is changing .
political is not changing governments .
and by the only resolute that we go from a very small -- let &apos;s say , &quot; what do we think about it -- we &apos;re going to change the direction .
when i started this program , i don &apos;t know the government .
it &apos;s like many people , i think the government is basically voting .
after two years , i &apos;ve been able to conclude with the local government , with the rats .
this is the center of communication .
this is where you go to the  UNK  city if you call your own city .
if you have a chance to work in the center of city , like a member of our team -- in fact , all of us -- they &apos;re going to see a lot of people , i &apos;m going to see a lot of the issues within the click of a mouse .
scott &apos;s perception .
he typed in &quot;  UNK  into &quot; official data .
he didn &apos;t think of something else .
finally , he said , &quot; look , you can &apos;t have to open your door , and i can play a piece of music and look at it ? &quot;
and that &apos;s true .
but that &apos;s not all about rats .
boston is not only one .
it has an app , a website , and an app on the phone call  UNK  .
we don &apos;t write this app .
this is the work of the brilliant people at the city &apos;s office in boston .
so one day -- this is actually a report -- there &apos;s a whole thing that happens : &quot; a  UNK  in the trash .
how do you handle it ? &quot;
but what happened to  UNK  .
scott &apos;s talk .
but on top of the  UNK  , everything is shown to be transparent .
and in this case , someone who has seen .
so in the next report , &quot; i &apos;m walking in the region , again , a garbage can see the back in the house .
what about a  UNK  rat ?
you can put it in the roof .
well ,  UNK  , sleep  UNK  . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is interesting . this is exactly how technology is the approach to real life .
this is also an example of a typical public game .
but that &apos;s also an example of the state as a government system .
i &apos;m not talking about the definition of technology in the technology .
i &apos;m just talking about a support system for each other .
people helped each other , but the state patronage play here .
it connects two people together .
but essentially , the service of the government can connect them , one of the neighbors , and saving some of people &apos;s better and save the government of the services .
when this person made the bigger , our communities become bigger .
if you call the center of animal testing .
one of the things that we need to think about government is not the political .
most people understand that , but they think this is what they think this is the input .
the input system and the government election .
well , how many times we hold elections -- and we usually spend a lot of energy -- and we don &apos;t know a lot of energy -- and we hope that we will be reflected back to the requirements of the world , and what are we going to change ?
it &apos;s because the state of the oceans , and politics is a  UNK  of a single surface .
and what &apos;s in the lower east is what we call the bureaucratic administrative machine .
we feel sympathy with the contempt .
but it &apos;s contempt that we have for what we &apos;ve got to do something against us , and then we try to harm ourselves .
the politics is very exciting .
if we want to work for our authorities , we have to make it interesting .
because that &apos;s where the real work of the government .
we have to fund the mechanisms of governments .
that &apos;s what he did .
have you ever seen these people ?
it &apos;s a group of people who wrote a report on a long story to address the expense of the reports of this for reform .
it &apos;s not the political system , which is the bureaucratic bureaucracy .
for those of us who lost faith in our own government , and we &apos;d like to ask ourselves for our grandchildren .
you have to realize great challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
we &apos;re going to get the things that we need to do not get together ?
we can &apos;t do that without the government , we need it to achieve more effective .
great news is now helping technology to improve the function of government in a way to bring a public close to the community .
we have a generation with the rise of the internet , and we don &apos;t know what to do with each other , you just have the right direction .
now that &apos;s the average age of users , we are  UNK  , which is the envy of them .
this is a generation for their voices .
they don &apos;t look like us who are not going to speak out ; they &apos;re going to do it .
they can come up with any means of the vehicle , and they &apos;re still doing it .
when they face the problem with the women , they don &apos;t care about using their voice .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write their own hands to help the government work better .
these apps are helping us all societies .
it can be a  UNK  process , the fire hydrant , the grass , has the grass .
certainly , we can process the brigades as you do it .
but the apps like that remind us that we &apos;re not just the consumers , and we don &apos;t just pay for government , and we employ government service .
more than that , we are citizens .
and we can &apos;t settle for the government for doing good citizens .
i have a question for all of you here : when do it &apos;s important that we need to all of our hands , we will all be a collective voices of a collective voices , will be a team of hands in a group of hands ?
thank you .
i want to talk to you about why a lot of the reasons why it failed .
and i really think the most important thing is that we don &apos;t listen to this disease .
one of the things that we did in graduate school at the university of  UNK  .
it &apos;s not a scientific way -- she put a coffee cup or a cup of tea , and asked the family , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
what can we do ? &quot;
and we think this is one of the main problems that &apos;s why -- not all of us -- but most of all of the medical projects we fail , since we &apos;re not listening .
this is the electronic device . it &apos;s a simple device .
it has a knobs .
and each morning i &apos;m right .
and i &apos;m a lot of nervous and like you can see .
i &apos;m afraid that i went to  UNK  .
but the thing that makes this simple device doesn &apos;t matter whether i &apos;m gaining weight , it sends across all of my data to google its data .
and my doctor will also be able to get this data , to see the problems of my weight , but it &apos;s not only about my ear .
but another thing .
as some of you know that i have more than monitoring on twitter .
so every morning i don &apos;t need to get wifi on the car , and before i started saying to people , &quot; i &apos;m going to start with this lunch lady . &quot;
but it &apos;s the best possible thing that can happen because this is what a peer pressure that used to be a patient &apos;s peer review -- it &apos;s used to obesity , it can also be used to patients .
on the other hand , it &apos;s also used to get people out of the seat for some games .
i was soon , a device will soon be released .
that &apos;s the clock now connected with an iphone or something .
and people will be at home in my house at home , my blood pressure was even able to share data with someone else , and maybe 100 dollars over 100 dollars .
and this is the point that the patients can be able to document the health data and gathering data , not only from the control of its own crystal  UNK  , but also to help us maintain our own health care costs , but we need to health care for the health care costs , and we need for the same health care and so on the same health care .
it &apos;s easy to use techniques and start to use them to create the patients in the group .
and you can &apos;t just do it with these kind of techniques like this , but also remember the coming into the crowd . &quot;
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done with you , i &apos;d like to share a little clip with you .
we &apos;re all imaging inside the vehicle .
we even have it in the phone .
we know exactly how to go to the atm in the city .
another thing is that we know is that we all know where the petrol stations .
and certainly , we can find the food chain .
but there &apos;s no  UNK  device that could help the patients ?
we asked them around and nobody knew .
no one knows where the nearest  UNK  device to save lives right now .
and this is what we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve been using a solution in the netherlands , &quot; we &apos;ve been in holland .
we &apos;ve launched a front page and asked , &quot; if you can see a device , sends information to the back to where we know where it &apos;s going to be , &quot; because sometimes it doesn &apos;t know how it works sometimes .
and over 10,000 parts of the netherlands , and it &apos;s sent back to the home .
the next step we find these apps for it .
and we built an ipad on the app .
we built an app on the  UNK  possibility to actually find these devices to get these  UNK  devices .
and whenever you are in a city like a  UNK  where someone has met with your iphone , and you can use your iphone next few weeks , and within weeks , and i can use the smartphone app to save the lives that someone could save life .
and today we &apos;re going to show this is not just a product , but it &apos;s also called  UNK  .
and we want to start this device all over the world .
we remember all colleagues everywhere in the world , around the world , universities , to help us to go to university , to work and information act as a gathering of information in the world .
whenever you &apos;re on vacation where someone came back at least your relatives , you can either take somebody who &apos;s your eyes , you can still find a device that you can see .
the other thing that we really hope is that we can help the companies around the world to sustain this device .
these companies can be buddhas
so please help us do this , and it &apos;s not only healthier to manage it .
thank you .
i &apos;m here to share with you my own photography film .
does it have to be photography ?
because , maybe , this is photography that you can &apos;t bring a camera .
my hobby had photography of my interest when i had a camera in a 15-year-old .
it &apos;s a fascinating passion for painting , but there &apos;s a little bit different , because using a camera .
and when you use the camera to photograph the end of the process .
so photography offered me as a meditation of being true for time .
i feel like anybody can do it .
so i want to make a difference , something that &apos;s different from where you start to press a button .
but this is something like this : build a dense  UNK  path .
but it has a  UNK  .
and despite that , it &apos;s true  UNK  .
or the pictures like colorful -- i see color and colorful pieces of colorful , all of the  UNK  of the record .
when i say you &apos;re authentic , i mean you &apos;re your own .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually get , but i always wanted it to be , but it seems like this is a picture .
but the picture you &apos;re going to take a little bit of time to figure out a secret to life .
so it really is to embrace better idea .
what &apos;s the secret that makes it look like ?
is it a little bit of a detail or paint ?
is it a little bit about that light ?
what do you create illusions ?
sometimes it made the landscape .
but finally , it leads to how we do the world and how to figure out how to grab a two-way street .
it &apos;s not really what is , it &apos;s actually what we think it &apos;s real .
so i think it &apos;s quite simple .
i &apos;m just watching the puzzle of your reality is that you can take different parts of the reality that make a difference .
let me show you a very simple example .
we have three objects here in the perfect object , but objects that we can relate to the world in three dimensions .
but in a way , they create something that looks like that .
but at same time , we know each other .
so we deceive the brain , because the brain is simply not unacceptable that our brains are actually not the realistic agenda is actually  UNK  .
and i see that the combination of the same process .
it &apos;s really just a combination of different things .
so the things that makes you work in real , i think , is something that we haven &apos;t thought of the things that we &apos;d never thought of our lives in everyday life .
but when you synthesize images , it &apos;s a very important thing , which is that really important because if you don &apos;t think about it .
so i want to get the three basic principles of weeks to get done properly .
as you can see here , these photographs are in none of these pictures .
but together , they can create something like this .
so the first commandment is that you really have a picture of a  UNK  .
second , the combination of these images have a kind of light .
and these two pictures are both of satisfy two conditions -- which are also being done at a very same kind of light .
the third commandment is that it makes real in this fiction and it starts to end by making these circuits and work by making them circuits .
it &apos;s hard to talk about how to make images .
so by combining the colors , lighting and lighting the boundary between the lines and the boundary between the rich and the disabled , as the depth of our field , the color of the images , we &apos;ve taken away the rim between there , between the photos and the back to the edge of the ground .
so here &apos;s an example .
someone might think that this is just a picture of landscapes and it was already below the corrections suited .
these pictures are made completely ignored by the other .
i bet that i &apos;m going to even more easy to create a context , because you don &apos;t have to find the ideas in the context .
but it really does require a lot of plans .
and there &apos;s this idea in the winter , i knew i had to be months to prepare to find different locations .
for example , there is also switched on .
the shore is different .
the water is taken in a lake .
and also , i even lay out on the top of the island of the power of the island .
so to get a true outcome , i think about it comes to planning .
there &apos;s always a beginning with a sketching , an idea .
and then this is combining images .
and here , the parts are aligned .
and if you &apos;re good at pictures , you &apos;re going to be able to photograph .
every tool here is the right here , and the only thing we do is our own imagination .
thank you .
this may seem odd , but i &apos;m a big fan of the  UNK  of the stone .
but the first smoke is made in the manufacturing of the year from cement floor : the  UNK  of these  UNK  , which is basically fit in the size of a base .
the bricks fell in rapidly became the best material in the world .
they help us build the bigger buildings , the bridges , the buildings , bridges , each one of the bridges .
it might be a stone plates that &apos;s a brick of our age .
after nearly 100 years , in the &apos; 47 year , introduced this thing .
it &apos;s called a brick .
and just a few years in short , the lego blocks had taken at home .
according to estimates that there are over 400 billion  UNK  bricks to people on earth .
you don &apos;t need to be an engineer to build a gorgeous building bridges , beautiful bridges , but beautiful buildings .
the lego has become possible .
lego blocks had taken out of stone smoke , and building the world , and make it into your brick .
in the same year , bell labs in the bell labs , it &apos;s going to be published .
transistors are a  UNK  from the plastic that will take us from the world of a brick by another layer that are interacting from each other .
it &apos;s like a brick that happened in the circuit board and more complex , and slightly more complex than a brick .
but there &apos;s a big thing : the transistor is a big expert .
i personally accept this , that the brick of the bricks of the modern age , but i decided to professionals , so i decided to change it .
eight years ago i was in the lab at the media lab , i discovered that this idea is how to engineer and designers .
a few years ago i started growing .
let me show you how they work .
UNK  is from electrical devices .
they were designed to be available to the light , the engine , the sensor .
and the interesting part about them is that they stick together .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
but the &quot; brick with the stone .
green is the first , the power is the input , and the input are the orange .
so what you need to do is to make the green light , and it &apos;s very quickly that you can start to get into the bigger circuit board .
you get close to the blue light , you can get to the base .
you give you a switch to the middle and now you can get to the dark surround .
you see the  UNK  by creating this same thing , and now you have a circuitry .
it &apos;s a little bit closer and now you &apos;ve created the machine .
i &apos;m going to go .
as you &apos;ve seen , it &apos;s not just simple enough to play the act of a powerful tool .
instead of programming , has to teach you , let &apos;s take a simple program that lets you do it simple .
in order to make  UNK  flashes or slower , you can just throw this switch , you can simply change the pace .
the idea behind this is a kind of like a library .
we want to integrate the interaction in the world with the bricks . &quot;
the light bulb , the solar panel , the solar engine -- everything is accessible .
we gave them a little kids and watched them play with  UNK  .
and that &apos;s an amazing experience .
the best thing is that makes young children start to understand the digital tools that they &apos;re not in school .
so for example , how operating the door of the elevator  UNK  , open up close to your hand .
we also gave me a school teaching design courses .
so for example here we have the designers that don &apos;t know anything about computer music video gaming .
and here you &apos;ll see , along with a couple of seconds , and the water  UNK  bottle ,  UNK  ...
a few weeks ago we gave to risd and they &apos;re giving a few designs , and there &apos;s nothing with technical and wood -- and told me , &quot; tell them what to do . &quot;
this is an example of the project that they did , the triggers a movement that you do with a movement .
wait , it &apos;s my favorite project .
there &apos;s a fish that are put out of the dark and fear .
for the engineers , didn &apos;t have become a different kind of material , electronic medium .
and we want this material to be accessible to people .
so the  UNK  project is a open project .
you can go to the web , download and design from them .
we want to make the world leaders of inventors , and the people who have contribution to the world , because we &apos;re living in this world , we interact .
let &apos;s go ahead and start .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s of germany , if you &apos;ve got a typewriter , you &apos;ll have to sign it up with it .
not only , you have to sign up a piece of document from the red .
the purpose of this is to know the authorities could get the origin of the material .
if the regime was discovered that data was not the right to go back to the &quot; but go to the &quot; hang on . &quot;
and we are in the west can &apos;t understand why the truth is that it can be true of freedom of expression .
we &apos;re never going to do that .
but today , at the moment , in this year 2011 , if you have a  UNK  model from the  UNK  , and if you have a press , and if you have a document on paper , that red dot will be able to get the gold on the paper in a document from the kind of paper that kind of print you can kind of note from the page .
this is happening with us today .
and it seems like , &quot; no one &apos;s going to do this .
this is an example of how the government is we &apos;re using technology to fight against our citizens , our own citizens .
and this is exactly one of the three main characteristics in the present .
look at what &apos;s really happening in the world , we can categorize it , we can attack the attacker on the attacker , we could attack the attacker on the attacker .
there are three sources of  UNK  .
from crime networks carrying crime networks .
like here , we have  UNK  from  UNK  to the kiev , ukraine , ukraine .
and the motivation is very simple , and it &apos;s easy to understand .
make money !
they use online activities for a lot of money to make a lot of money .
for example , some of these  UNK  millionaire offered four million people who earned money from attacks .
this is supposed to come from  UNK  estonia , estonia , estonia , estonia , the estonia , estonia .
alfred  UNK  .
stephen dish .
climate change .
matthew  UNK   UNK   UNK  &apos;s  UNK  and so on .
they &apos;re looking for wealth through the operations , through various ways of using illegal hacking the banking system to attack the money from the bank account of our accounts for doing online damage to the software that they can help track their online record from the hardware store when we get  UNK  from the people who are infected with their online purchases .
the united states , two months ago , the bank account followed by the swiss , who is sam  UNK  million dollars in the delivery room .
mr. jain monk is coming ; and nobody knows where he is .
and i said that today we &apos;re in the  UNK  of the cybercriminals that we have more than the real risk in this world .
and an obvious truth is that these risks are being bad .
in the future , it &apos;s not going to be illegal in the world .
the second kind of thing that we see today is not for money .
they are driven by the goals -- the political dissent , a dissent , and sometimes it is just fun .
anonymous groups have been  UNK  for 12 months , and it became a very essential game that would be a vital part of the game .
so we have three groups of  UNK  : criminals to respond to the money to protest that when they get engaged in our government to protest , our governments are failing .
there are many cases like what happened in  UNK  .
this is an example of what &apos;s going to happen when the government does the citizens of their own citizens .
UNK  is a  UNK  cable company to themselves -- or they &apos;re at least .
they had to stand for the fall of depended for the network .
someone gets hacking it in the system and totally destroyed it .
in the last week , one of the dutch government , i met the dutch government , i had a question of leadership pipelines is that if nobody had to die , because if somebody had to attack not die .
and he said , &quot; he was his answer .
how does this attack the person to attack ?
UNK  is a company service provider .
they &apos;re security , they &apos;re just security .
what are you going to do with that degree ?
in fact , you need a wire that if you have a web service to  UNK   UNK   UNK  service , is how to switch the gmail is gmail , being used to gmail , is using mobile .
all of us , or at least we &apos;re using gmail , or being used a switch to gmail , and these particular blogs are used in places like gmail , how being used to switch from gmail , being used by gmail , being known as being constrained because they don &apos;t know the other position of being used by the information that they can &apos;t hear about the communication of the information that they can exchange of information .
but everything else would , if the government could put the unit into its unit and they just security .
and they created fake madness .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened with  UNK  .
what about the arab spring and what happened in egypt ?
at egypt , once the  UNK  of the  UNK  headquarters in january the case of egypt in january the year 2011 .
in that file , which is called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
in this document from a company which is a german company that you have spent a lot of advanced technologies to pull up a lot of high technology to hear on a massive scale and exchange of information .
they have these tools for the government officials who were euros at  UNK  charge .
this is the main campaign headquarters .
so the western powers are providing governments that are providing government tools to fight against their hands .
but the west does the same thing in your country .
for example , in germany , a couple of weeks ago that people had discovered , is a german government official officer .
if you are involved in trying to get involved in something , it &apos;s definitely your phone . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about it .
they hear the internet traffic on the internet .
they will even use the  UNK  tools to get to infect the  UNK  of the computer , and then you can get the exchange information that you get through the conversations , having a conversation through your network , and you have a conversation .
however , there are some people going to be looked like this , &quot; okay , but it &apos;s not what i &apos;m going to be an citizen .
so why am i nervous ?
i was absolutely nothing left with marks respect for the marks .
but this argument is not rational .
privacy is supposed to make sure .
their own right to argue .
this is not a problem between privacy and security .
this is a problem between liberals and control .
and while we still believe in the state right now , in this year 2011 , in today that every single year .
and are we going to have a blind faith in the future , in the government ?
that &apos;s the question that we &apos;re going to be worried about 50 years .
