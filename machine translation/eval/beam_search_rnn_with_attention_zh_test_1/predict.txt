and i went through a group that we couldn &apos;t do it was the only challenge that we were doing .
privacy is going to talk about .
so , april , the great story of the fiction , a boat pops up to the north sea .
this is jimmy  UNK  .
i work every day .
we &apos;ve heard a few words .
this is one of my weight weight , which is a very simple thing .
we &apos;re going to look at some really interesting .
i wanted to go back to the general public health of ivory coast of ivory coast of  UNK  , grandmother and the two daughters have lived in 20 years , all of us have been around 20 years .
now , if i &apos;m going to say , for example , another technology , it &apos;s kind of transportation , and on the curve curve , it looks like a spiral staircase .
and if you &apos;re in beloit , you can see someone from your iphone , and you can buy a mobile phone in your iphone , and you can actually save lives for a thousand years to save lives .
it &apos;s a group of people who are building a lot of people in new cities in downtown cities .
the point is that there &apos;s a or a bunch of complications showing how they &apos;re going to share their views .
you need to realize that they have to challenge huge challenges .
you can &apos;t do it .
we have online online .
all of these things are connected together , and we get bigger and bigger and faster .
and all of these technologies come in .
&quot; she goes back . &quot; she &apos;s like this .
so every morning i washed my weight weight , and i started to talk to people and said , &quot; i want you to play tonight tonight , right ? &quot;
it &apos;s just like the last yesterday .
but if there &apos;s something like this one .
so now , evolution has been fine-tuned on a subtle basis .
why should i worry ?
it comes from seattle .
in the u.s. institute , the institute of the u.s. institute was 10 years ago .
in the history of the technology history , it hasn &apos;t exported any of the history of technology .
and then you can put it down .
we can &apos;t government , and we need to become more efficient .
if we have an idea of family , it has to be women in women .
two things happened .
two years later , when i was in a prison hospital in a rural hospital in a rural hospital in toronto , i met a 27-year-old man who was born at a 27-year-old age .
and in the west , we can &apos;t understand how someone can do this , which is the expression of compassion .
so imagine that this device relies on a lack of medicine , 25 percent of the burden in the developing world .
because as a result , as a  UNK  , it &apos;s easy to give up to the hypothetical seriously .
let &apos;s think about mobility .
in fact , we know that the engineering process is not working well .
who knows the  UNK  rainbow or  UNK  , or  UNK   UNK  ?
again , my intuition works .
it &apos;s not changed in the few centuries .
it &apos;s an antidote to life expectancy , called  UNK  .
somehow we can &apos;t fully understand what we can &apos;t understand .
nothing is . he begins with the control of the animal .
next step , the nervous system and brain .
and at the same time , we have three million dollars in order to put some people in solitary confinement , just because of t.b.  UNK  , or a little bit of  UNK  , and we don &apos;t give them an opportunity to kill the orangutans .
it was like , organic , organic nature .
it was married to children &apos;s lives .
we have many cells , they &apos;re not just survive .
the point is .
eight years ago , when i was in the media lab , i started thinking about how to bring the tools of the engineers and engineers designers .
i spent some errors in the last five years .
it gave her the aspirin , and gives her to a cure for her heart .
the primitive ones are formed in some sense , these little  UNK  clouds .
but on that day , what happened in this particular friday ?
now i want to my own little town .
&quot; impossible . &quot;
i did this guy in this year , and i &apos;m not sure i bought a bag of wine .
UNK   UNK  , the great leaders of this ,
so let &apos;s take a closer look .
and the faa -- you know , if you put a thousand pounds in the aircraft carrier , we would not be able to make this thing .
what do you write about freespeech ?
so now we &apos;re going to step back again .
ladies and gentlemen , giving me a huge positive confidence in the future , is one of the opportunities that are challenged by the challenge .
tan le  UNK  is a refugee community , and it &apos;s refugees , and social activists are invited to talk to a talk to a place where we never heard about anywhere .
i said , &quot; we want to challenge the challenge for injustice .
they were in 7th , back in 1979 , last year .
i was married in the back of the night , and the ambulance came up with her home .
and the fact that we actually have a couple of cases where we are all online , online  UNK  .
so what i &apos;m going to do is look at pictures of time and time .
so this little video shows what we &apos;re doing .
why would i choose a medical ?
it causes chains of cells -- and they &apos;re sorry for hundreds of years .
and these programs allow us to provide our hands with our own hands .
and i wish i could tell you the worst mistake that i had failed , and that was five years ago at the beginning of my undergraduate colleagues , and i was completely  UNK  .
we have a huge increase in social change during the effects of events in the 20th century , and in fact , at the speed of this century , we &apos;re going to be in the next 30 years in the future 30 years .
so this is the brain and the nervous system .
people were running out , and everybody was upset .
it shows that , in terms of the understanding of the human mode , the model of complexity is still better than the best computer .
they &apos;re using their hands with their hands to program their programs .
other doctors doctors are scared to these three words , but because the patient doctor looked at what they were looking for , and these three words were special to us .
when i was a young boy , i saw her first hug .
you see , these images are not special .
oh , my god !
so he did any good programmers , what he did . he wrote a app .
privacy is important .
we want to change a death penalty .
because with the  UNK  de  UNK   UNK  , this metaphor conjured with something that we can talk to the audience to the audience .
but many of them are idiots .
their motive is -- they are gripped by  UNK  , by the way .
and it turned out to the x-rays , and the result was normal . my colleague was examining the diagnoses of the patient at the time when patients came up with a patient on the right day .
california is  UNK  to a billion dollars a year for a billion dollars a year , and it doesn &apos;t work .
now , for us , we &apos;ve given up our government to our government , is to ask what we want to leave behind ourselves .
and i started to do that , headline , &quot; which is my favorite number of children who wanted to become a  UNK  white group . &quot;
and this is a huge increase in her this year , but she &apos;s &apos;s recovery .
maybe it &apos;s because i &apos;ve been studied for many years , and i &apos;ve got to give up a fantastic opportunity to start like this .
we know that there &apos;s nothing to think about the future , 50 or three decades , because all of this earth will be so profound to the possibilities of the future .
what do you do with it ?
every september 8 minutes of 16 kilos on earth .
however , i was interested in my photographs to photography , and i was 15 years old .
the biggest threat is , death and death .
and we wanted to compare each individual as a single fragment of one laptop per person .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i thought it would be this way .
if i &apos;m going to go to one of my colleagues in my room , i asked them to talk to them and start talking to them , and maybe i didn &apos;t talk about over two stories , and they &apos;ll probably tell you a little joke .
this is what we &apos;re here today .
it doesn &apos;t seem like this .
now i &apos;m standing in the comfort zone , and the world is far away from the outside world , not the way you &apos;re worried about it .
and the key to the crux of the importance of understanding is the subtle details of human languages .
and she reminded me , she took us a trail of a program .
and it doesn &apos;t provide information .
she was married 17 years ago to marry betty ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
&quot; ma &apos;am , did you write this one ? &quot;
and then you add a pulse sensor , and you now create a little torpedo .
in fact , none of you know that in a medical surgeon who knows a good surgeon , doctor or parkinson &apos;s disease should be .
that &apos;s great .
because that is , because the individual can learn from individual individual scientists to learn from the organism , but rather than the entire evolution of evolution .
but there are more than 48 hours of hours of youtube .
after a trip .
every hundred years , every time it &apos;s not a terrestrial chemistry .
when i started thinking about it in the last year , i knew i had a couple of months to go into account for a few months , and basically all the different versions of the jigsaw .
10 minutes , i &apos;m going to tell you about the women &apos;s women &apos;s grandmothers , the amazing how old lady and her sister and her sister and her sister and her sister , she &apos;s five years old , and five days later on the coast of maine for the past couple of years on the coast of the coast of the past four days -- and the little girl in the past four days , the little girl who has not been enjoying in san francisco today , and this little girl is going to live
but we also knew that it couldn &apos;t exist .
we said , &quot; no one . &quot;
some people say you will never forget the names of your lungs .
this old black man stood up and looked at this , and i looked at him , and i said to him , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell this young man . &quot;
that &apos;s why the top top is  UNK  .
political doesn &apos;t change , but the government is changing .
and talk about what i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
you &apos;ve seen the evolution of the  UNK  evolution that you see in front of your eye , as if you look at it in your mouth  UNK  .
it &apos;s last fall in the late last because it was criticized .
after three months of months , we lived in the womb .
if you have to competition , this device needs to provide a diagnosis for your employers .
thank you .
this is one of the biggest problems from the internet today .
but it was wrong .
so when they faced with the government , they didn &apos;t care about their stories .
but we have a fear of fear of death penalty opponents .
jimmy fallon : the remix to bring this video
oh my god !
it &apos;s called  UNK  percent .
think about it . in one of the great britain in kenya , one of the great american soldiers have more than three years ago .
so let me ask a question ...
so let me tell you a little bit of this .
we &apos;ve come to realize as a teacher , and if you &apos;re an entrepreneur , if you &apos;re a very good teacher .
and we put her on a leash .
so it &apos;s  UNK  .
i think there &apos;s a lot of ideas to understand how life comes out of agriculture , but i want to talk about the simple story of life , which is , in that time , there are landlines in  UNK  , and there &apos;s different types of chemicals .
&quot; remember ? what do you go home ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t . it &apos;s ok . i don &apos;t drink . &quot;
in fact , these devices are much better than my body .
my good friend steve  UNK  demos the tools of any technology of technology , which is the curve , moore moore &apos;s law , moore &apos;s law , and it &apos;s doubling every year .
she said , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
another patient has alzheimer &apos;s disease .
bear  UNK  : oh my god . oh oh my god .
her parents were really enthusiastic .
he was a poet and a national monument life in the country .
as humans , we are too good at suspending these crises , but we end up again .
today i &apos;d like to share with you my photographs .
and i &apos;d like to remind you that it &apos;s very challenging for the most pessimistic  UNK  .
this is happening in these groups .
somebody  UNK  ruins completely destroyed .
and i believe that means that we have a crisis .
this is  UNK   UNK  .
let me give you a simple example .
the skin doesn &apos;t work , and if there &apos;s no heart cells , muscle cells , muscle cells , and so on .
in my opinion , this profoundly profoundly changed completely changed the world .
in  UNK  , they choose to leave her to leave -- the lady lady , a mother , a mother , mother and grandmother .
we &apos;re going to try to bring this into the world .
so one night i &apos;m asleep , and i &apos;m not going to say , oh my god , if the judge can give you another one who has the magic .
but the problem on the other side is our self .
i personally can &apos;t accept the word of our generation that we can actually play , and so i decided to change it .
they want to say , &quot; listen , i listen to the same . &quot;
four  UNK  :  UNK  .
it &apos;s not allowed to be or more or more or more useful possibilities .
and walk along the route .
UNK  ? very good .
and that &apos;s what happens .
and that &apos;s how it works for us .
so what you &apos;re saying is that you have a certificate on a file site , a  UNK  service , a service suit .
of course , the brain is important for reasons .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m confident confident , and they can finish their tasks because they &apos;re able to do that .
what we did was we put in a machine in the machine process , and that process is going to happen in a subtle period of time .
the more i &apos;m talking about , the more i invite you .
what else would you do ?
so the nervous system , biological organisms , organisms have evolved to accelerate the progress of evolution .
if they found that they were writing a wrong word , they could track the idea of that .
there was a lot of time , and i was a little too .
and this is the  UNK  movement in the united states .
i believe that we need to give people more altruistic and more than giving them not enough .
this is a story of  UNK  , in  UNK  .
as i was as young as i was growing up in the process , like in 2000 , people were going to talk about 2,000 years from 2000 .
we &apos;re actually doing this now .
her brain damage is paralyzed by damage .
tm :  UNK  crowds , communities and others .
this assumes that you live in a remote remote area , and the two percent of your people are attracted to each other .
because from the energy source , from the most part of the people , from the most part of the people , how we &apos;re going to change in changing it changes .
and if you &apos;re one of them , i hope you &apos;ll be able to do it , because lots of things are changing .
and then , in a few years ,  UNK   UNK  has a family .
now this is four quarters of the black people in sao paulo .
because this is obviously a photograph , but you &apos;re not using camera .
at the time , i was in my  UNK  , and my mother was raised to cardiovascular clinics .
i &apos;m here today because i believe this is a lot of people who understand the world &apos;s perception of this world , even though it &apos;s going to be
he said , &quot; i &apos;m very proud of you . &quot;
i shake it .
my job is to lie awake .
now , the transistor is a small piece of plastic that will allow us to shift from the  UNK  to the new world into the new world .
but every time i thought about this in the way that it would hurt me .
but for many years .
the mother started to work in rural village , and they went to six weeks ago .
i think there &apos;s no argument in philosophy today who doesn &apos;t have any  UNK  .
i think the reason is that we feel what we &apos;re doing .
this is rick warren buffet , eric whitacre .
i &apos;m going to snatch them for the third world , but they &apos;re
we &apos;re not just doing it , we are .
and a friend of mine , a series of condensed teds , an astronaut video is a protest of san francisco , and i have to admit that i &apos;m not interested in .
&quot; the big picture . &quot;
we see it on the mobile phone .
now , i didn &apos;t have to do what i should do , and i take the phone rang and give him a case to give him a chance to a patient .
even if you do it , it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a serial killer .
a few days later , we went to the queen of  UNK  , sitting next to her .
what happened ?
maybe there may be no  UNK  , i can take care of my patient with me , to take care of his patients .
and the way that we learned from this knowledge is that the people who are responsible for them .
in 1947 about 16,000 years ago , they had this .
we also used to bring back to design school .
they &apos;ll use a similar tool kit with a  UNK  tool that you can get in your computer , which allows them to hack into communications , and you &apos;re talking about your code .
it &apos;s kind of like this .
when she was born , the father died .
because it &apos;s because of that point where we actually start to understand how we feel about it .
after two days later , i went to my aunt on my tongue .
it &apos;s necessary for me .
so i went to a lot of  UNK  and education , education , education and political rights and political rights .
so you &apos;ve got to add a little bit more dynamic , and you create a  UNK  machine .
and that &apos;s the ability to have the ability to open up .
sometimes different visions of different visions .
it &apos;s like a virus .
for me , it takes to spend a lot of time thinking about the poor and the people who don &apos;t have the opportunity to become ted .
what does it help us ? &quot;
and this isn &apos;t because my responsibility is neither good for me .
so neurons are the machinery of these cells .
UNK   UNK  .
these principles are my my belief that we should persist .
and the more changed , the more quickly changed .
a civil society is another citizen , and the government is part of the role .
what are they going to do ? what are they wishes ?
but it really requires a lot of planning .
today , things are far beyond today .
in the future , most of the crime will happen .
ha , wait a minute .
and i said , &quot; well , this is my worst mistake , &quot; and i &apos;m going bad news from one of the worst mistakes , and i said , &quot; this is my worst mistake . i &apos;m going to send the microphone , &quot; and then i &apos;ll send the microphone and say , &quot; what do you ? &quot;
so , i picked up the island of the island in the air , and i think it would look like the wind blowing .
this is a prison opportunity .
i &apos;m not robots ; i don &apos;t do the same thing .
in 1972 , there were 10,000 feet in 1972 .
&quot; remember ? what do you see in the first day ? &quot;
there are hundreds of thousands of times over 50 million years .
there are some chemicals in the chemical soup of this chemistry , and that gives them a lot of  UNK  from their environment .
and we can &apos;t get rid of this .
last month , i &apos;m very fortunate to share with the nih for 9.3 million dollars .
i said , &quot; yes , this is what i &apos;m writing .
my patient isn &apos;t a car ; they don &apos;t use their same way to describe their symptoms .
there are three three strands .
but i still worked with it .
let &apos;s get statistics .
let &apos;s compare this metaphor for other purposes .
don &apos;t .
they come from our wisdom and our intellectual beliefs .
now , why not ?
i feel nervous nervous -- very nervous .
so , ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s going to be about 350 percent of our energy expenditure .
well , we &apos;re working on a daily basis in a situation where every child is going to give the wrong end of a single day , or to the percentage of incarceration , and suffering from harm &apos;s disease and death .
but there &apos;s one of the things that i did was , and i took this code , and there &apos;s this storage that we use to put it in a nice letter , and then i put my buttons on the other side to 10 times as much as 10 minutes .
and the best thing that they are synchronized with  UNK  .
the united states is the only country in the world who can live in jail .
so all the tools in fact is the only thing that our tool is our imagination .
and what my job is , when medicine is needed to have a patient in the heart of a heart attack .
UNK  is hundreds of thousands of years .
how does it work with such a way to help help ?
in fact , it &apos;s beginning to look at experts and the specific components of understanding , understanding , understanding , learn .
babies have 10 times a mortality rate .
but i remember the reflection of the oil  UNK  from the gulf of  UNK  from jordan , from lhasa to death , and i end up with the first apple of my favorite apple , from a man named  UNK  .
we need to keep our technology to keep track patients .
nobody knows that the automated immune system will be able to find .
it &apos;s kind of odd . i &apos;m a lefty  UNK  .
he had uploaded many of his bright videos .
there &apos;s no  UNK  center .
maybe i don &apos;t want to be a  UNK  .
these are the problems that we &apos;re asking for the next 50 years .
but the most important thing is that inspired creativity , the  UNK  culture .
and then the people were able to measure the data out of the blood pressure , allowing them to send their data to their doctors , but they also share it with other people .
i said , &quot; what are you saying ? &quot;
you don &apos;t need people to consume .
but i think there &apos;s something to be with us .
when a neighbor comes to another &#93; , our society is cooperation .
now we know the nine cities that are going to use it .
and it was a lot more about 40 percent of the country .
so the first principle is all of all of a series of images of images .
UNK  is a specific piece of electrical components .
again , again .
people knew about their risk .
and these are often gathered together .
so they &apos;re longer longer , and they get more .
so i think these ideas are very simple .
our survival is survival .
but we &apos;re moving into something called complexity , into a sound , and you &apos;re complicated in your brain .
and it wasn &apos;t just that i didn &apos;t write it .
we have to participate in government systems .
a couple of weeks ago , we took a trip to the rhode island school , and we tried it to a bunch of designers who had no engineering and crafts , paper and paper -- and they said , &quot; do something . &quot;
and it &apos;s just a small number .
the coast was shot in another place .
but now the web video shows it , it allows us to make creative decisions and then become a part of the world .
i found the  UNK  on the charts .
remember , 1990 , carl sagan , carl sagan came out of saturn in the harbor of saturn , and it was in the direction of the earth .
i &apos;m saying that because i think it &apos;s important to think .
it &apos;s hard to imagine what happens when you &apos;re in hospitals at a kiosk .
and someone who &apos;s done in the lobby department of this , this guy has taken this program , and realized that it doesn &apos;t have to use it , and it can also translate the freedom of citizens .
but thinking , they &apos;re actually in a way that they &apos;re in our lives .
something is fueled by my heart .
and she said , &quot; you &apos;re a special kid . &quot;
we &apos;re sent to the whole host of congress .
it costs 50 percent .
so in a few days , we only got to program a program of virus , which was a sign to the government agencies .
we &apos;re on the tipping point .
and the thing i learned is that it was absolutely everywhere .
even when i finished my class , i realized that i couldn &apos;t afford to law law .
and that is when you look at the  UNK  of our hearts , for example , how we feel guilty about the politics of our politics , our government ,  UNK  , say , &quot; government can help us make something better . &quot;
but i can hold it , and i look at them safely , and that &apos;s what i hope .
but the truth is .
in the poor community , in a community of  UNK  , that desperation is hopelessness .
but in the middle , there &apos;s a good luck , and it &apos;ll probably split two points .
so i went to court .
it gives us a sense of how to create it .
in egypt , in egypt , egypt , egyptian egypt , egypt in egypt , egypt , in 2011 , for example , in 2011 , they found a lot of documents .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re connected to each other .
and my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;re not going to survive . it &apos;s a hotel between us .
and all of the soldiers had poured up their neighbors , and the temple were sold .
i would weigh my weight  UNK  .
i said , &quot; repeat this process . &quot;
but these reactors don &apos;t really live alive , and now we &apos;re looking at them because of each one of these chemicals .
but metamaterials is surprising .
but the problem is that if i can &apos;t talk to talk about what i &apos;m going to talk about , and if i can &apos;t find the wrong side of the wrong answer , how i can share my experiences and my colleagues ?
however , we don &apos;t understand it .
and that can happen in a single life in a single organism , and then this particular structure of this structure is built over the course of the  UNK  structure , which has evolved to regrow the offspring of death .
so these groups evolved into this evolutionary evolution , not only a single cell , but what we call a  UNK  organism .
you can go on websites , download all of these files , create themselves .
now i &apos;m going to replicate the data about the data .
but if you combine these objects together , you can create a kind of optical object in 3d , and it &apos;s as if it &apos;s going to be there .
this person is -- it &apos;s a guy who is completely innocent .
and then i went back to the carter and  UNK  and then , and then later , again , went back to the job , until they didn &apos;t go back .
so if someone needs a lot of me on my card , i have 30 cents to everyone in the room , even in the world .
often , when i go to my grandmother , it &apos;s hard to tell her to me , and i have time .
i know she &apos;s poem .
the whole hive , which is the red line , which is the original joke , becomes a joke .
if we have enough energy , we have a lot clean water .
but nevertheless , it still has a sense of identity .
it &apos;s a  UNK  slice of it . it &apos;s a lot of tribal chiefs .
so he asked citizens to examine them .
and i didn &apos;t really make it wrong for a while , until i met a lady .
bf : oh yeah , i &apos;m going to have a piece of paper you can see .
in fact , if i had my colleagues , i found a fellow colleague from the hospital who had been diagnosed with legs , believe me , as i met , i couldn &apos;t negotiate with him .
and i thought , &quot; well , good laughter . i &apos;ll do it . &quot;
some of you may think it &apos;s just a single part of it .
you know , ultimately , we &apos;ve got to believe that you don &apos;t see anything .
it &apos;s not that that &apos;s the information that we accept .
there &apos;s even more  UNK  .
steve jurvetson tells us that we &apos;re living in the most peaceful time in human history .
and how do i teach them to let them go back ?
there &apos;s also inventors .
over the past hundred years , thousands of times over the last hundred years , increase over the last hundred years , and according to the number of per capita income increase in the world .
UNK  ,  UNK  . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s going to become scarce resources .
now , most of us , most of us , using  UNK  or  UNK  ,  UNK  services , especially in the country , especially like foreign dictatorship , because they know that they &apos;re more  UNK  service , because they knew that they are much more reliable than they can track .
UNK  did it . when he noticed that patient was a little  UNK  , and they also had a heart attack .
also , the cost of cost , we spent tens of thousands of dollars -- gps tracking and  UNK  and medical diagnostics -- not to be typed into your phone .
so you can &apos;t be wrong .
the only challenge was she had a 10-year-old .
in this case , this lady said , &quot; because our history is our history , and we have a choice to kill .
so each sand is a little different .
i even know how to make a diagnosis of  UNK  ,  UNK  .
at first , i thought we were playing games .
when she was in the middle of the at 17,500 miles , i was in a hotel room in sydney .
and if you did that , you can name the name ; he called the first al gore .
and i like this : &quot; the ancient debt . &quot;
what they need is a cultural justice culture .
thank you .
and i have to apologize and acknowledge that .
and then backed up my mother .
because it &apos;s not our problem .
in other words , they came up with this way that we can write , and write the code of how they &apos;re genetic information , so that &apos;s how we can copy .
i want to talk to you a little bit about a lot of health care programs .
and we wanted to make this material .
and all of that , i &apos;ve been asking myself , what is the future of the future of the future ?
so the heart of this heart is my core beliefs , and our societies have to participate in .
unlike the real world entertainment , media media , which is a collective community that will allow us to be able to become more relevant to the phenomenon of the phenomenon .
so if you think it &apos;s amazing , you become more difficult to imagine this , three hours of three hours a day .
what do you hear when people hear about yourself as a time ?
for example , in most extreme cases , we actually actually evolved a single sequence of random sequence of sequences .
the judge said that he was a adults , but i only saw one child .
UNK  is the authority authority in the netherlands . it used to be .
this is the main reason why we are .
this gives them a evolution of evolution .
a series of things we &apos;ve never had before .
i grew up in denmark , like many other halls , if you &apos;re sentenced to your political power .
i &apos;ve been in  UNK  , in prison , in death row .
the headquarters headquarters there .
and we &apos;re going to want to seduce the companies around the world , allowing us to verify these things .
some of the bacteria know how to get away from the penicillin , and it creates it into oxygen , and in the bacteria , there &apos;s a lot of bacteria that &apos;s immune to kill bacteria .
if it weighs about 400 percent of the earth  UNK  , but it &apos;s not  UNK  .
and i think that &apos;s all of us to be part of the transformation , whatever the next step .
margaret heffernan : what does it mean ?
in the same stimuli , i had two patients who had failed symptoms .
and she said , &quot; your mother was my assistant , you have to hug me you would love her . &quot;
and when you put the best protein in the best of an expert , not mit , mit , not a student at mit , but a young man in upstate new england , and during the first time in the u.k. , the day of the world &apos;s best experts in the world .
but it doesn &apos;t be eradicated .
it was 70 percent of the surface of the earth .
and in fact , it &apos;s exactly the whole thing to do that , i put it into my data , put it into my data .
last year , we had a two-year group of  UNK  , and we did a questionnaire for two months .
i said , &quot; computer , please have a 10 percent reduction in the sequence .
and if we look at these chemicals , we start figuring out what they &apos;re formed .
but that may not that , because this is the stress of stress , and stress is helping stress help , but it can help revolutionize help .
at the same time , i realized that as an interaction could be , as a result , the news on the screen were not only , but something was that there was a lot of experience from a boat .
he invited a dinner party for dinner .
we all love baseball , isn &apos;t it ?
&quot; because you &apos;ve been in the morning , &quot; now he said .
i &apos;m a human , and i &apos;m going wrong .
and in fact , our genes are exactly the same code , same way .
so the wrong error is .
UNK   UNK  .
i was also talking about the death penalty .
what is the context ? what &apos;s happening in egypt ?
on the other hand , i was suffering from the dangers of violence , violence against racism and apartheid .
and one day -- this is a real report -- this message was printed in &quot; menu . &quot;
he plays a lot of money , and he can hear people complain about grievances .
faced with anger .
and what i &apos;m going to talk about is the timeline of life on earth on earth .
i mean , look at the point of view .
thirty billion people don &apos;t have to talk to each other .
and it was called  UNK  , and calls me up to me and said , &quot; my wife comes back , we &apos;re going to do it .
because it &apos;s not what you can actually do , but i don &apos;t think that it can be used indiscriminately .
and in the next two hours , she starts getting better .
most of our ideas are crazy , and there &apos;s a few good stuff .
but if you don &apos;t smell it , other people can carry it from you .
&quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
don &apos;t talk .
and when we say it was a  UNK  of  UNK   UNK  .
they &apos;ll be because of using mobile phones to become more healthy and more healthy , because it &apos;s because of the khan academy becomes brighter , and it &apos;s more powerful and more powerful than any enjoyment .
given the child to expose the child of the child to expose the bloodshed .
and i said , i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to . &quot;
and i bought him in the jar of penicillin , and he threw him away .
so , for example , the most elegant version of what we know is the human languages .
these two patients have done surgery .
because evolution can happen in the individuals .
it &apos;s almost like the immune system in the immune system , the antibodies are attacking the same person .
and what &apos;s amazing about this is that this kind of way to look like , because it looks like 25 million years ago .
i believe , every single person on this planet .
wealth wealth is not the end of the end .
in fact , we are so many of these cells .
one of the time i was waiting to talk to them , i said , &quot; i said , &quot; brian brian and i talk about your equality .
they can express any information to any decision in their time , and they do it .
and there &apos;s more important information than ever before , and that message across the sensory input is a part of the temporal lobe of the brain .
mortality is bad precedent in the united states .
they can also , if they attacking the chief authority authority , they attacked a protest .
atlassian is a authority certificate .
i think anyone can do this .
i was startled and scared .
and i spent her home , and i asked her back home .
i just want to mention a platform where people can help people .
or there &apos;s a picture like this , but it &apos;s also about perceiving color , but for the purpose of purpose .
let &apos;s take a look at a similar company company .
in fact , instead of different proteins are allowing them to be able to better integrate around the world , bigger and bigger .
some people make false papers .
we don &apos;t write the program .
and our judicial system is not just changing the conventions , but it &apos;s also part of the abyss .
i was never swum , and i hadn &apos;t been picked up .
and i looked at his throat , and he looked down .
he was dying . he died .
but recently , what &apos;s the gift of the patient &apos;s body ?
and he saw me , and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
what do they want ?
and they don &apos;t notice that they don &apos;t have a  UNK  out of the city .
so how are people who are dying ?
but we don &apos;t care .
this project is called the &quot; code code , &quot; it &apos;s like a  UNK  .
i started a little bit more .
the cat is watching this cat .
i have a picture ,  UNK  , a black kid .
hello . i &apos;m kevin kelly , and i &apos;m youtube trends , and i &apos;m watching youtube videos .
today i &apos;m going to show you a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
but this is also a very good example of government .
there &apos;s an interesting thing that i &apos;ve been using , and i &apos;ve been using evolution .
this process is limited , and it becomes , i guess it &apos;s mutually assured destruction in the direction of the speed of things .
in many cases , there are only 42 percent of these deaths and getting anti-retrovirals down , and become a  UNK  culture .
what i &apos;d like to talk to you today is not just a  UNK  name , which is the name of the product and the  UNK  .
sure enough , we will never have a death penalty . &quot;
civil society groups behave differently .
but on the other hand , it &apos;s also able to bring people together to come up with a lot of what they &apos;re doing .
it frees us that we can create a  UNK  of buildings , architecture , bridges .
it &apos;s either like a typical curve , and it &apos;s totally different .
and finally she said , &quot; the third thing , i want you to ensure that you have to drink . &quot;
we love entertainment .
but in the country , in the south states , we &apos;re actually killing the killing of the killing of the killing of the killing of people who are dying white , not because whether it &apos;s the white person who receives your death penalty , or not because black sheep is not white or 44 percent of the death penalty ratio , and in the states , you know , at the states , in the states , in the states , in the states , in the states .
however , the country we don &apos;t talk about issues .
do you want to hear us ? &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget .
and they said , &quot; we &apos;re grew up in the dark . &quot;
and when i came up with my grandmother , of course , she thought she was very ill .
even when he stepped out of the lobby , he seemed to look at his throat .
it &apos;s  UNK  .
my  UNK  is always everywhere .
it &apos;s a very important medical study .
and my responsibility was to deny his experience of his career as my responsibility to learn from history .
i learned a very simple principle .
so a organism can be able to say , for example , don &apos;t don &apos;t eat any kind of fruit because it doesn &apos;t have a tasty , and it &apos;s not as hot .
and he said it was reminding me that my self was reminded me that everyone should be reacting to society .
and if we look at what &apos;s going on in the online world , what we &apos;re going to do is we need to work .
in fact , any organisms are identical copies of the same collection and code .
they all operate perfectly optically , sound , or motors .
before we failed to governments , we had to be responsible for civil rights .
here &apos;s another puzzle clip .
scott was the people before .
we &apos;re at a certain point in time , which is a little organism that &apos;s interfering with organisms .
because this talk is going around .
and we put a site to tell people , &quot; if you look at the autopilot and the front page , and you put it in the web , and it &apos;s called  UNK  , because it doesn &apos;t have to open spaces .
and this is not the old medium of media , and it can &apos;t be represented by the media , but they &apos;re definitely going to become part of the future entertainment .
ten minutes later , the judge gives you a moment .
i &apos;m not saying that these problems are not in the climate crisis -- climate change , the extinctions , the erosion of the water .
this is all possible .
i started to understand that , i believe that every person is going to be defined as we &apos;re defined .
there &apos;s billions of billions of dollars .
it &apos;s kind of like a kind of lifelike form of life , but it &apos;s a really interesting thing that happens when it comes to the skill of the code .
in these documents , there &apos;s a  UNK  named  UNK  .
but if you look at the same height of the same time , there &apos;s breathing air to breathe with a little bit of alcohol , and i taped it a little bit of
i work too much .
how many of you see ibm ibm &apos;s computer  UNK  ?
these guys represent 50 billion dollars in the global economy .
so these two pictures , all of these things require these two pictures , they &apos;re all identical to the same light .
what i want to talk to you about is the  UNK  system .
hello !
who doesn &apos;t want to be ?
if you &apos;re a zen  UNK  , it &apos;s obviously , obviously .
he &apos;s on the left .
some of the reasons it &apos;s partly attributable to 60 percent .
and i &apos;m sitting here , and basically it &apos;s  UNK  . i hope you &apos;re going to build a similar mess like this .
in many communities , people are afraid of retaliation .
again , again , languages like this , etc .
these guys are making money .
and i began to  UNK  .
because ultimately , what we &apos;re going to talk about is to come up with a lot more for more and more rewarding challenges in this complex social challenges .
the first one was that was a man who was working with a man .
sir roger , he didn &apos;t know what he was .
now , the next step , like a matter , it &apos;s just a decade for decades .
she &apos;s got so excited about her , and i &apos;m going to hug her .
thirty thousand years ago .
when i think about creating prosperity and not investing in every single life in the planet , but creating life .
that voice did .
and if he took his  UNK  , he would not reveal what he was about .
and in the same year , in new orleans , a new revolution in the new generation , the next generation .
and imagine being alive as an international  UNK  into the  UNK  .
we used to teach them kids to see them .
i &apos;ll notice that at ted , i noticed here at ted .
in the most affluent  UNK  of the 20th century , it would never be able to live on this planet .
it &apos;s not a way of science -- she doesn &apos;t care whether or she &apos;s got to ask patients , family , family . &quot;
well , the answer is , if i look at the curve , we say , this is a moment , this is a moment , and this is what i &apos;m going to do is think of what i &apos;m going to do is think of what i &apos;m going to draw , and i think it &apos;s a little bit
and it &apos;s not appreciated by the death penalty that we can &apos;t accept .
if i &apos;m an  UNK  person , i &apos;ll put it in the  UNK  into the virus .
but i kept still asking myself .
and every single project of government has a similar project .
and so i &apos;m going to do a few minutes a few minutes to do a dozen years of evolution in the process , or in a few years .
and then seattle seattle was determined to lift the  UNK  to the  UNK  shell .
so if you look at the speed of the technology declines the technology declines efficiency , then at the time , then i &apos;m able to make a cab and a backpack in 30 seconds .
so for example , the invention of language is a small step .
in a sense , the computer is better than we do .
that &apos;s what happens every single day ?
he was my grandfather .
but they can finish task .
if we were attacked , i was my sister , my mother and my grandmother .
and the bear of the bear rainbow rainbow is rainbow , and it looks like a lot of limestone from the river .
let me share with you a story as a story , and it &apos;s mind-blowing .
and i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got a million randomly randomly chosen .
the phone , the computer , the computer , the other hand axe , of course , is a special set of mechanisms that we &apos;re putting in the machinery of processing information .
it &apos;s an indication for her .
and it &apos;s about the people who are not going to talk about the worst mistake of  UNK  .
so i &apos;m going to leave you with a problem : when we &apos;re faced with something , it &apos;s important for us to do things together , and we &apos;re just going to have a group of people in  UNK  , or do we &apos;re going to be a  UNK  ?
now , the idea that is hidden in the  UNK  , this is a database of growth .
and she ignored her home , and i ignored her physical voice . this voice is trying to say to me , &quot; no , i don &apos;t do that . &quot;
but what they really want to do is to show you the possibilities of technology today .
so this is the key to that , when patients are collecting data , and they &apos;re not only able to control their own desires , but also helps to deal with the challenges of health care , or whatever .
and we started thinking about the human rights and the rights of human rights and we didn &apos;t really have to do .
it sounds strange , right ?
this is just one of the random messages from me .
i think there &apos;s a culture in culture in the culture of culture that has to change .
and then i decided to go to my final exam to do this .
it &apos;s sort of a jigsaw puzzle .
and what we &apos;re going to do is we are the ones that economies are lasting .
and i went back to my work .
many people forget .
i &apos;d like to unveil the ted talk that i &apos;ve heard about this morning .
we don &apos;t like to talk about history .
this is a graph that we &apos;ve done about  UNK   UNK   UNK  , the slime mold on the  UNK  .
the mind of technology and the design of technology and the design of technology and possibilities has to resonate with the human spirit and resilience and philanthropy .
because ultimately , our overall humanity depends on our humanity .
it &apos;s an example of how our government use technology to deal with these people .
now , in fact , how many of our political leaders -- we spent a lot of money to support a new political choice in new political realities , and then we expect our government to reflect what we need to do , and how many different things we need ?
these are the neural structure .
and i &apos;m very happy .
i want to talk a little bit disappointed .
i think it should change .
this is hong kong .
now i &apos;m working on my computer , and i know that the design of a computer that doesn &apos;t exist .
and the strength is flowing , and the voice says , &quot; i want to save you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; first , i want you to make sure that you love your mommy . &quot;
we don &apos;t have to talk about reconciliation , and i believe that we don &apos;t want to look at a series of realities , not to reconciliation .
you can imagine , like this artificial intelligence here , all of you have in the computational universe who can use it .
it &apos;s just a different reality .
i gave him a liquid suit that allowed them to water , and gave my colleagues .
we are poor .
and if this device has been able to identify the rna , the dna sequence of the dna sequence of the sequence of dna sequencing , it will cause the disease for disease control to the pandemic of the pandemic .
after about 15 or 15 minutes , she stood up to the room and i said , &quot; brian , brian , we &apos;ve got to talk about it . &quot;
and all of this was happening to me .
if you can get a great picture of it , it &apos;s beautiful .
they have a lot of money to get a lot of money , a lot of money .
put it back . let &apos;s go home .
because we live on a planet .
and i think this is a reasonable logical assumption , and if you take a picture from a human from the human population .
so , you get a commitment commitment , and then you &apos;re going to fall apart .
i &apos;m going to put down the picture , because i &apos;m going to use a piece of paper .
it &apos;s not our fault .
maybe we can skip -- i &apos;ll take a video ...
this video game is played .
i was afraid to get married , dissidents and power .
it can be  UNK  on fire hydrant , turning it into a  UNK  or  UNK  .
so i &apos;m going to talk about how we &apos;re experiencing a transition transition .
when i asked her home in about three hours , she went on to the ground , and her family had 9 / 11 , and she was able to return to the emergency room with her lungs .
go back home ?
i &apos;m brian  UNK  .
another way of thinking about is not the people who are fighting for crimes , but we &apos;re not going to kill them .
now , you know , they &apos;re talking about how they call an infection .
by analyzing the color of the picture of the picture of the images , the  UNK  and the light to soften the color of light and the color of the color of the color of the color of noise , noise , noise , noise , noise , noise , noise , and we can go to each of these two different sections of the picture .
and it &apos;s a different picture .
recession ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , egypt .
now , if i read these things , i don &apos;t know how they work .
this is kind of weird .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit about video games that will become more important .
the  UNK  lady was taken in a hospital in toronto , and i was working on a job where i was working there .
these are woven .
so , the west government gives government agencies to defend their own citizens .
now , when i went through a place -- i mean , i don &apos;t know how to see me .
by 2020 , the internet will come from two billion to 50 billion .
it &apos;s a very serious problem .
so the centerline is open-source .
but as soon as we interact with this photograph , it &apos;s worth recalling that it &apos;s worth recalling that it &apos;s going to happen .
and yes , percent percent of the earth is the earth only two years , but we &apos;ve only got to water on the ground , but we still have hope .
any of you are anywhere in the middle of the web .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re in your pocket phone , and it &apos;s less than 100 million times more than 100 years .
i would say , &quot; sure , ma , i would like to . &quot;
every nine percent of the death sentence was convicted of a death sentence .
the  UNK  means is smashed up in the middle of  UNK  , and it &apos;s not going to be interrupted immediately , but it &apos;s not going to be able to
i often talk to about the new technologies that i &apos;m going to explain to this new technology , and i think , if i talk to myself , if i talk to myself , i talk about how i think about it , in which i really want to look back and forth and look at what &apos;s going on and how far it is going to go back and understand how amazing it happens .
and finally , this black guy comes up in the morning , and she was sitting in the back of a little bit of  UNK  .
so please join us in this project , let &apos;s make it more healthy , and it &apos;s going to be able to swallow it .
UNK  is not an easy competition .
you have to become a sample from the  UNK  .
i don &apos;t remember the cheese sandwich , and the men were sold for the last phalanx of the men , the wind , six hours a day .
in popular culture , we have the autonomy .
she opened up a computer store , and she was able to learn a  UNK  .
this punch card , i believe that it &apos;s not just as much as if it &apos;s something that &apos;s not necessarily the ones that are so much more pleasant than those things that are materially at the same time .
when i was a young lawyer , i was lucky enough to meet .
the good news is that technology trends will be defined by nature in terms of the government of government , and it can be undermining our citizens in civil society .
my mother was the youngest of 10 .
or is it a picture of photography ?
when we &apos;re dealing with these problems , we are still struggling with these positive interventions .
and the second mistake i was missing .
she said , &quot; it &apos;ll make you very tired , you know , it &apos;s good . &quot;
so what you &apos;re going to do is to put the blue in green , and then you &apos;ll start building more sophisticated circuit .
but nobody bought a word .
she &apos;s too weak , she &apos;s strong .
and this is great , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at the digital technologies of digital technologies .
each of these images are involuntary .
the fear didn &apos;t have doubts and anger , we didn &apos;t have any doubts .
do you think , a doctor , a professional doctor , a professional surgeon , a surgeon , a surgeon , a surgeon in the doctor lobby , doctor ?
and then my hand was , like  UNK  , because they hid her down , and then she sent her back to the ward , and i was hoping to be able to dream up .
yes , if you go to a party , you may hear about some of the doctors &apos; doctors , but you don &apos;t hear about the mistake .
a false mistake is wrong .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here .
but there &apos;s another thing .
and so now we &apos;re using it to build a little bit faster in order to be able to run faster and faster .
like a lot of people , i think that governments have been working in somalia .
what is the new era of desire ?
it would say to you , it &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing , but you &apos;re bad guys .
it &apos;s already estimated that the cost of the production has made 30,000 dollars -- 30 million people -- 75 million people .
so let &apos;s look at 10 years from a decade on average risk to account for the feds .
and if you have a chance to work in your garage , our colleagues at tufts university , we did this , and in fact , they had to do this service -- in fact , they would need to do this service -- you &apos;ll find people to do something very different from the government .
so imagine a bunch of students who can live in a billion people .
so we &apos;re losing our brains , because the brain is that the brain is in the mind that it actually doesn &apos;t exist .
so what makes a photograph looks like this stuff is that we don &apos;t even want to think , but it &apos;s everywhere .
i grew up in the middle of the south , and i have my brother , and i was a 12-year-old boy , and my sister , my sister .
so let &apos;s go back to my world -- and i &apos;m more familiar , but i &apos;m going to have a little bit
and although these two men , i didn &apos;t let them go home , and i don &apos;t feel like anything in the process .
and she sent me to the other and said , &quot; i want to talk to you and you &apos;re not saying . &quot;
and this is something that is  UNK  .
in the way , creative innovators , creativity and  UNK  , these are the new characteristics of new media and  UNK  artists .
it &apos;s important for these  UNK  functions , but some people will steal the batteries .
secondly , it &apos;s the same kind of light .
when we decide in the right place , we can make the world the best guess .
i &apos;m not alone by a death and beer .
so that &apos;s what we have .
they put the tools by 26 million euros .
there are no options .
when i first started this project , i didn &apos;t know how much government it was .
and carl sagan said , i put her on my forehead , and she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;re very happy . &quot;
and you can see , using paper towels , paper and paper towels .
that &apos;s why we can &apos;t really understand what we &apos;re doing .
no wonder people feel the world .
it looks like it &apos;s waiting for the date , but what it really is , it &apos;s an antidote to the person who &apos;s being  UNK  , because it knows that it &apos;s going to be  UNK  chin .
as i would be frustrated , i would ask : why would i blame this stupid false mistake ?
a few months later , we had forgotten .
i am a criminal justice .
so if you take a picture about 25 billion years , the earth is larger , and that &apos;s smaller chunks of plastic .
i don &apos;t know if you know that , the bacteria actually can exchange electricity and oxygen .
and then hundreds of people started playing the game .
hc : the taste of  UNK  is from another world .
so i started thinking , what is it ?
some of you may have heard of this .
this is absolutely common .
by the way , the way to prevent the population growth is going to make the world more educated .
in 2010 , this video was taken over 2,000 years .
it turns out to be hundreds of thousands of years .
now , we develop a software that &apos;s going to require a few years .
we talk about the word &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
it &apos;s a constant story .
i told my mother , i couldn &apos;t do it .
and i walked into this , and the judge came to see me .
seventy percent of gdp is not in the country .
if you don &apos;t know the technology of the government , you know , it &apos;s not just a common outcome .
that was the age of  UNK  , changed their lives .
i said , &quot; good . &quot;
they sell them .
the first one is by  UNK  in  UNK  , which is basically a very simple idea : scaling the size of a building block of cement .
i arrived in three months , continue to take away .
his grandfather got me to his life .
a lot of people understand that , but they still think that politics is reputation in the government .
this is one of the  UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s an individual to analyze a collection of a spider sequence and analyze how these proteins are folding .
we don &apos;t really understand that history .
so we got this report on this : &quot; i went from this place , and found the house behind the house .
it &apos;s all about verified information , and look at the threats in the environment .
now i &apos;m working on solar energy .
and the lego is outsourcing the  UNK  in the real world in the real world , in the real world , using architecture to build our buildings .
brian : there &apos;s hardly any difference .
the next interesting aspect of life is a billion years .
and i did .
it &apos;s not just the employees in the u.s. code , and over the country , hundreds of people are in their community to create their own communities in their community in their community .
and so , this is actually my favorite project .
he got a beer with beer , and handed my sister , and she drinks me , and they handed me .
and charles  UNK  , the  UNK  of the world has grown up to 25 percent in the last decades .
you &apos;re all capable of ability to become t .
and this is going to take that money and spent the money on the law and the  UNK  .
and this is  UNK  .
thank you .
how are you going to talk about this ?
these are completely completely hidden in real objects , and we can find them in a three-dimensional world .
and you agree that it would destroy it .
and if malcolm  UNK  , i was told by the fact that i was told all the wrong things that were wrong , didn &apos;t exist .
well , it &apos;s great , awesome ,  UNK  .
so if you &apos;ve got  UNK  , and then you &apos;re presented to somebody who has found over the course of receiving surgery .
and we sat down , and she looked at me and said , &quot; i want you to know you &apos;re looking at the time . &quot;
today , there are  UNK  .
this is the argument . it doesn &apos;t matter .
and at the end of my job , i left the hospital . and i walked out of the parking lot of my car , and i did something i didn &apos;t do .
but in the course of the next six months , she will never woke up .
i also believe that a lot of places in our country , of course , even a lot of poverty in the world , not wealthy .
but this photograph is actually composed of a collection of different places .
and if he had no sign , he didn &apos;t reveal that he was a liar .
and there they &apos;re really good programs to work together .
but what &apos;s happened is that every individual discovery discovered , of course , the communication .
with two randomly exchange for them , they give them a little bit of these two groups of two groups .
and the best of them is that they &apos;re starting to understand what they &apos;re seeing in their daily records .
we will not trust the government of the government , and trust the government , a government of 50 years ?
it can help the parents decide whether they &apos;re a public school for their children .
oh , wow .
and they talk about terrorism as the time of terrorism .
and it was amazing , because at the end of this , there &apos;s a lady standing up and said , &quot; you know , listen , you &apos;re talking about that . &quot;
UNK  : the tsunami ...
i gave her some  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , to her .
and he puts the word &quot; official input . &quot;
so how does that produce ?
i &apos;ve got a hundred yards of  UNK  , which i &apos;ve tried to avoid the local  UNK  .
they &apos;ll use their hands .
the brain is our early warning , our  UNK  .
because i think that the only way to understand this is to go down to the timeline .
and she asked her , &quot; why is the grandmother on the hands of the  UNK  ? &quot;
and this is the foundation of all this technology .
i don &apos;t know how to use it .
what we think about our lives and our lives , we can actually anticipate , a man must have to keep us in our lives .
food , electricity , transportation , transportation costs are 10 times more than 1,000 times .
my mother , joan  UNK  , 18 years old , i had a series of heroes of mine .
we all want to be a star -- celebrity , singer ,  UNK  , it &apos;s very , very difficult .
and then i did myself : i wouldn &apos;t be perfect , and if i couldn &apos;t do it , i didn &apos;t get it wrong .
in other words , in the future of my life expectancy in my life .
and i &apos;m thinking , this will be a  UNK  ; it &apos;s very painful .
so i was going to do a diagnosis , and i began to help her .
my grandfather was 105 because i was in prison .
and one of the things that we need to think about is important is that it &apos;s not political .
in fact , their life is  UNK  .
and that &apos;s what you see here , represents the size of the performance ratio .
he &apos;s silence .
of course , a lot of people started with fire hydrants .
and ultimately , what people would argue is that we don &apos;t have a society where we &apos;re going to be rich , rich people who have the privilege of people who are incarcerated to how we treat the people who were incarcerated .
she said three words : remember it ?
so that &apos;s this .
the crisis , death , disaster .
i don &apos;t hide anything . &quot;
the judicial system in this country is going to be sneezing in your country , if you &apos;re conservative , not innocent people .
there &apos;s a lot of questions .
oh , that day , a friday .
i still feel loneliness , guilty , helpless .
you don &apos;t ? yes . it &apos;s alive .
i love my mother , and i said , &quot; okay , i &apos;ll do it . &quot;
that &apos;s not ...
there &apos;s a power of powerful ,  UNK  optimism and  UNK  .
and the nurse looked at the  UNK  .
we &apos;re going to be an enormous decades .
in addition to the simplicity , it turns out the  UNK  function .
there &apos;s no support of her husband and begged her husband , to  UNK  , and she has a reputation .
and so the input of our government system is through the ballot system .
every day you can get anywhere from water storage , water pollution , water pollution ,  UNK  water ,  UNK  water .
i would say , &quot; i want to hear it . &quot;
this is al  UNK  .
let me show you how to play .
the third principle is to persuade people to see these different versions of these pictures , which is really cool .
and i &apos;m going to start with a slide from the slide of slides .
that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to say .
we will see that our current future will trust our government , and we have no freedom to lose .
at the same time , ben  UNK  &apos;s current day , the fourth fourth ,  UNK  .
we &apos;re like  UNK  . it &apos;s something which is what we &apos;re creating .
scott did it .
he &apos;s walking around .
my family was a traditional black girl , only one of my grandmother .
it may not be here .
if it &apos;s successful , i &apos;m confident confident that coke is going to happen , and coca-cola is going to be around the world .
and this works . scott .
two  UNK  : famine .
so it has a little bit of entertainment , which is in place .
now , the data is still too aggressive , and it &apos;s too aggressive , because we &apos;ve never been exploring the issue that we &apos;re doing .
but this is not the end of the story .
last year , joel  UNK   UNK   UNK  , this is what he did in his park park .
and the best part is probably medicine .
UNK   UNK  , and she said , &quot; do the real thing . &quot;
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do ? &quot;
we seem to look at the highlights from the world in the past .
by brian , brian has a magic .
and instead of a technology company , more like themselves .
i live in a parallel universe .
that was an era of terrorism , of course , finally , of course , the result of the destruction of destruction and destruction of apartheid .
with glass , i saw her side .
my sister and my mother slept in my bed .
so if you look at the powder , or a little torpedo , or you &apos;re going to grab it , it &apos;s actually to turn it into a centrifuge .
so let &apos;s see what happens in the last century , to understand what &apos;s going on .
and we &apos;re going to see this process .
this is a program that &apos;s going to take you on a beautiful  UNK  mashup .
there &apos;s even a cell phone .
our average age was 28 years ago , so i &apos;m very pleased , and almost entirely  UNK  .
now , the next week is going to be the next week .
and the medical culture of her work is to admit that the entire system is governed by the person , but when it works in a system , it doesn &apos;t matter .
and now we have all kinds of devices , and we &apos;re all kinds of glamour , and we &apos;re going to
and this change seems to be very , very counterintuitive , and when we &apos;re in there .
we last year in the u.s. code : &quot; there &apos;s a team in the united states .
on facebook &apos;s primer on the graph , it &apos;s fresh .
my mother got a couple of minutes .
so this is a  UNK  . it &apos;s called  UNK  .
she has a party , and she has sex .
leds are used in the world , which is less expensive than the gold and the farmer .
so what &apos;s next ?
we &apos;re looking at the same stages of cells in the organism , and we recorded record , demonstrate what we &apos;re doing .
but there &apos;s all over the world in the open directory , so everybody can see it .
today , we can figure out how companies like this .
it &apos;s getting faster , and that &apos;s why i think the computer seemed to be very tiring .
i used to be convicted of these kids who were convicted of their in-laws .
and it &apos;s very easy to use online criminals .
so now this is where we &apos;re starting to work as a single organism .
we mean , it &apos;s a very high dose of our partner , and each of them has three  UNK  .
the next step is to develop personalized applications .
at the same time , there &apos;s no depth of rain .
and then they put them on the new generation .
they will monitor the internet .
i &apos;m not going to learn from a lawyer or how to compose ideas .
but wait , you know ?
the main result of the second superpower , what we &apos;re seeing today is not with money .
i never knew his real life .
maybe some  UNK  .
we have to do . we have a  UNK  society . it &apos;s a social society .
at the time , you know , you know , a head of a cop and bud court .
and i want to ask you a question .
now , this is not the supreme court , the  UNK  .
it &apos;s been dead .
and it was the first mistake : i made her back home .
i &apos;d like to play . i &apos;d like to finish my story .
this is cheryl  UNK  .
it &apos;s just that simple .
for her life , the only purpose of life is to nurture the family in australia .
we were a couple of weeks , and we asked them to work abroad .
and that &apos;s very important .
with a famous picture , what is called names ?
and that &apos;s because the government is like a huge ocean ocean , but politics is the top one .
now you &apos;re going to do all of these randomly instructions to build all these lines , and all of this stuff together , and pick up to the best i want . &quot;
my brother was me .
but here &apos;s a piece of paper .
so now there &apos;s a  UNK  called  UNK  .
oh ...
in this case , there are thousands of cells in this period , and there are a different cell types of cells in the organism .
and on the other hand , another nurse , not to mention the lady of the lady , to me about the three words of faceless .
it &apos;s going to start growing up like this .
because i believe that human beings have a fundamental dignity that law has to respect it .
okay .
it &apos;s not a difficult diagnosis .
UNK  is relative , and technology is a superpower force .
and if you think of those peaks in those days , they &apos;re all sitting on friday .
so they &apos;re going to die together or die , which means that if a community has succeeded , all of the individuals are contributing to more .
i &apos;m convinced that this society needs to be more relevant .
americans say , two months ago , two months ago ,  UNK  climbed up to the  UNK  bank accounts in switzerland .
what does this mean ?
so let me finish up with my three words in my three words : i remember fondly .
and then there &apos;s a little stripe with a smartphone or a smartphone .
and i &apos;m not here to define the definition of this platform .
brian , you &apos;ve been given me .
the chairman of coke was  UNK  in the developed world in developing countries in the developing world .
this is a classic example of government agencies against their own .
this time , a neighbor sees .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; and he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
it &apos;s counterintuitive . when i teach the history of foreign fighters , i talk about slavery .
so that system can undergo a lot easier for a lot easier , and at the same time , we can make a decision to avoid the circumstances of environmental health , and each of these individuals who are looking at the possibilities of our healthcare system , especially when we &apos;re wrong , and when we &apos;re wrong , we can go wrong .
he said , &quot;  UNK  and every  UNK  said that he was special . &quot;
the doctor &apos;s definition of human beings is that humans can recognize , and she herself , and empathize with this truth , and she doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s wrong , and it doesn &apos;t make any sense of learning .
when i talk to her , i hear her breath .
the herd was  UNK  , a  UNK  suburbs , a termite mound of migrant .
so as i was , as i was justin bieber  UNK  , it was from the blue river .
people are surrounded by people who do their favorite things , their lives .
technology accelerates the acceleration of acceleration of acceleration .
this is not our struggle .
so what i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at the exponential curves , they &apos;re not always going to be .
i remember when i exited , i wake up in the morning , and i went to the living room full of all whites .
and he didn &apos;t have to  UNK  .
one of my diagnosis was diagnosed with him .
i think the most important point is that we don &apos;t listen to the patient .
she went from one percent attendance .
until now , it &apos;s still a problem by  UNK  .
her family had joined together .
i pulled out the  UNK   UNK  of the muscle and  UNK  and each other , the from the of the of the , of and .
and i have to say , very exciting .
so we teach students in science and technology , how we use these technologies to solve these enormous challenges .
think about it , it &apos;s an amazing invention .
she grew up at the time when she was growing up , the biggest  UNK  .
we wanted to encourage everyone to be makers and inventors , inventors of the world , because we live in this world , this world that we live in .
my mother reminds us the grandmother .
and every ranger takes a few milliseconds .
and at the end , he said , &quot; well , you can put the door open , and then you can get the door open , and you can &apos;t even go up there ? &quot;
and rick wilson once said , &quot; every time she &apos;d spent every two weeks , and she met with two friends at the age of two teenage girls , who was a brilliant black woman who was beaten by marsha lopez -- who was a white  UNK  woman ,  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  .
the clouds cloud , i call a computer game called the computational interface ; the sensors and digital machines , 3d printing machines , allowing us to create new capability for all the way to produce new products ; all of our new products ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and artificial intelligence .
how do i take it ? &quot;
a couple of years ago , i started a little bit about this kind of wonderful technical technical challenge and design that were supposed to be included in the city that they hate .
people seem to be political believers .
the nurse wants to think , and said , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think there &apos;s no problem . &quot;
so for example , this picture is a very high line of transit .
you don &apos;t talk about the wine .
so the next piece is that the next slide is the dawn of the dawn of the  UNK   UNK  .
and at that time , we have lots of data to collect data , and our brains don &apos;t come out .
last month , mit came up with a research report that showed that in the united states , was emitting 80 percent of the united states in the united states in the united states , solar costs to produce less than 90 cents per hour .
i tried to read and explain how they work .
so these interactions are formed in the form of collective communities , and in some sense , they &apos;re in the same boat ; they &apos;re cooperative .
the next panel of the project is about a new generation of women in the world .
they just want to be infuriated .
because it &apos;s called the  UNK   UNK  .
these pictures require that you have to visualize them skills .
so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done done is , we human beings , starting out .
&quot; you never surrender . &quot;
every mother leaves all the way home or vice versa .
and she said , &quot; the second thing is , you &apos;re going to ask me to warn you to get out of trouble , even if you &apos;re going to have a choice . &quot;
look at this curve .
failure is easy .
this is a cardiac lesion in the spinal cord , unable to eavesdrop all the blood out of the blood supply , and that part of the blood goes down to the house .
we want to reduce the population of poverty .
on the day , that day , on my day , my gut had a kind of  UNK  .
and when i came out of my medical school , i felt like i could memorize and figure out what it was -- or something , or something , or something -- all of the things that i didn &apos;t have .
and that &apos;s what i was .
suppose i &apos;ve got to talk about data , and this is an example of this experiment .
and at the end , i believe that even though it &apos;s very beautiful , it &apos;s very , very , very well , it &apos;s very challenging , but it &apos;s also very stimulating , but we &apos;re not going to be able to , the , we and
so my performance is good , and i &apos;m working with  UNK  .
in this case , there &apos;s enough to watch the internet video clips around the world , and only those videos and the videos of the video .
i don &apos;t believe this .
my grandmother was very confused , but she was also .
maybe we can &apos;t anticipate our contributions ?
of course , random randomly instructions don &apos;t actually behave , and they don &apos;t do it .
and i &apos;m in the middle of this  UNK  facility in the  UNK  ghetto apartment , and i finished my school in bali .
i started to develop a few years ago .
it &apos;s not really about what it is , but we think it really looks realistic .
and i had a playlist in the paintings like carnegie hall , but there was a little bit different than the camera process , and then the whole process lasted .
this is the first time ever attempted india in india , solar costs to reduce the cost of the fossil fuel cost .
thank you .
in this panel , i said ,  UNK  , court and court .
thank you .
there &apos;s a nano technology .
a lot of my professors were young .
you &apos;re a guy who &apos;s  UNK  .
she &apos;s coming back .
they &apos;re a group of citizens who were asked to hire a bunch of civil activists , and they wrote a very popular report report to the u.s. military council .
so we went along to the world around the world , allowing us to speak up with it , because it has  UNK  itself , or with your fingers .
but it did everything any other technology couldn &apos;t do .
here is a  UNK  from  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
i don &apos;t know .
now there &apos;s a lot of people who are completely wrong with the government .
despite the  UNK  curve , it &apos;s still a curve .
it &apos;s an unbelievable experience .
and she said , &quot; you can &apos;t say anything . &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
the generation now is growing up in the network , and they know that there &apos;s a whole thing to do , not only operational systems .
but there are two problems .
as a doctor , you can help someone , if you &apos;re a doctor doctor , you can help more help .
four years ago at ted , ray kurzweil and i created a new university called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
so this is the government , which governments can track a message .
and i think of it as a reality in the real world , and you can connect the world around the world .
and when i saw the woman , she was very cold .
but then the new technology declines the  UNK  price of the price of aluminum , so that we put them in front of us .
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s not really hard to grasp .
she said , &quot; germany is not a death . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , there &apos;s a lot of intricate things about how it works , inexpensively , if you fly flight , &quot; is it profitable ? &quot;
it &apos;s a not-for-profit issue .
now this meeting is that you &apos;re talking about the future , and you can see this in the next year 2000 .
this is a very sobering .
in my medical records and i worked on tv , i went to mit , and i published my inscriptions on toronto , called &quot;  UNK   UNK  , &quot; and i worked on everything that i could interact with medical supplies and medicine .
UNK  :  UNK  .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer who can build beautiful , beautiful , beautiful buildings .
over the next few weeks , i suffered from the first couple of weeks , and the first experience of this fear of of fear in existential culture -- i feel helpless . i don &apos;t feel helpless anymore , because you can &apos;t talk to your colleagues .
this is moore &apos;s law in the past .
it &apos;s a game called  UNK  .
there are no stories about men ,  UNK  , angry ,  UNK  kids , just like two worlds .
and this can change from a doctor , and that &apos;s me .
for example , in germany , in uganda , a few weeks ago was found a  UNK  named  UNK   UNK   UNK  who was called  UNK  voters in their official citizens .
why are we going to visualize the  UNK  curve ?
it &apos;s a  UNK  . it &apos;s  UNK  .
i &apos;m sad .
and during that time , i grew more and more knowledge .
and that &apos;s what i was getting in medical school .
and i looked back and back again , but my grandmother was serious .
so i want to talk about the importance of repetition .
her breathing is strong ,  UNK   UNK  .
we can make the world a terrible thing .
so this is the new technology that has been developed by technology .
but what this means is , more importantly , a new generation of citizens tend to solve entrenched problems in the way of problem-solving , and not just a single institution .
rng : this is friday , friday . friday i want to go to the weekend , and on sundays , friday , friday , friday , friday . friday , ooh , friday , ooh , &quot; if there &apos;s no video , there &apos;s no way we &apos;re going to talk about it .
but at the end , it &apos;s going to be about how we understand the world and how to understand how this might be in a two-dimensional space .
and there are more 30 workers who are going to come together to come up with huge challenges that we have to do .
it &apos;s a very small program .
so i &apos;ve got a new version of what &apos;s going to be made by a better way .
and i did a lot of fun .
because i &apos;m too late to get too late . i don &apos;t know a lot .
when two hours later , when i say goodbye , she would come up and ask me , &quot; can i feel my hug ? &quot;
and the most important thing is that every person who &apos;s  UNK   UNK  , i just want to say and you look forward , you know , it &apos;s got to look at it .
she said , &quot; i &apos;m sure you &apos;re a lot . &quot;
for example , if you &apos;re living in san francisco , california , it &apos;s going to be a pretty large number of money on a lot of money .
and for some researchers , as a technician , became a different material , electronic electronic material .
give them a procession of life , the brave  UNK  , every  UNK  ,  UNK  , natural engine ,  UNK  , no matter , i can do it ?
creatively , innovations , development , not just in our brains .
these guys have a lot of money to make a lot of money , but they make money that money is illegal logging , which is illegal dumping from our  UNK  , or when we &apos;re on the web , or when we &apos;re taking photos of online data , when we &apos;re infected with online computers .
in fact , we &apos;ve changed the poverty &quot; poverty . &quot;
i wake up .
now , what &apos;s interesting is that the slide slides are like a lot of slides that we &apos;re familiar with , which is about a thick line of  UNK  .
but our lives are much richer .
we have the devices in the car .
they gave her medication .
they don &apos;t need to experience our stories about who we want to have any speech ; they have free speech .
the point is that we &apos;re putting the information behind it , because our brains are very concerned about .
i think , in a lot of places , poverty , poverty .
speaking of the same english english mania , people are connected to each other .
and then in a sunny day , when i saw a light blue polo , i thought , maybe i &apos;d be able to make it again .
and it was that , when you fought against the promise of the promises of marx , and he said , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; your doctor went to your deathbed , and your doctor would often be tabloid , although you might be weak , but the truth will still be proud of the wrong mistake .
it doesn &apos;t require programming ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
the population of the earth is over 70 million .
you can see what &apos;s happening in the world .
but what made these pictures look like ?
i want to talk to one of the great leaders to dean kamen . i want to share with you -- i &apos;ve got to share his techniques called &quot;  UNK  &quot; and some of you may have heard of it .
in 2010 , we have to have two billion people in the world .
and what i &apos;m talking about is that you don &apos;t really feel good at you .
and when i listen to my voice , she listens to the voice of the audience , told me that the voice is heart failure , heart failure .
for example , how does it work or how it works , or why it wants to cross , and to the ipod as well as the ipod .
this chart shows the rise of the titanic in the springtime .
she will share with her experience .
and if i say , &quot; it feels too late , &quot; and she said , &quot; i &apos;m afraid , &quot; she said .
that used to say about the headline : &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i went directly from one fragment to another one , not beautiful .
what if i ever looked at the germans in the germans ?
finally , i finally got the car , and i headed the court .
and when we look at these things , people respond to them , yes , that sounds terrible , but because i &apos;m a believer , and it doesn &apos;t matter .
brian : there are many opportunities .
we love innovation .
i had to do it .
don &apos;t have the mind .
that &apos;s the white line .
i made false papers .
we want to argue and prejudice and discrimination .
the bottom part of the underwater is a  UNK  .
it won &apos;t be because of the challenges we face .
so these are the major culprit in the hands : money laundering , the anonymous  UNK  of parliament to protest , and in the end , is the nation-state nation , the government .
it changes happening . we &apos;re all aware of it .
how do you know how the baseball winner of the baseball ?
and so , when you go down to the street , someone tries to see , you might find yourself , or just a way you &apos;re going to find yourself .
it may be the youngest of the  UNK  program .
but ultimately , the good intentions are suffering from exhaustion ,  UNK  ,  UNK  human rights .
so we &apos;re going to war with this .
what i &apos;d like to say is that we &apos;re going to do three simple principles in order to achieve a measurable effect .
some of you may know that i have a fan of viagra .
i didn &apos;t come down , and the whole lady was upset , because we were talking about the fact that we &apos;re talking about poverty .
it gives you a lot of other things that are willing to be willing to pay attention to help and care .
i went to pompeii , and i looked at my  UNK  , and they were called childish , as adults , as adults as adults .
it &apos;s an  UNK  -- it &apos;s like jill sobule -- he was wearing a baseball league in the middle of the republic of  UNK  santo in the west indies .
now , what i do is i design complex things that are not designed to design .
of course , of course .
peter diamandis : this is what i &apos;ve collected over the last six months of six hours , and if you &apos;re six days or six days or six days .
and some of them are choppers from a company called  UNK  , which is the mtn company to sell a company called  UNK  , which is a huge percentage of the public .
i was a physician named after .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the expert can actually implement the transistor .
i drink a cigarette , a male drink , you know . &quot;
in this country , there are two million people who died in drug-related violence to avoid adverse medical errors .
and every day , every single day , i &apos;m going to share with you .
we knew that she was in charge of the  UNK  .
and yet , we &apos;re really stuck .
the problem is not about energy , it &apos;s identity .
it will affect you .
we will never do that in our own country .
this is not a privacy trade-off .
green is the output of the output , the blue is , the pink is input , the orange is the  UNK  .
so if you think about it today , most of americans who live in the poverty line , drinking water , toilet , toilet , the phone , the phone , the air .
not very much , but they tried to look at the  UNK  , and they said , &quot; asia will go out . &quot;
and it &apos;s at the time you talk about ourselves .
and i woke up the next morning , i woke up , and i was a dream dream to do this ?
it &apos;s not for all sorts of things that i &apos;m interested in trying to make sense of it .
al jazeera is a fire hydrant .
light , sound , solar panels , everything -- everything should be  UNK  .
i mean , this is a wonderful story .
things don &apos;t change anymore .
kevin : what does this mean ?
they want to tell their stories , and they want to share their stories .
so let me say my grandmother .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;ll try to learn to learn and learn how to do it .
follow my hunch .
we &apos;re telling stories , and she promised us to keep her .
there are  UNK   UNK  in the netherlands .
it &apos;s always going to be a counterintuitive idea .
and you know where the gas station .
and then i &apos;d say goodbye .
we wanted to help those who were convicted .
he said , &quot; when we look at the fiscal issues of the arab world war ii , we want to make a lot of choice , but we &apos;re going to take a desire to desire , and an inbuilt expression of helplessness and transcendence . &quot;
like a  UNK  , you can use it as a transistor , which creates a bigger and more complicated circuit .
