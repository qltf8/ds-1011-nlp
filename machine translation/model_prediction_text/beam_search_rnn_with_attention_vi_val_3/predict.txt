now , to notice that these reefs are scattered ,  UNK  pounds .
i &apos;ve seen about afghanistan in afghanistan , and this is the most common often in the way , is the fact that most people into our success is a father who is the father of their values , and who is their daughters to be loyal .
i &apos;ll tell you why .
it &apos;s about the people around us around new ways .
but what i want to do here , we &apos;re going to do it for fun .
stalin &apos;s almost everywhere in the world , whether it &apos;s illegal illegal everywhere .
the first question : what is there ?
so there &apos;s a backup .
peter  UNK  was a professor professor before the work work with business , and this is peter  UNK   UNK  said , &quot; but it really doesn &apos;t fit in a society and a business economy . &quot;
but instead of asking them , none of them , we simply say , &quot; thank god thank you . &quot;
what you should do is to fight for your autonomy today .
and he said , &quot; well , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t look at something here . &quot;
in india , nepal , i was brought a hole .
if , after a interesting list of them , i still say , &quot; no , no , i want to become a  UNK  , &quot; i &apos;ll say , &quot; do your boss . &quot;
we victims victims to everybody .
after two hours , half of the sudden the unexpected end result at the end of the land , in front of the land , in front of the land , and in front of us , in front of us , in front of them , the ones that they reclaimed a football field , but they filled with prostitutes workers .
i &apos;m going to talk about that .
it takes a lot of time .
we are a team of  UNK  ,  UNK  the people from different lives , from every place in every city , and they everything completely , and everything we did .
now , this shows that every european company in europe , every household services on the ground ground , is to dissect a huge amount of information about people .
we started dating dating , and he loves me that i &apos;m smart , that i &apos;m going to graduate harvard , that i &apos;m grateful for girls and work .
there was no day i didn &apos;t think about amazing people who were  UNK  . i had a tremendous privilege to meet .
she described me a sense of how it was five , when i was standing there .
and i want to share some of the things that people write on that wall .
it &apos;s clear that you can talk about scientific problems that don &apos;t make ideas .
extraordinary .
like , like a million people like the united states , i lived in a  UNK  desert . in los angeles , next-door home went to  UNK  food and  UNK  .
the reason that is they &apos;re being infected , they &apos;re swimming , because there are voiceless with the people -- and the world . but the  UNK  community are using this toxic to use to new predators to see predators , but the  UNK  are the victim .
i went to color in the oven , i &apos;m going to take it down . let &apos;s see how it test it .
i could give them their worse in their current situation .
it &apos;s a restaurant .
and yelled , it was tuberculosis , but she was caught at the day at night .
&quot; i don &apos;t help her , &quot; he said .
and if i can just show you something to you and sam , and that &apos;s you don &apos;t have to be normal .
i don &apos;t care about the religious difference , and understand that : i haven &apos;t been lied .
driving driving on the street in the street corners , also the colleagues in the tunisian organization , a friend of hunters that taps it  UNK  up to the vehicle and we inserted into the lecture .
ah . he &apos;s ready .
i just changed what you thought about me for six seconds .
actually , the number of students ,  UNK  books and  UNK  .
but  UNK   UNK  said , we won &apos;t give you this information .
the  UNK  process of storing the things are not sustainable .
i grew up there . i raised my boys there .
UNK  is one of the most traumatized  UNK  .
thank you .
we are soil .
we have the local residents access to a tenth of one billion people on the planet .
even in order to korea , it &apos;s not easy , but i made a plan .
it &apos;s true in that corner , i remember feeling overwhelmed anxiety , and that moment , i just understand how hell it is .
on the globe , regardless of any time , our basic needs are the same , right ? &quot;
i &apos;m referring to myself today .
instead , this is the example of  UNK  brown &apos;s really understood . it shows the special structure of mine &apos;s  UNK  so that it was inspired by the unique  UNK  design .
i &apos;m learning from dr. philosophy at that time , trying to get away from the point of that sense of shame , and tell you what to do .
and you have to ask yourself yourself , &quot; if your father &apos;s more comfortable and more comfortable , i &apos;m happier ? &quot;
when i was going to leave my third birthday to my daughter , my wife said , &quot; why don &apos;t you take it to new york times a new york to a  UNK  and daughters , and then , &quot;
we met at the coffee table .
and it started the journey into the world .
i &apos;m using a heartbeat , in a fabric , and the crops and the trees are the ones that i &apos;m on .
my city went to me , and i was giving me a  UNK  , asked me to  UNK  the garden . that later became a  UNK  .
so i want to share the idea of the kind of interested in making forms .
a cell phone can change your life , and a cell phone gives you a personal freedom .
but it &apos;s been so with parkinson &apos;s disease and other metals disorder , they don &apos;t have biological metals , so there &apos;s no explanation that you can do , and the best that we have is this wiggle .
it &apos;s on the ground that we call the street .
this is your story .
and the trick here is the use of goat and easy to read that audience can be measured , if they &apos;re not  UNK  , and then use the expressions of sensory senses to help us understand the greater understanding of the comprehension .
i want to take a chapter .
there was another moment when i was at a mall in los angeles .
low-cost costs , and we all know what happens .
so they &apos;re on the street .
i fear that all those changes are not going to be more after the u.s. military .
the other day we woke up with news about the united states and the attack attacked the  UNK  .
and all over the world , every minute there is a few people who are diagnosed with autism , and even though it is one of the common developmental disorders in developing world in the world , we don &apos;t know whether or treatment .
because the last step in the khmer rouge  UNK  was killing him .
when i was working in this field , i brought together a lot of years , with the help of the divers , i communicate to the people that i wanted to match their stories and their circumstances , and when i was so i &apos;m safe to these pictures .
i tell people :  UNK  , my friends , friends and family , people who are unfamiliar , and i &apos;m here today because you &apos;re helping me .
i was a big dream , my family would have been greater .
cognition is awareness and the challenges , i mean , as many other women , ngos at the civil society of india , calls and resilient to democracy and democracy .
no .
if we created this material material , we can find solutions .
you know , your idea giving up your camera for a completely  UNK  alien world .
first , it &apos;s just like that , i call my wife and she calls me , and talk to each other times .
i heard the voice , but nearly one-fifth of them , and they were subjected to the ice .
i met him at the center of nonprofits that the taliban  UNK  the military worker .
the slavery for the service service for commercial , goods that the creator has value , the ones that they were missing .
amazingly , regime announced the cost of 13 billion dollars per year .
we need to cooperate with government in the region .
it &apos;s a good material , if we do the streets of the netherlands , very close to cities , we want a  UNK  path .
you can see every time my walk .
we see all the symptoms .
instead , as i said ,  UNK   UNK  : sea things can be better , but don &apos;t .
in 2009 , i lost my eyes .
i saw myself as a educational tool tool , a tool for the transformation of my life .
the cellulose is made of thermal cane , especially toxic gas .
as i started to start , imagine if all these people in the streets were in the streets near the year , a year in their pocket .
UNK  , michigan . henry ford .
the project that went to a week with a week , and several times we were caught .
the first time i had my apartment , my maternal credit card , and i had a big secret .
on the first weekend there , i went to a public health center in town .
this is not a church .
however ,  UNK  million people globally globally , and they have to live peacefully in  UNK  ,  UNK  , and  UNK  symptoms with this disease . but what we need is is the tools for outcomes to detect before .
they said , we don &apos;t want to translate this personal information .
and i said , &quot; yes .
hello . this is my mobile phone .
and i think this is just some of the drivers that helps us to open up the door and see the  UNK  of science and technology .
so what i did was in a food forest at home .
he wanted to know everything about my family and about my childhood , my hopes and dream .
now , the last thing i want to do is my new york and my career work , but i thought you &apos;re willing to sacrifice for your dinner , so i agree and  UNK  , and i &apos;m  UNK  the manhattan .
north korea are not so fortunate .
one of them is this .
when i was seven , i saw the first people in the first time in my life , but i still thinking about my life here .
well , dancing is one of those commonalities .
i also wondered , how did it work ?
UNK   UNK  with your  UNK  , ok ?
if the kids in the blink , they eat the weight .
we &apos;ve got a silver lining .
&quot; before i die , i want to be myself . &quot;
this is my response , took her three months before a few months .
you can get water on the gold medal .
more than 70 percent of the domestic domestic violence during pregnancy , after she left , because after that treatment is not mind-wandering .
sadly , varieties of parkinson &apos;s disease , like this disease , as something that happens to you to  UNK   UNK  , who used to be a professional artist .
when i went back to afghanistan , my grandfather was gripped by the family because he was rescued for his daughter , was one of the first people who were happy .
we didn &apos;t prioritize citizens .
how do you do it ? &quot; and i said , &quot; i did something very difficult .
the air is scattered and  UNK  hot , and it &apos;s very awkward .
with  UNK  and  UNK  , we attached to the voice the voice with a very large number of globe to collect enough data and starting to start four targets .
we did it in 300 communities around the world .
i was very  UNK  .
there &apos;s a slide like that , not so , but it &apos;s not too much dependent on a lot of the in the language of the brain , made us like  UNK  .
if it doesn &apos;t matter , but for your spouse and the face face , will never be able to be able to be able to fix it , only to put them together in a different light , and then the rest of the image .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to get  UNK  . &quot;
there are tens of thousands of birds around the world .
the strange was that i had to most of these places .
and when we do that , who knows ?
like this .
right now , you might think , &quot; oh , this is great , &quot; or , &quot; whoa , &quot; whoa , &quot; all of this time , &quot; all of this time , i &apos;m really talking about you .
after 33 years , i went back to libya , with a unique collaborator , i started grappling training classes to medical legislators , develop human leadership development .
until august , 2011 , i made my own new york city in new york city .
well , in addition to me , i can tell you that we &apos;ve created a material that used to steel steel steel , to make the use of mobility , to actually increase the lifespan of the menstrual , it &apos;s going to be more likely to increase the lifespan of life , even if the rest of life is the fact that even if you can do , increase twice as much as a very simple tool .
in the past decade , we have definitions that vulnerability is not only healthy and healthy and the richness that we &apos;re programmed for our desire to desire , but also  UNK  and  UNK  , and white performers .
but i was working with me to teach me to  UNK  everything , so i wanted to summarize with a equation .
you can &apos;t get worse than worse , and that &apos;s about charles darwin .
these guys have no idea , they  UNK  , they wanted to surrender , the women in between them and calls for each other , and the  UNK  it in the scene to help their contract to their broker , to show them their jobs , but to make their own work , and they &apos;re in charge .
because there &apos;s no idea that there &apos;s a whole raft of  UNK  for the  UNK  of wild dogs who are contracting , when you have  UNK  , you have a huge bomb  UNK  in  UNK  .
and i first saw the first day and saw the  UNK  , and then they went back , but the second day , and they said , &quot; it doesn &apos;t just stay there .
we &apos;ve got a great tomato sauce . in italy , a tomato is just about this size . in zambia , it &apos;s a video .
when i was a kid , i think that my money is the best country in the world , and i usually sing , &quot; we don &apos;t have to envy . &quot;
in fact , hopefully it &apos;s not so much like this .
he tried to improvise things , and started swearing .
so your wind up your hand , your wind up your phones on your phone !
i &apos;m doing miracles .
the next question i was asked to ask is : &quot; are you waiting for free ? &quot;
for her , after all of this , these pictures are a gift for the boy , something something that can actually look , so little bit of the past past 24 years ago , when the whole life was attacked .
at the time , i just thought i was going back to a long time .
it takes one hour . now it takes a week .
i went into the forces in outer and outside the order to call the day of saint and to start a contest against the  UNK  regime .
i know that we &apos;re going into a personal journey , but i was a little girl .
on the floor is the  UNK  of a woman &apos;s still wearing a boy who &apos;s still a child , and a child who just stare at her face her face .
thank you so much . thank you .
all of this information is stored at least six months , giving me two years by the house that you &apos;re using or or the internet service providers .
this is me in hollywood a few days before he photographed for french french .
it &apos;s a little bit of my hand and a dictionary , i told him to tell me the context of my family . there &apos;s a little bit of  UNK  , the man who went to me to pay me out of all the money to me , and my two brothers and sisters .
this is where i &apos;m in the right , the bats of the east coast , and the news news is , when you and i &apos;m talking to talk today , you have been reunited with my family , or more , my family has been used for the workforce and keep them secure .
i can feel the movement from the physical  UNK  , through the darkness , but there &apos;s no more visible .
we have a team of volunteers with  UNK   UNK  , they helped to find resources and human beings , and we discovered that the miracle is what you can challenge the culture and this part of the public health , by the way , the energy and imagination .
and so , scientists , scientists , engineers , when you do this equations , by the old age , let &apos;s talk to me  UNK  me .
of course people who are interested in doing this work , so we gave them for them , and sometimes they sometimes invited to work .
when the early started started , nine degrees , and there was a red night , they about 200 miles from the sea , and the book .
first , why do they get these bad guys ?
thank you .
and with the heart , i saw a chance that we could take care of their kids , and they have a sustainable life .
i remember once a mother and my daughter , i was about 10 : 30 and i was in my garden , and i went out and i went out and they were embarrassed .
but since i said , &quot; my daughter said , &quot; i heard hundreds of stories from men and women who had fled , who learned a life lesson from the things that happened , and those who made the life of life -- happiness , their wives -- the mothers , the mothers , the mothers , the mothers , the mothers , the mothers , the mothers , the mothers , the mothers , the mothers lived , unrelated , mothers lived , unrelated , mothers lived , unrelated , mothers lived , unrelated , mothers lived
because my family doesn &apos;t understand chinese , so i thought they would be arrested .
a lot of people are deceived by the  UNK  of good education , better , just to feel like they &apos;re arrested , don &apos;t work .
what is the nodes ? you see that in the street is bald .
my community , the  UNK  , believe that we went from the streets with all the animals and all of our land to keep them , and that &apos;s why we judge them .
it &apos;s like this beautiful form that goes into the world bank accounts of  UNK  .
where did you clap so much ?
you can imagine , the town were destroyed .
and the thing that it &apos;s in new york is the universities , because it decided to go to new york school .
UNK  schools ,  UNK  homes , ready for innovation and rehabilitation .
he didn &apos;t start alone .
i feel that it &apos;s easy to lie silently for days , and forget what really matters to you .
because there &apos;s no power ; you can be the editor of  UNK  in the united states or the ceo of the whaleship essex , or  UNK  .
now , all of these images have been done in the country , buried in the saltwater country , in magnesium , in the water , sometimes in the oil , sometimes during the time , while all the time they will continue to fail . so it &apos;s a very big part of the project .
you can &apos;t imagine how wonderful flowers are , and how they affect people .
and i realized : one of the most important things we &apos;ve created is memory .
thank you .
this has never been born .
one is that , as i , as i graduated , king graduated from school , and that he has worked at a very small bank on wall street .
almost 200 million organizations were installed in  UNK  during that time and shortly after  UNK  -- almost 300 feet in  UNK  .
a few days later , when driving driving home after  UNK  , he was tired of cars , and he threw his whole food bag on my face .
yeah .
UNK  is the symbol of  UNK  and his mother , and with  UNK   UNK  , and the symbol of  UNK  , they  UNK  the flower between the  UNK  &amp; amp ; amp ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt
i was expecting to think that i was the only case and i was alone in this .
i &apos;m talking about writing jobs for people , and pull out the kids out of the street , and they tell the joy of joy , the joy and the honor of honor is to for farmers .
the same group of women , i went to  UNK  women in libya , a peace of women &apos;s ministers , women from different parts of the society , to restore their commitment to society for women and women for their rights to be responsible for democracy and peaceful .
you don &apos;t have to design a whole new system system to do this trial .
and it doesn &apos;t disappear .
the interesting thing is that food is less efficient than killing people die .
when i met , he was doing 14 years in the open savanna , and the wound at the heart valve that you see here from a  UNK  accident , a foot of injuries left his hand .
and i started everything .
half a week , each one of them found that they had lived .
this is the life that it &apos;s the border between north korea and china .
they &apos;re  UNK  .
i find american americans see , vulnerability , in the changes .
when i sing these songs from my childhood , trying to remember the words that i can &apos;t , i call it to me that we know how to do that we know about how we brains about brains , and what we don &apos;t know how to do .
and this is the way i stayed in that land .
they &apos;re also connected to disney -- being  UNK  into  UNK  ,  UNK  , stupid .
so , guess what ?
when charles darwin went across the throne of the pacific pacific  UNK  from the  UNK  , he said , &quot; these birds worms are made of the head in toys .
so we can create a community where there are people who have the foundation with a small business memory , in the coffee , and some of you guys do for you to what they &apos;re talking about people who &apos;s talk to you , &quot; what do you need ? &quot;
when my question : why am i here ?
you have to give them a security , privacy , you have to really be excited to help them , and they will , i think , i think , i think i think , i think , i think i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think i think .
ask scientists and engineers ,  UNK   UNK  us .
i want them to know that we &apos;re going to do them for them , and we &apos;re going to do something to be able to help them change their lives .
think about the death of your life sucks .
could they steer our entire information ?
the time takes place away from the  UNK  is a completely different story , and it &apos;s clearly dependent on the ceo .
instead , i was a strong woman in love with a man who had a problem , and i was the only person on earth that could help us face the face of his cries .
we can also have a role like a bridge between those who are in north korea , because there &apos;s a lot of people in us with the other family members in the country , and we share with them information and teachers to change the north .
one of the most amazing things that  UNK  did , since the beginning , is to create a hallucination that i was a promise of a promise .
there &apos;s no technology to do that .
what we have to look at that is how we nurture , therapy , education , move and communicate for seven billion people .
we &apos;re working with local communities .
i &apos;m standing on this stage because i &apos;m beautiful , a white woman , and in the community , we call it a  UNK  girl .
a lot of women  UNK  up on the back in the back of the gold , and the through the  UNK  water fountain .
the other day we wake up with the  UNK  of the military candidates .
we can do this observation with high-speed frequency to get the data .
together , we can make our sleep to our sleep , and our family has become  UNK  and safety .
unfortunately , after you learn , you write  UNK  and once a few things , you can &apos;t say anything else , because if you say , if you want to be president of the president of your friends  UNK  : &quot; the next 20 years , &quot; people will look at the opposite .
they had nothing to compare .
we hid people in the wind , so that people would think we just go shopping .
and of course , everything in africa is good .
but you have to hold it .
the story starts when i went to new york city to go into a speech and my wife took a picture i was holding my daughter birthday for the first birthday boy .
i want to take off the call -- and let them turn into coffee for health .
i see that as a family is sleeping on the boat , two brothers , a couple of little painters , about it ?
maybe you all agree with me here is a beautiful way .
when this village , liberals ,  UNK   UNK  their homes .
this is a design projection for nations like china or iran .
they disintegrate the  UNK  .
and if you tear , biking , and over again , it &apos;s not nice .
we &apos;ve been lucky with a foot of applause .
and my second idea was to use  UNK  .
it says that she finds her out of her intestine when she saw it in the first time , the first nine years ago .
the air is very happy , and they share stories of their movement that affects their mothers and they used in their mothers with their mothers , and she was amazing to see this idea that changed their ideas changed .
so we didn &apos;t know how we would change our lives .
so i had a idea .
i &apos;m always being welcomed by the big trees , the  UNK  up , and the comrades and the comrades for hundreds of years , and i believe in the city that always creates for music .
okay , can you sell it ? you can manage money ?
so what i want to propose to you is a traditional way that we can achieve this , because as you can see , at least a certain direction , we are all the masters of  UNK   UNK  .
when i &apos;m preparing for this talk , i discovered that the 53 percent of the girls don &apos;t like my body , and that number one to 78 percent when they &apos;re 17 .
with a cell phone , you can record the image of human rights action in syria .
a third of american women spend domestic domestic violence , has been  UNK  in some of their lifetime and the cdc report to show that 15 million children are infected every year , 15 million .
so what happened ? in 40 years , i was in 1900 , in the u.s. , there were about  UNK  companies called  UNK  .
photography was my passion since i was enough to hold a camera , but i &apos;d like to share with you the next 15 minutes that i value , and i didn &apos;t .
i teamed up with my group , and the green underground bunkers , we went back and started in the forest forest : plants eat vegetables , you know , refrigerators .
it &apos;s around us . we can &apos;t see .
do they get caught ?
but this sound can actually be really hard , in some cases , but with any physical , artificial intelligence , and using software analysis , which is the current current current system that we can guarantee people who can guarantee the person in the interconnection of health and disease just by using the voice .
how do they don &apos;t agree ?
you just encounter a group of aluminum models , because they have the most  UNK  their  UNK  , and the most beautiful  UNK  , and they can be the youngest female believers on the planet .
for the past four decades , the  UNK  of the pesticide has destroyed the infrastructure and the social embodiment of the libya .
in china , the life of a girl has been stripped from a family like a very difficult place .
israeli soldiers must revive their identity and struggle to stay through a tragedy .
after a while later , one of the police said to the other , this is a false correlation .
let &apos;s go back to that time , at the city .
it &apos;s not that time that i realized that these pictures are just a very important part of these people .
but today , over three million girls are in afghanistan in afghanistan .
but today , a family generation has been  UNK  by a number of generations to just for it .
so we &apos;re  UNK  , put a lot of pressure on it , picks them a magnetic pulse , and they try and get them again .
and my first answer is , &quot; just don &apos;t you know , it &apos;s not illegal . &quot;
autonomy and living in the era of digital technology isn &apos;t conflicting .
but nobody has to help them , because it &apos;s all about their necks and family .
cities has some of the most innovative architecture in the world , but it also has the largest number of  UNK  symptoms .
after the end , after a journey that i was reunited with south korea , but it came to the freedom of freedom that was a half of the struggle .
in fact , they &apos;re the first person , and the courage to convince the future of their daughters , but in social situations like afghanistan , we need to support the support of men .
in november of 2011 , the tracking observation in the home , i saw the tragic events in japan .
he was not just about my diploma , but i was the first woman , and i was the first woman who could give him him in the streets of kabul .
and i was stuck in the reading when i read books , &quot; beautiful movies , &quot; written by  UNK  , saying , all of all faiths , in the economic growth , if they don &apos;t need help , or  UNK  them .
but that information is not just about me .
who sent out the news messages ?
i &apos;m very fortunate to be taught in a very busy family of honor and girls .
since i was a little kid , i was working in my room with my entire day , and i was even made my radio radio my mom , and that night was killed me , but i learned a lot about it .
the next question that people always ask me is , &quot; can you become a model when i was a big deal ? &quot;
there were also the copies of his photograph .
i had to rely on the slaves who worked in the system to liberate them , and i believe them .
so what i &apos;m doing in the first year in  UNK  is just  UNK  in the street , and in three days i &apos;ve got a very first time to a guy who &apos;s heard a guy in a garage , called  UNK  , and i helped him you to give you a restaurant in the  UNK  , and the u.k. organization , and then a  UNK   UNK  , and then a  UNK   UNK  , and then a  UNK   UNK  , and then a  UNK   UNK  , and then a  UNK   UNK  , and then a  UNK   UNK  ,
then you have to bring them a  UNK  service , isolated and  UNK  .
because the truth is that i was a typical victim of violence in the end of the same time , i was a  UNK  survivor .
so what i did , and what i did about my life -- my life -- was made in the seven years in africa .
the book was published in 2009 .
they &apos;re  UNK  , and our narrative , is the last thing we &apos;re  UNK  and also the first thing that we first step back into heart .
there &apos;s no  UNK  .
i &apos;m 22 years old , living in the united states , women who are 16 and girls from 16 to the age of 24 employees , who became the victim of the domestic violence of female women , and on the age of women , and over the age of girls who are killed every year by  UNK  , and , in the u.s.
and then , at the end of this  UNK  , and she said , &quot; this is the way , go . &quot; go . &quot; go . &quot; go . &quot; go . &quot; go . &quot;
&quot; &apos; &quot; i &apos;m the north . &quot;
so in  UNK  , they saw this  UNK  technology that made in life in new york city .
i never forget my grandmother  UNK  -- she died in her lower , &quot; hey , or  UNK  .
there are two types of  UNK  on the planet .
a million people in every single one another , which is why they &apos;re very different  UNK  .
and in europe , the people stood up and said , &quot; we don &apos;t want to like that . &quot;
there &apos;s a tremendous pleasure of beauty that the difference between us , and we &apos;re different things that we don &apos;t mean that there &apos;s something wrong .
what &apos;s the next invention of your list ?
i realized that was a very different kind of profound life in my life .
kenya , the world , will be poorer , if any of these animals are not .
i met these boys at the time , when they were throwing their homes , but they did something from the morning .
and yet , of course , could be a problem , but we have a solution .
it &apos;s only what i feel when i exchange with students , and i &apos;m interested in their ideas , and i want other people who are experiencing .
but then i realized that the fire doesn &apos;t really work , because it even had the lions to see lions .
i mean , no , why not ?
that &apos;s a real  UNK  .
nine , nine , nine dollars .
so the astronomers knit together and they &apos;re going to see what they call a difference , so they give it to the outskirts of  UNK  , like that &apos;s going to be solved in the middle of the city .
they wrote their lives like people happy , cute to the future .
we &apos;re at the final stage of the first industrial revolution -- with the fuel fuel , so that we can &apos;t replicate , and burning , we have corporates systems .
if you don &apos;t want to do , well , how do you do ?
some people say i &apos;m home .
you don &apos;t have the wrong opportunity .
let &apos;s say that i &apos;m normal .
no one knows what we did .
i can imagine that i would have far away from the next 14 years .
and when you show , don &apos;t use  UNK  .
it takes 20 months .
can you imagine a native 400,000 ghetto , with smart intelligence ?
i had a bachelor &apos;s english class at harvard university , and the business executive marketing  UNK  business .
and every day , every day we woke up with the rules of the armed forces and the  UNK  of the people in the rights as well as individuals to respect the rules in their laws .
&quot; just the way to save lives from hunger . &quot;
in the taliban , i remember that there were moments when i was so disappointing in my life and always fears and not see the future .
and in the meantime , this little abnormal damage is causing a lot of damage .
but what you do is  UNK  hamburger , you do plastics plastic , and plastic  UNK  will be  UNK  into this little  UNK  , and the soldiers won the back .
but instead , we kill the first everything that we did .
knowing the early lines of the violence and the virtues of conscience , down it down , just for the victims of safety .
we don &apos;t stand in people around , so there &apos;s a lot of emissions where we don &apos;t know , even if we also share public spaces .
fast pace , it takes only 30 seconds .
and yes , it &apos;s almost like all of the photos are all counted , but it &apos;s just a small element of what &apos;s going on .
so , the first thing i want to talk to you is that the family violence with all sorts of people , every religion , every level of income and education .
and of course , except for surgery , or  UNK  , i &apos;m a bit of sleep that i have two weeks before photography , to be very few things that we can do to change their appearance , and their little bit , even though it &apos;s hard and even change , it has a huge impact on our lives .
the first idea that i had was a fire , because i was  UNK  lions .
&quot; oh , no , i can &apos;t do this . &quot; do you want me to somebody else ? &quot;
our space can be better than what &apos;s happening to what we are as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share hope , fears and narratives , around us , not only can help us better life better .
then , &quot;  UNK  , &quot; it &apos;s known to be known for the traditional tradition of san suu kyi , &quot;  UNK  , &quot;  UNK  -- expression for humanity -- and the women , every single woman , born .
this is one of my father killed in the evening , and when i wake up in the morning i found it , dead , and i felt very sad , because that was the only father that we had .
it &apos;s less than a little bit more fluid in the center .
there &apos;s a problem in the community meetings .
how would i be if somebody stood up and ask her life ?
and if you don &apos;t trust me , ask people to bring the information that they &apos;ve analyzed .
i want to talk to you about a very special animal group .
their  UNK  their story .
so we can get help from the international community for education , education , english , and other areas .
so -- the state said to me , &quot; shake me . &quot;
but it &apos;s not about ourselves . they &apos;re about people , people , like , you know , you know , you know , all , you know , they &apos;re all compassionate to each other , honor and respect for each other .
same like a artist , the audience for the walls , i i &apos;m involved in ireland ,  UNK  .
&quot; when i work , i can &apos;t think of all the  UNK  and the songs in the pictures .
and i thought about dying , and it disturbed me , but it disturbed me for the time that i had , and made a clear thing for my life now .
i truly believe , if we look at other people like the owners , then it &apos;s very difficult to  UNK  criminal crime .
but i &apos;m going to turn my memory back , but what i taught me about personality , storytelling and love and i realized that these are the things that i would not make it to normal .
xenophobia doesn &apos;t matter ,  UNK  and conservatives become a symbol of time .
that means it can be done .
a new york like a parent for a corporation for business , health care for business money , who sat with you in your house , at the  UNK  table , in the coffee table , and helps you to find the resources in your life into a life .
because , you see , it &apos;s just a few we feed the animals .
because  UNK  doesn &apos;t sustain environmental environments .
wrong . they were marginalized .
which is , &quot; how am i going to be times and when ? &quot;
children were hunted from the family , and illegal , and being arrested in the way they thought it on their boats , whether they don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know how you are , but in any of these pictures , i don &apos;t appear to do in my family .
my new school is now starting to help and raise awareness .
and finally , our setup has been manipulated and successful .
the next step in this violence is to put the violence against violence and see how to react .
i was when i saw this happen .
and there &apos;s writing writing , when you can read these recordings , then your family family has no longer over there , because the house has nothing to eat in two weeks .
but then i said , i wanted to get this information , because they were my life .
i started as a pilot in  UNK  , australia .
governments ? forget !
and on the cds plate , what i needed was inscribed .
they know that their pattern will be seen , but as you .
in fact , a lot of possibilities of this muscle will look like this person ,  UNK  tuberculosis and  UNK  in the next few years .
and then the lion fell into the tanks .
it &apos;s like , it &apos;s not his name name , and i can &apos;t miss his eyes , but that &apos;s his father &apos;s father &apos;s father &apos;s father .
together , we have shown our public spaces where we can have the opportunity to get a chance to have a voice and share more than someone else .
i saw young people who wanted to work , but they were forced to you something -- i see these kids , and i just showed these kids , and they just went to the path that were made , without harming me .
the secret is that this gun was filled with san  UNK  -- a man who went into my head , because the man i thought was a partner , again , and over again .
almost two years ago that when the  UNK  in the  UNK  it arrives , was made by the constraints of the constraints that were coming out in the  UNK  from tunisia and egypt .
i can &apos;t tell you about how i &apos;m descended from north korea can only say that in the  UNK  years of famine , until i &apos;ve been sent to china to people to live with a stranger .
i &apos;m here to admit that we had the wrong choice .
i realized that i was very lucky to change what you think about about 10 seconds .
they want to be able to our lives in our lives , and therefore that they want to intercept this information at every time .
we need you to understand the secret of violence .
i said we invented a  UNK  industry in the lab . let &apos;s cook the blood .
despite the things that happened , i &apos;m sure to be happy , because i love him and he loves me .
they owned 42 ft .
below the impact on weather , radiation , the oxygen of chemicals , chop suey ,  UNK   UNK  , they  UNK  the flower between the  UNK  , and if the flower , it will have a little bit of little blobs , and if you get rid of them .
everywhere they have lived in place , where women , women , girls and girls , some of seven boys , are forced to cook their customers , whether they bought a food and food .
so over the past several years , i &apos;m trying to make a lot more people to share with my neighbors in public spaces , using simple tools like shoes and paper .
they kill us .
it has a very powerful force , but it &apos;s also a fake .
we &apos;ll have paradise in your streets , you shoot .
the idea looking for a different technology that was entirely on all over there , and there were a very beautiful factory .
if you &apos;re standing here at the bottom , it &apos;s like a fantastic user interface , and when the customer says , &quot; cameron , we want this image , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
he looked at me , but fortunately , i &apos;m afraid to believe me .
they &apos;ve been collecting and  UNK  them to  UNK  in places around  UNK  .
thank you .
so i &apos;ve got this wishbone brown  UNK  with a cd on the inside .
he told me about two things .
i discovered that lions are moving .
but what if any patient can do this test ?
but what &apos;s going to forever life is that it is , and if we &apos;ve had to have to have to have to tell you to pay fee , we will do that .
i want to announce that you know why ?
when you get these pictures from us , we share a little bit of your story .
i had the opportunity to go to the airplane by the first time to participate in ted .
they &apos;re really  UNK  .
first , you have to bring them to security .
but the most precious thing to me in the first of the first met is he is smart , and he looks like a farmer .
my mother had become a teacher .
but if we don &apos;t change the component of soil , we don &apos;t never do that .
the first principle of aid is respect .
so i wrote the silence of silence .
we were so scared , but we still wanted to school .
maybe it &apos;s going to be a  UNK  washington  UNK  .
it &apos;s the fact of someone who says , &quot; this is her her intestine , &quot; as the victim victim , as a parent that weakens us hostage to us .
the cause is that the summer of 2006 , the european commission was a official official .
and at that time , a man asked me , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
but these  UNK  are actually a tribute to me , and even though he &apos;s not getting my arm about me , but my life is in a dangerous situation .
you have the power to finish the cost of a simple iceberg .
our societies need a national dialogue , and the more resources have a need to need elections , just increased growth and  UNK  .
and he said , &quot; if you want to kill me , but i &apos;m not going to destroy the future of my daughter &apos;s wallet .
the invention of my wish , i wanted to make a  UNK  nuts ?
don &apos;t just say that the research is coming down , and let &apos;s say you &apos;re looking down into it , it &apos;s like a grid that allows us to know how we need to know how to you need to understand how you need to know how you need to know about how you need to know about how you need to know about how you need to know about how you need to know how to do is , and the treatment .
so the green land remain continued to about 20  UNK  .
tens of thousands of people who were formerly  UNK  in agriculture , in restaurants ,  UNK   UNK  in the house , and on the long list .
it &apos;s not a north . &quot;
and let &apos;s turn it into your weapons .
how do we go and want a lot more things that we don &apos;t do with each other at the same time ?
you can see that  UNK  has a very close , so a couple of north koreans up to china .
the term starts us to understand his ideas .
that &apos;s why the next 10 years of the oil spill , i decided to go to korea , to start a life of each time again .
every pine is , i think , people are good , and we &apos;re doing good at africa .
these pictures are exhibited by her husband &apos;s found in a certain number , in the long distances of where she needed to be destroyed , and they realized him .
no , they &apos;re not going to be talking to you .
because elections don &apos;t peace , stability or security .
and , the thing that i love is is is that the animals are much more .
they were  UNK  with ancient culture .
in fact , my graduate student , i had to celebrate him , because he made a wonderful job , he managed to prove that this was able to work through the mobile phone , which allowed this project to be implemented , and that &apos;s exactly what was going to 99 percent .
it &apos;s happening everywhere .
we didn &apos;t work from our offices .
and actually , the conclusion that comes out of this research is that if we had four times the four years once -- again -- this is a huge version of a dozen version we &apos;ve made it to  UNK  -- if we had four years ago -- if we were four years ago , if we had four times a year , we could make it twice as much as the sun .
he had the big umbrella of this big team , the team of the big ones made the big flocks and  UNK   UNK  like ducks fire , and he would appear to be sweet .
i grew up in cambridge , and when it came , i went to the store , and i forgot that i &apos;d put my money for free .
i broke my mouth , and i listened to them . &quot;
i have triplets to the bathrooms and i have the  UNK  .
so i helped the  UNK  , the first school and the only place for girls in afghanistan , a country that is still dangerous for girls to school .
and you have to fight for it every day .
how can we make these  UNK  , do it happen over again ?
now , the  UNK  and the companies who want to get information about information is about us as much as much as much as possible , the online and outside .
we &apos;re really surprised by the native people , in guizhou , like this .
and i think that &apos;s why the lion in the national park is very few .
we happened to go back to new york a year later , so we decided to take a look like this .
you can become the president of the united states , or the inventor to create a internet , or a poet poet , you know , you know , you know , you know , you will be the first person to do that . &quot;
i saw the wheelchair was a  UNK  car .
so it &apos;s to say , for instance , storytelling , is that the way to do and make us happier things .
but the branches of them is that they latch up in fishing nets , and the kids who had  UNK  had been buried down to the  UNK  .
while i was very lucky because i was released so many of my people were not so .
these are the kind of need that a country has suffered a prisoner of war as a  UNK  , which can be peace .
i was so fortunate enough to get a lot of help and inspired by my entire life , so i wanted to be able to bring them to bring the country to the development of the international support .
that &apos;s the only way we can go to school .
every week , we installed our imaging devices in the library of the temporary england had taken a place before , so people to bring their photos .
i don &apos;t know what i expected to do with this experiment , but on the next day , the wall that was completely covered , and it &apos;s continued to grow .
it &apos;s emotional and i &apos;m coming . and before , i &apos;ve ever heard that i thought it came out of a framework , but only when i really experience it .
i &apos;m glad i had to think about my image every day .
in fact , 10 years .
on the tsunami , he was responsible for the axillary leg .
tom  UNK  : shake , by bringing all the colors for 10,000 people , how can you learn to be healthy and who ?
when i talk to you today , these people are still in deep , they &apos;re living in their lives without risking or not , or often die .
the worst part of this hand is through your head , because you laughed at the end of me , so exactly what do it on my head .
suddenly , i didn &apos;t have any country to be proud of my life .
and over time , a lot of machine , a lot of photos are uploaded to , , and we need to be the milk , and again , i went on facebook and  UNK  , in the next day , i found 80 people who wanted to help from 12 different countries .
but a lot of people died .
after the talk , i was overwhelmed and really embarrassing shame because of this ignorance in my life , and i thought , if i didn &apos;t know , how many people would not know ?
when i was at the age of the age , i decided to be just to people with people and i made a system called  UNK   UNK  , where you &apos;re never going to try to invent anything , you become something that you would never get people , but as a person who wants to want to become a better person .
i was scared .
even when they studied english and find a job , then their life can be completely  UNK  .
when the chinese police came up to them , and they came up with me and said to him , that this is the deaf that i was struggling with me .
i asked them to give me just a time , and i was expecting , but what i got was just a good answer . blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah .
this is where people  UNK  them , and that &apos;s kind of honor , because they trust me to give them my books .
&quot; before i die , i want to live outside . &quot;
since we started getting rid of the river .
she &apos;s up when my boat up close , old enough boats to get their little stickers .
a year ago , i was a boy in a  UNK  in my legs , and i used to see the planes airplanes , and i told myself that one day , i would be sitting inside it .
but lions are smart .
no words , &quot; and from &quot; we &quot; 32  UNK  . &quot;
less than six percent of women i learned in high school , and if my family didn &apos;t commit about my learning , i became one of them .
i was so heartening to see my students to my students to embrace this opportunity .
they will be  UNK  in the horse .
i don &apos;t know what happens during that time .
he took a tree in a  UNK  of our car .
they took a hole in big chunks , and they poured into the orange juice to their elbow , which was very toxic .
in west africa has a  UNK   UNK  to market for the market mayor and  UNK  .
and in the lab , we put through a lot of blood , and in the government , they &apos;ve actually seen the results , and they say , &quot; well , let &apos;s try to figure out . &quot;
there &apos;s a new group of experts to discuss the future of new york city .
but they can sell your car . so you &apos;re not happy with that .
i did all sorts of ways to give my family to reach the freedom , and they went to almost as successfully , but they were arrested , while we only had a  UNK  attack .
because if they saw something that doesn &apos;t naturally , i &apos;m going to be torn down into the water .
we started talking about slaves , and actually , i started to figure out that i knew that it exists in the world , but it didn &apos;t .
and these projects come from the questions asking me , like , what &apos;s my neighbor to pay for their apartments ?
our societies , democracy has become innovative , become more  UNK  and rock and ideological values , values , values , values , equality , that we &apos;ve been working at the beginning .
there &apos;s only one thing that all the world &apos;s most successful organization in the world is , there &apos;s only one thing : not a company that starts with one person .
UNK  taught information .
the heart is my art . i &apos;m in my work .
so right now , you &apos;re reusing using a brand that doesn &apos;t know that the smartest intellectuals believe in their work with their money ; their brand .
i thought , ooh , i feel very poor because they were there , and i said to them , two people know , don &apos;t have to do that .
and i thank him for his heart , and i said , &quot; why do you help me ? &quot;
i &apos;m just a woman who wanted to share my story .
we  UNK  , those who were happy .
150 years ago , a year 2000 , three hundred times a year old american ghetto .
the estimates that there are more than 400,000 children are doing it in their name , the largest  UNK  of the world .
in many weeks , volunteers and local people are looking for something .
my father was listening to the page of his little radio radio .
this drug was banned in india .
this is me in the same day as a photo .
the other question that people ask is , why is that no ?
thank you so much .
but this time , i &apos;d like to see the fact that the  UNK  is .
so i took a battery -- a car battery on a clock , and it &apos;s a little device that &apos;s found in a motorcycle , and it allows people to ask me if they want cheap or  UNK  .
and both both  UNK  . but one thing , trials based on voices where there is no expertise .
we see the voice , serenity and  UNK  .
we have eight species that appeared in kenya in kenya , which has six varieties compared to risk .
a guy who pricked a  UNK  from afghanistan in afghanistan , he  UNK  his daughter to his daughter , and his father was brought to school , and so his father was his father .
and animals eat wildebeests lions , and here &apos;s what leopard seals do .
the hands of bone is to be a father , the green palms , and that &apos;s his son .
i know that there are some of you who are going to be here tonight , and maybe some of these grandiose , like , &quot;  UNK  .  UNK   UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK  . &quot;  UNK
i have a lot of my  UNK  shoes that i never have , i &apos;m not exceptions , but things that i get is that i &apos;ve got out in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t want to mention .
more recently , if you &apos;re watching the news in kenya -- -- these are the characteristics of  UNK  that mimicked with  UNK  , but i want to admit that .
so today , for me , there is no fear of being true .
the neighbors , tell stories about this idea .
all that &apos;s completely possible with your mobile phone .
so even though we took the same photo , but our point of change , my daughter to the new rivers , and i was looking through life through her eyes , how it looked and interact with animals .
then you need a machine , as you can see here , the machine used to cook -- a  UNK  dryer .
you can be extraordinary .
what can you do ? do you do ?
i &apos;m here today talking about a question that the answer is  UNK  .
we could make a tough hurdle for the patient .
to change the community , you have to change the components of soil .
this is a way to investigate social media because you know who &apos;s talk to people , who you send emails , all that can be if you have access to information .
there &apos;s a great local woman who taught us .
now , i lived in new orleans , and i love the new orleans .
that &apos;s why the white guys in africa is called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; bees .
because we have autism autism , no matter , the difference between us -- we have a gift ! everyone &apos;s carrying a whole gift , and to say , pursuing the normal threshold is the greatest potential .
and if that happens , the collapse of the  UNK  in the cold war in the cold war .
thank you .
thank you .
i don &apos;t pretend to wind energy , but we need to work with government , because the wind engine makes these birds . they cut off .
this is a legacy that &apos;s been used for me , and that &apos;s a legacy that i made money to it .
i &apos;m not uncommon like a family worker .
i think what they want to be heard is , if you &apos;re a little bit more and a little bit more  UNK  , you will be happy and happy . &quot;
it &apos;s the meaning of this whole project , restoring the small pieces of humanity , the connections to connect to someone .
and i share it with a  UNK  way .
within two weeks , i had 150 people who wanted to participate .
this is the first eight .
but i &apos;m happy and i &apos;m glad i think it &apos;s a fortune to me 10 , 20 or 30 years of 30 years , and i &apos;ve been working with a lot of companies in my career , because when i won &apos;t tell you how i have the first job , or perhaps i won &apos;t tell you how i have the first job , or perhaps i &apos;m not going to tell you how i have the money , i think .
so in one night , i took a tree that walked around the ark , and that little girl didn &apos;t come .
i was there in a  UNK   UNK  in ghana in ghana .
the interesting thing about sustainability is that you have to sustain it .
so i grew up with lions .
thank you .
the idea that even even was called me and said that they were writing and liking what we were doing .
and it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s beautiful .
when i was 11 years old , i remember one morning i woke up my voice in my house .
i was shocked .
and i saw them that they were on the river .
max max : yes . what would happen is , when you call your heart disease .
and then a few friends you call me , they call each other .
my  UNK  team used to say : it &apos;s just a tattoo .
this is also the place where the u.k.
the day i looked at her photo was a day of her son &apos;s birthday .
that &apos;s a killer -- that &apos;s the united states today .
it was the deepest moment in my life .
you can even know where i was  UNK  by my head , and the frequency that i call the communication between those two places .
i don &apos;t want to play something like other kids , and in fact , i don &apos;t have any interest to me or anything else .
you &apos;ll be surprised to see how babies are affected .
thank you .
i was very comfortable at the time , and photography , i had to climb my back and his hand on his hair .
our societies need individuals who are more women than they need to be numbers and numbers of women .
so in order to make the first steps forward to us , we &apos;re setting up the lab &apos;s phone call .
if you tell me that the smart man , remarked , i mean , this useless , who made me right away from me whenever i was sick or not , but my life , how many of my friends and i was a place where i was , i was the job of my job , and i was a place where i was , i was the end of my job , and my head is the birthplace of christmas eve , or i &apos;m smiling , because there &apos;s no one of any traces of violence
india in the dark room , and where they &apos;re the sun .
why didn &apos;t i make it ? i could get rid of any time .
the  UNK  is the material that we used to be used to populate most of the  UNK  in the netherlands , it &apos;s  UNK  and water fountain , so you all have a traffic pathway , and you &apos;ll have a traffic street .
this is where i live . i lived in kenya in the u.k. national park .
there &apos;s a picture of a female generation of women in the house , from young men , and around the child , walked around a baby , went down to me , because my nieces , my mom , my mother , my mother , and my daughter daughters .
i went to a lot of villages in india , where families were killed in a fire .
sometimes they make the dishes .
no , no .
and he was incredibly  UNK  .
i lived in this house , and i think how i could make it became a better place for my neighborhood , and i thought about something that could change my life forever .
we took a bunch of samples from the street and we tried it in the lab .
because at that time , the federal constitutional bank has been assumed that the tasmanian devil has no effect in the nazi country .
not everybody has a chance to do this .
even though i had wondered , i didn &apos;t know what the outside world is , but i think i &apos;m going to live a whole life at  UNK  , until everything suddenly changed .
i was able to walk , because a  UNK  reactor last year .
and then , in addition to us , and after about a hour away from the woods , the  UNK  dip in the depths of the rain , so i started to shoot my head into the chest .
my dog was like a  UNK  , and i was  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
i feel like every time someone else &apos;s new zealand , new orleans .
it &apos;s about lightness and lightness , and remember that what the most meaningful to us when we grow up and change .
for the first time , i was driving to find a secret secret , and i was so paranoid , he made a head on my head , so i made my head into the  UNK  of the car .
if some women feel frightened when i showed you , you don &apos;t tell me right now , but then i &apos;ll be so close to twitter .
so i had this scholarship . yes .
i believe that you &apos;ll see a lot more than a million people in the world , the ted stage .
i led to my friends of my community , and we put the lights for the families that had access to it , and i teach them how to build them .
and from the sound , we &apos;re actually able to be able to get rid of the  UNK  where the forest is , when you &apos;re affected by parkinson &apos;s disease , and the sound reinforcement .
and as you can see , the solar panel to use the battery -- and the metals available for the clock box . i call it the production .
and what we do is to become a friend of each other , and figure out what someone wants to do .
now you may be wondering if it works .
thank you .
when the children fled , in order to keep their lives , they all crawl back , everything was left behind .
for me , it &apos;s the sad question and the worst moments , because we , but we don &apos;t know some things that you often don &apos;t know : it &apos;s a horrible danger to get something like this .
around the time that we focused on each other is that something that we value and to expect it for the next year .
the deluge of the world is found mainly in the united states , like  UNK   UNK  and  UNK   UNK  world peace , where there are 16 square meters that we have 11 levels of risk of risk .
this is one of my plans . this is what i want to do .
but there are also selection .
you know what ? i can be anyone .
but then i realized , this is my entire life .
they pasted me down to the  UNK  down a little bit ,  UNK  .
that would be  UNK  , and they &apos;re doing it right now .
never get a community with ideas , you &apos;re sitting with the u.k.
we cleaned up tons of  UNK  and  UNK  from local dialects .
and then you have to tell them the truth about business .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; okay , really ? &quot;
so what that means that people can -- people can call themselves from their mobile phone and test this testing , and those who can be calling their signature , their voices , and then they can examine their progress , see their health .
luckily i was in a different suit .
that &apos;s a school , more than 100 percent of us in a living room .
and i feel ashamed to see people who are close to me , and it &apos;s only more likely to add to the reason for me to do this . everybody asks me , &quot;  UNK  , are you not afraid to protect your food ? &quot;
in fact , and we said to people , &quot; people watch a  UNK  . &quot;
is a list of  UNK  and the distribution between the candidates for women and women who have peace and  UNK  ?
it doesn &apos;t work for yourself as well as the printing press .
so we have the lights attached to very small bits .
it &apos;s enough to stay in  UNK  million trees .
it &apos;s information about all of us .
less than a month , he and his daughter was on his way out to their village , and they were just watching a killed in a few minutes .
he sat next to me in the new york city , and he tapped me to me .
i didn &apos;t know if he was killing me .
we need to develop a  UNK  and a  UNK  that &apos;s not just admitting , but instead of course , instead of instead , instead of instead of competing , instead of  UNK  .
she had a clean long book , and before they realize it was more  UNK  .
so today i want to encourage all of you to be in your photo , and don &apos;t swear me to someone else , and asks , &quot; how do you take us ? &quot;
we also see the color here . it &apos;s quite gruesome .
i &apos;ve been a career working for the work of companies in the 500 of the  UNK  , like  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  washington .
and some people say , it sounds like garbage 2.0 .
so how did it ?
i won &apos;t tell you that damage damage .
perhaps ignorance is not about women &apos;s women , but it &apos;s women values , compassion ,  UNK  .
and he &apos;s also creating the  UNK  in the midst of belief that we made by his secret , that he was a kid from the age of four years old and his father by his departed , and his father surprised by his father , and the  UNK  that he hated his 20s , he was very intelligent and he took nearly 20 years to rebuild their lives .
this is the first commandment of aid aid .
there &apos;s not a big enough thing .
they had a long time ago .
so i &apos;m in a very good company .
i didn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
let &apos;s take it up .
when i wrote this speech , i felt really hard to find a really balanced balance , because on one hand , i feel so i &apos;m very comfortable comfortable to say , &quot; i get all these guys , because i get all these things that i was  UNK  , &quot; and it &apos;s really tiring to the next sentence , &quot; but it &apos;s really tiring to me , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t make me happy . &quot;
if they planted in tomato , they will eat tomatoes .
it was just  UNK  .
so we &apos;re taught to say , &quot; our tolerance win . &quot;
this is the family portrait .
and that &apos;s a great revolution .
i couldn &apos;t have what happened to the lives of a refugee camp from north korea , but i soon realized that it was very difficult , but incredibly dangerous , because the refugee refugees from north korea in china was considered to be mutilation .
well , i couldn &apos;t deny that there was a few moments moments in my family , but the moment i would like to feel like me .
now , you don &apos;t have to be satisfied with autism , but it &apos;s a brain quantum brain that affects the social interaction , learning and sometimes  UNK  .
and we helped them to understand knowledge , because none of the world can succeed themselves .
this little footprint on the road is its own .
there were men men , and they help me because of that truck .
two words from the latin word &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
it &apos;s like me , i wear a recipe for a cheap cafe , it &apos;s attached to a piece of paper , i &apos;m almost impossible to look at the symphonies of the caterpillars , and the  UNK  trees over the mediterranean , the hundreds of feet .
i didn &apos;t know that stage two was a  UNK  .
but let me see .
but most people don &apos;t agree .
during the past few years have had a huge improvement in treatment .
we &apos;ve got about 50 people who i participated , and it &apos;s all about .
the theme is the secret of violence , and the question i ask is that the question is always asking : why is there ?
so , in the future , whenever you use your phones , let you remind you that you have to fight for private self-interest .
what does the patent invent for the green revolution ? the universities ? forget !
i &apos;m a child &apos;s 1984 , and i live in the east city .
but i struggled to sustain this part of my life .
she had a bunch of cattle had been killed , and she asked me if i could help her  UNK  .
we did a study , and we looked at 100 companies around the world , carnegie hall ,  UNK  , shelter , all , new zealand , google , cigarettes .
i was so proud of my country .
we can do it again .
i was overwhelmed .
so this space  UNK  has become a  UNK  space , but the hope and dreams of people who made me to climb up , running tears , and they comfort me in my physical time .
why science is related to us .
i went back in the middle rooms and the police police , to find a way to find my family to get rid of them , but i didn &apos;t have enough money to pay bribes .
i think it &apos;s just being lied to land in africa , but then when i look at what the americans are doing , people who are doing , the french are doing , and after seeing what they do , i feel like a proud of my project at home .
i also took a huge distance between the south and north korea .
the next answer that i really want to tell you about girls is , &quot; why ? &quot;
my family is not poor , and i don &apos;t have never been hungry .
under the taliban , the girls to school hundreds of people , that &apos;s illegal .
the heat and dust spread around the camera that i can get hot air that you can &apos;t touch .
when something becomes a cheap , it &apos;s going to be widespread .
first of you get a rock , and more and more and more and more , more , more , more and more , and then -- i don &apos;t do that .
so we lived in zambia with the seeds from the u.k. at the great rift valley that goes down to the river , and we taught them to the people in the italian , and ...
you should look at a crap -- you should look at the  UNK  that we sell for people to eradicate .
you want to read your book , read &quot; the aid aid , &quot; written by  UNK   UNK  , a  UNK  economist .
and after a few months , i noticed that i was different .
i sold my friends with me .
we need to use to act like  UNK   UNK  , using  UNK  for  UNK  days .
i mean , i want to be as a monkey when i grew up as a kid when i grow up .
but in fact , i &apos;m saying that this is a graduate student graduate school .
that &apos;s a lot of them .
when i shake my hand , i remember a man who had ever woken up in front of a couple of  UNK  had gone down to russia .
thank you .
this piece of shoes and someone is saying , and we can see ourselves as the  UNK  dancer , because we have to incorporate all kinds of organs when you create sound , and we &apos;re actually trying to genes to do that , for example .
no one was rejected , and luckily she was convicted of her camera .
and i said , &quot; okay . bring me . &quot;
and as soon as i &apos;ve been told you here , i was told a horrible conviction .
UNK  by conserving and depressed , and yet , they went to work , and i went to 16 nights or 17 hours a day .
it explains why in  UNK   UNK  and  UNK  at the wall street , and his fabled future of what he meant to do with him .
this is the gateway object .
on january 13 , i found a  UNK  town .
that &apos;s my belief , when i tell people , or in prison for food .
when you go out of this room , you get the information about the birds , but tell your family , your kids , next-door neighbor .
thank you .
she was .
the first question is , how do i become a model ?
over the course of the norwegian volunteers has helped the fact for over 90 families , hundreds of pictures that are completely disconnected and corrections .
the instructor is saved from a  UNK  village .
scientist and engineers are the people who are dealing with the biggest challenges , and energy , and yet , if we don &apos;t know and don &apos;t understand that , it won &apos;t be done , and it &apos;s not going to do , and i believe our responsibilities , the people who are amateurs with them .
we are more  UNK  , the more beautiful leather , the visible things that can be possible , and always gets criticized in the press , but in fact we also have artists with careers and experience with images and photography .
opportunity opportunities for innovation and progress changes when we try to become like somebody else .
these people don &apos;t have any damage , when we talk about it difficult , that we know , slave , including slaves to fight that we are living in the place where we live .
recently , the new york times that gdp is to 100,000 children per child mortality .
and that &apos;s a little light bulb from a battery .
i got all sorts of things that i was going to remember , because i was somebody who i was , and because people were willing to spend more money for their appearance , not for whom they were .
why is it that we &apos;re going to be a society society and  UNK  by virtue of selfishness and prestige , by both sexes and females ?
i don &apos;t know how it was interesting to hear your story .
we all know that their daily risk of teachers themselves , students and their parents .
one morning i can &apos;t expect .
for me , afghanistan is a country of hope , the ability to limit , and every day of  UNK  schools reminded me about that .
if there &apos;s something that happens in this talk , i hope it &apos;s all of us to be more comfortable with the power of the perception of our experiences and failures .
UNK   UNK  attacked me last year .
they &apos;re all with this information .
thank you .
i went through a crisis of my origins .
the engine is not sustainable .
here we have a video of the rings of the islands .
the first thing i looked at it , and said , okay . it &apos;s a big data nerd .
because i can see where i went there , where i sleep every night , but what i did .
in fact , i became a model because i won the  UNK  awards , and i &apos;m a  UNK  , and you might be wondering what you have .
when we moved to new england -- you know , where the  UNK  rely on the  UNK  you can &apos;t  UNK  .
take it &quot;  UNK  &quot; wetsuit &quot; and &quot; the terminology &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot;  UNK  &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot;  UNK  &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and
and lastly , i had a deal with them .
there &apos;s a lot of shame .
we wanted to have autonomy in the digital age of digital technology , and we don &apos;t want to be that the local companies and suppliers the internet internet all all their information .
when your eye is  UNK  , it &apos;s pork chops , and it forced to be  UNK  in the grave .
in fact , most of them are taken by some of the  UNK  .
with a population of people , we can have about 200 clients .
so i installed light bulbs . you can see see the following , they &apos;re  UNK  lions .
they &apos;re not saying , but they &apos;re kind of joy in the way that even the best ones can &apos;t do .
l.d. is the united states of the united states about the  UNK  area of its own city .
richard  UNK  , which is different .
we &apos;re all north korea , but it became very different from the consequences of  UNK  .
and i &apos;m going to answer questions that people are always asking me , but with  UNK  .
and then the hudson city was texted , steve  UNK  wrote an article about it , and you with a  UNK  , and then one of the members of the green stripes , sending a petition on a petition .
we &apos;re  UNK  creatures .
back on the shock , i just wanted to cry , but you put it down to me and she said , &quot; ooh , yes , don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
and yet , it &apos;s a lot of noise .
the national parks is not  UNK  , in the southern southern southern southern southern southern southern southern southern southern southern southern southern the southern area , which means the wild birds like acid  UNK  out of the park .
i &apos;m here to tell you about the crazy love , a psychological  UNK  is  UNK  in love for millions of women and even some men have to have every year .
and this information is stored at least six months in europe , until two tons of years .
the sleeping room is also a dirty and the audience , and recognized , by the number of paint on the wall , by the  UNK  .
i mean , it took a long way to a child .
22 years old ,  UNK  and very handsome .
thank you .
it &apos;s a photo array , and it used to be created by a group of experts , the  UNK  , and the builders and all the  UNK  and all the  UNK  of them , the production , and the production , the production of production , the production of production , and they produce this , and they produce it . that &apos;s not .
for him , the kids don &apos;t learn to be more dangerous .
i was scared of lions , but now because my invention is saving the left of lions and lions , we could live with the lions without any conflict .
they were lawyers , journalists and  UNK  , all all said , &quot; we don &apos;t want to like that . &quot;
he was a very young woman , which was very unusual because of the news that made him more .
because that &apos;s the first time i know that my people are suffering .
when i look through photos , there are some pictures have over a hundred years ago , some of them are still in the envelope of the  UNK  . i think , is a friend who i can milk and remove it , and i know , hundreds of other people can do it .
in  UNK  , i was made by the women who was slavery .
and they gave us a passage of  UNK  ,  UNK  meters of  UNK  , and here we had to build a new pattern testing .
thank you .
this is a photo image from southern california to work together .
the same thing that i feel tired of that to bed for 45 minutes just to buy a lawsuit .
we have a sense of the stereotypes about victims like false voices , women women themselves , but it &apos;s hurt .
the fiber of the day today is by telling you about it with your kids , your colleagues , friends and your family .
we used to think about the  UNK  of sex when she heard the word &quot;  UNK  , and because of this perception , i &apos;m sure that it &apos;s very hard to be safe to work in this  UNK  industry .
i can finish my crazy love by drawing silence .
and in korean korea , english is so important , so i started to learn english language , my grandmother .
we always wondered what they knew about us .
he rides me .
once , our car was arrested , and he was caught by a chinese police officer .
but we &apos;re going to take a big chunk of data samples from all the different cases , and the results are represented in different cases is important because we &apos;re looking at solving the edges , and finding the rules of this disease .
it makes more than a million syrian colonies in famine , and many people have lived ,  UNK  and  UNK  trees .
many of them are drowning .
there &apos;s a very happy story that i read in a magazine magazine about years ago .
but i didn &apos;t give up . i keep thinking .
why do you don &apos;t tell us before ? &quot; &quot; you &apos;ve ever asked . &quot;
some of north korea in china has been the foreign embassy to be refugees to refugees , but many of them had been buried by the chinese police and sentenced to water .
but you can see how we communicate together , they call each other , when they go to sleep .
the death is that something that we don &apos;t often encouraged to say , or even think of , but i &apos;m realizing that prepare to die is one of the most difficult things you can do .
we &apos;ve changed the course of business opportunity .
it &apos;s a packaging , as i said , you have a little bit of  UNK  candy .
the heart is the most expensive job and most challenging you can do , especially in the context .
we activate the community .
they said , &quot; we don &apos;t have freedom .
so i went there , and i went on facebook and ask for some people , and i went to me , i got a lot of positive feedback , i know to begin to work .
hi . i &apos;m a  UNK  , and in the short short time , i &apos;m a model .
the other consequences were being  UNK  compared , even after a  UNK   UNK  army ; co from the financial resources ; and the movement of the food system to eat their grandchildren and their children , these kids were often overlooked by the  UNK  of the military spending their mothers .
i want to look at a  UNK  piece where people can share the food .
this is the southern area :  UNK  , food ,  UNK  .
i used to be a typical victim because i didn &apos;t know about domestic violence , but signals .
when it comes out of their flipper , they  UNK  their own  UNK  .
and we continued to go to the border , but i had to use almost all of the money that she had to bribe the bribe .
since i went through the old age -- 1977 i &apos;m not talking about -- that &apos;s why -- i &apos;m doing it -- -- i worked in zambia -- kenya , kenya ,  UNK  , down , somalia , somalia , in collaboration with african projects with african countries .
we need to start to act like compassion and tolerance .
i &apos;m not talking about things , because free is not sustainable .
my grandfather is a  UNK  person .
i &apos;m always wondering , why they have electricity , we don &apos;t .
instead ,  UNK  went home to a friday night , and he told me that he thinks that his dream job , and he said , he &apos;s because he made me because he , because i made you feel safe , and he loves that he didn &apos;t want to show himself from the street , and he just wanted to go out of the city , and he just wanted to go out of the city , and he just wanted to go out of the city nearby , and he just wanted to go out of
for some people , they were connected to something very , giving , something at the point of something else that is shared patterns and the  UNK  skin .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to be a tree . &quot;
it &apos;s called  UNK  data .
why ? because they look at the same space and say , if the old population growth in this period , to move the population of the new york city that they have to need six million light , and that &apos;s six billion stars that doesn &apos;t need a way to deal with .
so far , i gave them seven to their homes in their community , and they all worked effectively .
and then once you call you , and you call you , and you &apos;ll have you with this huge network .
i lived in the southern area .
let &apos;s now climb it up . an android phone , blackberry , wow .
in the  UNK  synthesis ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , saving lives to save lives from  UNK  .
if you want to fold me , let your webcam along with your  UNK  , and we &apos;re going to look something .
let me tell you a secret .
he gives us a  UNK  of compassion .
it &apos;s twice the number of people in africa during the atlantic .
and in fact , it &apos;s my mind that i don &apos;t fit in the normal social mind , commonly often separated and  UNK  .
anyone who was sick or autistic illness could call me a low-cost , and warm , feedback , every time , and i was really pleased to announce that we had put into the first step in the next eight hours .
i see the pattern of blood flow up .
this is one of the lions who killed in nairobi .
making ideas ideas are not getting rid of them .
you know , the taliban came to afghanistan , from the age of afghanistan when i was six years old .
a  UNK  assessment for us to have 27 million people in the world today .
they &apos;re very curious . charles darwin tells him how he thinks he had seen , he didn &apos;t see how she needed to move on the sky .
you have a perfect memory .
and i &apos;m always saying , &quot; oh , i &apos;m found , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
so they can quickly move out of that , i started to plan my support .
they &apos;re supposed to have sex with their customers .
the desire of men has given the development of individual individual is the most important thing .
according to a  UNK  in the koran &quot; -- &quot; peace -- &quot; from the word of god cage ,  UNK  . &quot;
my family believe me .
in the himalayas , i saw kids have too many miles away from the mountain underneath the truck .
the digital industry is also used to think about when they &apos;re talking about .
then maybe  UNK  would have been working in this protest , and if you know who &apos;s the leader &apos;s behind , it would never be possible .
the next question that people always ask me , &quot; are all of you guys are being made right ? &quot;
some people don &apos;t even know they &apos;re turned into a slave , they did not go to 16 , 17 hours a day , because they spend .
for the next five years , i was like a boy in my son to walk with just a secret school because i was shoved out of a house .
but don &apos;t disappear into a kind of  UNK  revolution . &quot;
but they are different .
so we &apos;re wired to say , &quot; our tolerance of our own . &quot;
but when i went back to afghanistan , when i saw the students in my school and their parents to support them , encouraged them to me , i see a promising promise of transformation .
a tree calls up our garage , and he &apos;s got a third bridge .
he did something that was initially initially by my own way .
recently , in a journey , we &apos;re walking around , and when i was walking in the middle of my  UNK  , and it shows that red blood of the  UNK  shop that it chirps loved in our conversation .
the native people , the people , they &apos;re idiots . it &apos;s friends .
shortly after that , when i went through a summer , i saw a horror i didn &apos;t never forget .
what i never did , again , is a gun gun by somebody who said i loved .
he &apos;s really frustrated for the wedding and the family with me .
i was growing up in a country had been approved by the war .
more than 85 percent of the men are the men , and the violence that only happens in those intimate relationships , cooperating , long-term , workplaces , is in the family , where in the family , where in the family , where in the family , where in the family , where in the family , where in the family , where in the family , where , in the family , where we don &apos;t want to or believe that violence is that the cause of violence is that the cause of violence is the cause
the fishermen can affect your daughter , your sister , your best friend .
when what &apos;s the name of the name ? poet , is dead , kills dead ! and they &apos;re killing their talks .
there &apos;s no damage , but it &apos;s been unconnected to the  UNK  face , has to be corrected .
so with the help of my old friends and every night , i move on one side of this building into a huge umbrella and  UNK  it with a piece of music -- in the audience : &quot; before i die , i want to ... &quot; let me want to leave it with the tiniest body , their life , and shares their personal aspiration in public spaces .
i hope that you can see -- these pictures are not my images .
otherwise , she &apos;s not going to look like a look like me , and sure that &apos;s exactly the same thing that he was attacked .
and they released me . that &apos;s a miracle .
there were a few times , sitting around a week because of the taliban .
it &apos;s a  UNK  , and he &apos;s never going to be .
there &apos;s a new generation of people who are recruiting because of isolation .
you can see where the story are .
five days later , the  UNK  went on the stage , and i wore my mother &apos;s couch , and married married to me .
it &apos;s like to buy a special training .
now , that &apos;s exactly 86 percent ?
five years ago , i went through a little bit like alice in alice .
it &apos;s quite warm , in winter , but it &apos;s hot hot .
you know , he changed his life when he comes back , let me tell you why .
the following me is the bank of my father , and in the bank , a slum national park .
it just means that there &apos;s a kind of toasty .
thank you .
and yet , that &apos;s the truth , but it &apos;s just one half of the things , because something that we &apos;ve never seen before the lens , which i &apos;m never saying , like , &quot; i am gay . &quot;
this is the los angeles in los angeles .
the collapse of the berlin wall may not exist .
because even though it was arrested , but eventually i found it through the  UNK  from the international community .
because peace as a magnetic field , it needs to  UNK  , the disagreement between men and females .
i just have one request .
the woman brought us these records , luckily , when they could be recovered .
and yet , when we went through the borders , my family was caught in jail for the mall .
you can zoom in either either zoom , and you can also move backwards back faster or faster .
i tried to remove those lions &#91; in &#93; thought i was standing near the deck .
the nervous system doesn &apos;t work . they use all the infrastructure .
we started to repair these photographs .
for example , obesity rates in sub-saharan africa , for instance , talking about 16 kilometers away .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to be a hug again . &quot;
i don &apos;t remember whether you had a bar mitzvah piece of mine -- that &apos;s my wife , but i remember my first editor of songs in my ipod , the talk between us from four years old , my  UNK  , on my first day , and the birthday of  UNK  .
because i want to show people what the data is really .
how do we share our grandchildren about our memories of buildings , and more insights about our landscape ?
it happened twice two times in  UNK  .
so what happened ?
the people like us are  UNK  , kazakhstan , and we only have two ways to treat each other : or  UNK  , or crime .
UNK  knows what love is .
and started learning to prepare for the first place .
the age of 16-year-old . she  UNK  . she was very handsome .
in the skating , skating .
and i can &apos;t remember the first time that i was approached with autism , but i couldn &apos;t remember one day without it .
none of art , there &apos;s no color , no entanglement , don &apos;t care about light .
peter  UNK  , one of the greatest teachings in the history of death , died at the age , a few years ago .
when they grow up , they became more different , and the differences .
UNK  is the police armed police in germany .
however , there &apos;s a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
UNK   UNK  . in my language , it means that thank you very much .
what is the  UNK  reindeer ?
UNK  is used in a process .
we have no infrastructure .
now , among the most amazing people i met at there , i met a support for the liberation campaign , a member of  UNK  ,  UNK  .
the words became more expensive and more hours after a while , and that &apos;s one of the symptoms of it .
i was married to the second husband had nearly 20 years , and she had three children .
this  UNK  is actually used to  UNK  by hand , or a catcher , from parts of the colors and the rest of which has been damaged .
his grandmother was a  UNK  , and she was a mother to me , and the death of her death is inevitable .
well , i would wait for everyone else from other cultures like my  UNK  .
i want to introduce you to you .
who are you in the audience ?
so what do we do ? we &apos;re doing research on these birds . we &apos;re  UNK  them .
i was incredibly scared , and it felt like i was going to explode .
i &apos;m always a photograph .
the answer is easy .
so this time it doesn &apos;t .
all the same on the floor , and maybe we love to feel that the death is coming .
they were victims victims of disease , disease and violence .
a random unit because of trees on the ground , what are the people who don &apos;t care ? &quot;
as you can see , the lights off the outside , because it &apos;s the lion bones .
entrepreneurs don &apos;t come even though , and they don &apos;t really tell you , in the meeting meeting , what they want to do with their money , the opportunity they find out .
i don &apos;t have to do that country .
and i see their parents and dad , like my dad , their judgment , even though , even though they &apos;re having trouble in trouble .
we were able to make  UNK  incubators for low-cost costs to perform clinical trials , which is at the scale of the risk of the first time in the first time .
so what we can do is a  UNK  piece of steel to  UNK   UNK  , and we cut off the mouth piece of little nugget , and we put these little cubes with resins plastic .
but on one day , 1995 , my mother took a home of a letter to a grandmother .
we really need to communicate with people with scientists and engineers to change the world .
and when we were at the end of the landing , we gave the answer .
the smartest people in the  UNK  government , they never know because they don &apos;t get into a public meeting .
UNK  trust me , as a writer and a woman in which nobody has ever had .
and there &apos;s no idea that there &apos;s no idea , there &apos;s ignorance .
we shot off .
but when the exchange exchange came up , i &apos;ve noticed something that alice came together when she falls off and she opened up the door to the new world .
the grocery store , food ,  UNK  .
i couldn &apos;t stand for them .
so they kill lions .
i &apos;m going to be depressed , and they &apos;ll give me the information i request .
why women should stay stay with them ?
we can see them that many different countries , so if you just focus on the problems on the site , it will not make you .
and then successor .
and in this photo , i didn &apos;t have any left in real life .
he needed them to be protected .
and i &apos;m standing on this stage because i &apos;m a model .
he told us to follow in the way into the forest .
i lived in new york city , and last year , in short  UNK  adolescence were arrested and sentenced , which is 86 percent of blacks and a stranger .
a  UNK  stuck in water .
but this picture isn &apos;t just a proxy for a moment , or something special .
you need to go to the hospital to do it . it &apos;s very expensive , it means very expensive , which means this experiment in the clinical trials , it has never been done .
and this is my father was the first person in his family &apos;s education .
and we need to set up the survival of that before our political society .
if you get access to this information , you can see the work of the work , the society .
so i had to figure out how to solve this problem .
the whole idea is .
and i refuse to make sure that part of the reality was made this , which was made by me by somebody else , and i was making a reality for me .
watch this . yes , it  UNK  .
i hope that the pictures will provide a power in the viewer , the people like me , and hopefully the power will fire , fire , that fire will be  UNK  into the age , because there &apos;s no light , there &apos;s a light , the sum of the boar can continue to live in the dark .
in the last 28 years , i collected a lot about the larger culture in over the country , and in 2009 , i had the privilege to be the only director of the only expo in amsterdam conference in vancouver .
three years later years ago to use our house to open girls and girls in their neighbors .
and because the bubble is completely developing in the cage , the matrix of the lack of compassion .
so , why is so important ? first of them , they provide central trade services .
UNK  live and lives in his own world , with their own signature , and i feel joy in the most exciting things , like the cars around the room and look at the washing machine and eating anything in your heart .
i remember still looking down the eyes of their eyes , their hosts because a lot of people were under the ground to 72 hours .
i &apos;ve also hundreds of volunteers who believe that they can &apos;t sit down at home , so i decided to join them with a long time .
even if i taped my head into my head , and i &apos;m down on the floor , the killing my dog , the key to the car , when i was driving , that i was driving , and when i was driving that in my head when i was wearing the evening of my interview , i never once thought of myself as a maid wife .
all right .
because it &apos;s so big , it &apos;s going to disappear , so the path is .
in order to solve this , we built these materials material .
we &apos;re talking about them talking about the sacrifices , but the necessity is necessary to embrace the great creatures and the benefits they are .
and i made this project last year , and i started getting hundreds of letters from the people who wanted to make a wall in their community , so their students -- and i did a tool , and now that the future has been done in the world , including south africa , australia -- australia .
the last question that people ask me is , &quot; how did it feel to be ? &quot;
the most recent studies have shown in the areas that don &apos;t have to be able to remove about three times to four times to biodegrade , and the tremendous consequences of this is the spread of disease .
the bottom line up over 24 feet , and more than three miles later in the land .
but unfortunately , i have to tell you about year , a graduate student in new york city is that all the pattern on the blackboard , and in the  UNK  that employed employed , only 27 percent , less than four .
stability is much more difficult to me than i imagine .
but the thing that my heart is more fond and soul me is that even though this is , even though this is true , even though they don &apos;t look at normal , this is only possible .
well , of course , a lot of attacks , and the thing of this puzzle is a  UNK  situation , cockroach can happen .
it began  UNK   UNK  , so a few weeks later , i flew to los angeles  UNK  to meet the director of  UNK  and asked them to help them .
it &apos;s only about 300 dollars , and to test this test in the doctors .
i took a hole because i couldn &apos;t count the sensor from the stage .
we will change the concept of  UNK  .
in a year , i &apos;ve 27 27 years ago and the government came to me , &quot; what do you do ?
there &apos;s no food , to get rid of food , because they &apos;re flooded by the end .
and i said , &quot; of course , i &apos;m not scared of them .
&quot; it &apos;s amazing to travel , and work with creative creative , inspiring inspiration .
who &apos;s called who ? who &apos;s somebody who sent someone email ?
however ,  UNK  had to be a burden , a legacy of  UNK  , corruption and  UNK  .
the state university school asked me , a teacher teacher would teach a project to communicate .
over the number of people , i don &apos;t just go back , and because of a sudden treated , slowly , to move it down into smaller little girls .
they can hardly not have a diet -- a husband .
let &apos;s find out of her book .
and i really wanted to give up my learning , but my father would say , &quot; listen , &quot; she said , &quot; mommy , you can lose everything .
there &apos;s about  UNK  information .
thank you very much .
thank you .
so this is an amazing target that i think we can do now .
when i was a young boy , i sat down a friend who was a very shaky driver , and she went down to the waist down , we were summoned to stop , and all i did was saying , &quot; excuse me police , and we could walk .
when you get dengue dollars a dollar loan , you will give you a total amount of lentils for 75 dollars .
he was , &quot; the taliban have gone ! &quot;
i was wondering a little bit , what do i do with it ?
&quot; before i die , i wanna somebody to somebody else . &quot;
but today i &apos;m going to talk about yourself and my phone , and about how it changed my life .
and if you use your cell phones , it &apos;s the place where it exists .
from here , these  UNK  .
babies are more likely than younger babies babies , their kids , they  UNK  them on their head using liquid water carts , rope and  UNK  .
and this is me now .
kenya has a  UNK  wing in africa where the engine will be at  UNK  .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve made a crazy love , that i &apos;m walking through the first step into psychology , money and the  UNK  .
when a picture like this was counted , it &apos;s going to make a big difference in your life .
by this invention , i was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in kenya , the international international school , and i was really excited about it .
they help  UNK  bacteria . they help  UNK  their kidneys that could spread and  UNK  vast amounts of the livestock to the animals .
every time when we use our phones ?
but this sounds really cool ?
and i had a switch for projectors and open up .
please don &apos;t tell me that i &apos;m normal .
you have to learn how to make these people to talk to you .
it should have to let it stop the  UNK  , and let me show you the effectiveness of therapy .
tell you what you heard here .
he explained it very clear that the emotions are dangerous in places like this , not with me , but for them .
one day , the nightmare went into the truth , i was attacked by the chinese police and gave it to police police .
i &apos;ve been working on the organization of italy , and every project that we project in africa .
you have to create a new .
at the end of the time , he insisted us and tear down the car .
this is the first time that i saw this stage at ted stage , i think you &apos;re very lucky to be seen with this slide here .
it &apos;s built from being stalled , and it &apos;s a car that runs a car that runs it on it , it &apos;s not all the time . but it &apos;s not always , but it &apos;s not always , but it &apos;s not always the case today , but it &apos;s not about it today , but it &apos;s not .
when you see an awful lot like this , the first thing that comes out in your mind is , these are beautiful creatures that are ugly , ugly , and eating them to sleep , to the politicians .
the fear was creepy in silence .
food is a problem and food is a solution .
but he &apos;s little boy , she was arrested .
and yet , he &apos;s going to be free to school with the help of local workers , like  UNK  , and determination , like this , show up the faces of the people who are scared to me .
it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a career path .
so today i &apos;m going to try to explain what you do .
now my idea was used across all across the country to shake animals animals like hyena ,  UNK  , and it also used to be used for fishermen to the  UNK  of the people .
it &apos;s kind of arrogant .
however , every little bit of a sudden , the  UNK  from the elections and the revolution revolution disappear -- when every single day through us , we wake up with the news of violence .
he was horrified because he was scared of water .
north korea has discovered the amount of money that i send paint to family , and , for punishment , they will bring my family planning to a place in a rural zone .
thank you .
why did i do that ?
when you describe science , carefully carefully use the term .
kofi is the embodiment of the ability to be .
&quot; before i die , i &apos;d like to sing for millions of people . &quot;
i &apos;m south carolina in north korea , north korea ?
because it comes from north korea to korea , so i had to fly to china and go back to the south east north korea .
so what do you do -- you get your mouth .
a lot . today , most of us have a mobile phone .
the first project , the inspiring project for my first book , &quot; but i lived in  UNK  , &quot; is a project in which the community decided to teach people in the food .
the young man took the top of the military school , now , liberals , justice , social justice .
and we continue to ask , why did she left ?
every day , we went to a different way to get people to doubt about our destination .
this is an intuitive image of life in six months .
and the second thing i want to suggest is that people who think that violence has happened to women , women are women .
i realized that the man was loved me to kill me if i went back to him .
afghanistan was very different from the u.s.
they &apos;re the way that we spend time for a week , and we think about our time and how we changed every year , not just the physical eye .
thank you very much . welcome her email .
in the &apos; 90s , north korea has suffered a famine famine .
when i first went through a  UNK  .
there &apos;s a lot of ways that people around us can help improve our lives .
where did i come from ? ?
and i &apos;m here today .
only one mistake : the staircase is coming from .
that doesn &apos;t exist .
we need to measure the progress in the way , and at the end , the only way that we know when we actually have a treatment , is when we have a  UNK  french that can be certainty .
i was 22 years old , harvard graduate school .
and i wondered , how do you feel when there &apos;s no good food for health , when every time out of your time you have to see the bad impacts without the food system ?
after the last six o &apos;clock in the u.k. , commander of the team has joined the  UNK  of  UNK  , in hundreds of people have died more than a photo , more importantly , most of all of his friends , about it , and it &apos;s important .
if you have access to information , you can control the whole population .
but as soon as we sometimes have seen the scan of kew , but after about 10 minutes , looking back to the scan , put us through the glass , to put down to a  UNK  server , a stranger , in a place , in a world , in a world , in a world , in the world .
it &apos;s a small bottle of  UNK  , with population of 50,000 people , one of the first places that are affected by the tsunami .
and in the year , the crew team came together , and the prediction about what would happen to new york city in 100 years , and the conclusion was like this : the new york city will not exist in 100 years .
i &apos;m showing you -- for 10 years of my experience , because it &apos;s not unlike the cardiac surgeon , so just a short time .
i want all of us to be blue flowers ,  UNK   UNK  .
i &apos;m not trying to inspire you with the success story to create a list of  UNK  and the elections .
then , when you go home , let &apos;s tell your friends that the private sector is a value of the 21st century , and that is not obsolete .
it &apos;s not the cost of employees .
it &apos;s more than 12,000 heights , long  UNK  .
each photograph of someone calls someone or something , a relationship , a massage .
eventually , after six months , with the march war with the  UNK  led to the people , we went to liberate our country and  UNK  .
each of my son from six to nine , in my community , was responsible for my father , and i had to do the same thing .
the party is greater than the entrepreneurs .
&quot; you can actually go to school , and he said .
we had the opportunity to start looking for the earliest attributes of the disease before it was too late .
and he said that he needed these gun because the damage that he had experienced in the past as a child .
but these girls are lucky .
now i want to introduce you to my older brother .
this is a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and i tried to explain those things that were in the ways that i was able to understand .
they &apos;ve encountered a mirror of a  UNK  of  UNK  with  UNK   UNK  .
every 20 minutes , i have to go back to the formula for the machine to treat the equipment , and let them operate under their temperatures , and when you sit there , i think , my camera is better than done .
she &apos;s not greedy . i don &apos;t separate the skin .
you may say , &quot;  UNK  and  UNK  , &quot; why don &apos;t stop &quot;  UNK  and  UNK  . &quot;
i think my life comes here is the end , but i still try to control their feelings and answer their questions .
the question , &quot; why is there ? &quot;
looking through the video game , it appears to be ordinary people , but when we look close , there are more lucky ones that are working in the situation situation , including children .
and i realized that it had to end .
and that &apos;s how light hits the lions when they arrive at night .
don &apos;t get me .
how do you make that ? you can become an active , create a speech , you can write things to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these  UNK  organisms . this little bit of time .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done here . you look at the experiment that we did , and then of course that this line is going to be cured , and that &apos;s what we learned from experimentation .
what would you go from these samples ?
the most important thing we have is time and people with other people .
and i help these people who know how to work together and you have these tuna tuna that don &apos;t have a factory factory at the pentagon 60 years ago , but we found a way to sell to san francisco for $ 15 dollars , and then the farmers who come up to say , &quot; hey , can you help us ? &quot;
the crazy thing is happening normally , so everything around me is that dark into the darkness when it comes to light from the west is only one of my life .
i moved to new york city when i work for the first job and writing for the magazine magazine .
i didn &apos;t know , but i could see that my dad was very , very happy .
after that , i volunteered to participate in  UNK   UNK  , in a couple of days , went to the scene to get involved in response .
when he took me home , phone  UNK  , a  UNK  voice him if he continued to his daughter to school , they would try it again .
i had a little bit scared .
now we have taught the business for teenage girls at age 16 , we started the classroom by giving them the first two  UNK  of  UNK  richard  UNK  , and work for the at the time at the 16 , was the first round of the  UNK  in the first of  UNK  richard  UNK  how much of the  UNK
and that box makes a sock box .
the fighters members of the community , and the cattle were also concerned about this .
we said to the russians , &quot; god , the  UNK  ! &quot;
their high-heeled shoes are uncomfortable , i &apos;m not going to wear them .
you &apos;ll be surprised to what you can do if you turn them into fabric .
and you can see here , like 400,000 people in the audience in the street hall , and they say , &quot; yes , freedom , no fear . &quot;
i &apos;m a performer .
but if no one for those things , if they don &apos;t see the effects of food , i can , they can &apos;t eat anything in the front door .
so how do trials trials on their voices compared to practice clinical trials ? both are not  UNK  .
i want it to be the public .
the aspiration of female women aim for development is the most important thing .
we &apos;ve never met a single person in the world , which you can do , you and execute them at the same time .
i &apos;ve met  UNK  in a night night , bought and cold .
these are infected by the one of the grave in another part of ghana .
thank you very much .
and how do we share a lot more of our hopes for the candidates , in our societies , our communities can reflect our need and our dream ?
UNK  information .
in this period , we haven &apos;t just a thousand dollars for the equipment and the material , most of the cost for the ink ink .
that &apos;s at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning i &apos;m wearing sleeping sleeping .
so what i &apos;m talking about is the business spirit is where it exists .
after i took the money and gave the bribes , the family i was released in a month , and then again , again , again .
the most important thing is desire .
in japanese , i was , we walked up the town of  UNK  , far more about the north to the himalayas town .
the man i was more than ever woken up all the gun in the pain and the killing kill me that i couldn &apos;t remember .
i don &apos;t treat any people from other cultures as they were me . &quot; i love them too . &quot;
no doubt that his female will be educated , including his daughter , including taliban , and despite the dangers .
it &apos;s all that .
one day we had a news with the news of the  UNK  lamps and the sultan of the apprentice .
you can see all of that .
i had a legacy in  UNK  .
we &apos;re trying to identify their basic framework , and in the oil where they arrive .
being bathed in the lower atmosphere of the ages , the men , women , children , the children , the children , the whole family , the dam , the dam , the  UNK  dam , the ceilings , the ceilings , the ceilings , the ceilings , i  UNK  them , and i brought them from those holes colored beds .
and i was fumbling on the painting , and it was curiously , and i saw the  UNK  ,  UNK  my  UNK  , and my  UNK  used my  UNK  like a  UNK  to  UNK  my hands and silence me wherever i couldn &apos;t breathe or shouting , and he used to  UNK  my head into the  UNK  .
this is my life in six months , has been recorded in this data .
but the restaurants part of the cloud , as known as part of the  UNK  .
a lot of people are being beaten up against their families , and when they went to a country , they had to start with very little , or less money .
the money can get chopped down . that can be taken away from the rest of the war .
&quot; before i die , i wanted to be a  UNK  on earth . &quot;
i know that sweden is invented invention , but they want to do their own .
i always live in a certain fear that my identity will be discovered , and i &apos;m going to pay back to life in north korea .
it &apos;s a year in 1989 , and imagine people who stood up and  UNK  the life there &apos;s a cell phone cycle .
but there &apos;s no hope to leave this house and go somewhere else where we &apos;re  UNK  . &quot;
so many years ago , i had this idea : why not us , only , instead , instead , instead of a community , and said to people where they should do , why don &apos;t , listen to them , or not ?
hi . thank you .
but a  UNK  after a hundred feet , they taped the bag that they had to send them to the other , where they were tested to gold .
you can see here in thousands of people who stood up and  UNK  for change .
in our lifetime consumption , this is more important than ever to find ways to find a way to find a way to look at a moment , and remember that life is a short term .
we , transnational aid countries that brought to sub-saharan africa 1 billion today in the last 50 years .
that &apos;s actually a story to go to clinic , and if any patient can make a test ?
this is one of the first photos that i used to photograph , which was the first time that i took photograph of eight , and then i didn &apos;t even have a cycle .
in a culture , they did it &apos;s very important . in places like , well , there &apos;s no shelter to choose to kill , or not  UNK  , but also the  UNK  provide a natural system .
you can see the most important section , like the leaders in a group .
you see , some people don &apos;t do it . they can &apos;t call me .
the  UNK  and the lions make them feel that i was walking around the bottle , but actually i was sleeping on my bed .
north korea has to overcome the boundaries that seem to seem to be freedom to come .
i didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any kind of violence has sex and  UNK  .
in  UNK  los angeles , people dying dying .
someone told me that i was in north korea , so they tested my  UNK  and asked me a lot of questions .
so i asked my home to use ,  UNK   UNK  , the largest supplier of the people in the same time , and i asked them to me , please send their information that they had to store .
i was in a very difficult situation at the election period , a monolithic environment , an environmental environment that was created by  UNK  and  UNK  .
he had to go back to the flow of the sun .
when you go back home , let &apos;s tell you , by the owner of the companies , because of the companies and companies can get rid of specific information , even though they don &apos;t necessarily have to do it .
so , are you going to continue to continue ?
but mostly it &apos;s hard to  UNK  a legacy of sex and poor issues while i &apos;m one of the greatest benefit .
because my family didn &apos;t know the chinese , so i had to go to the people in 2000 in china .
UNK  doesn &apos;t help prevent the transmission of disease .
i believe that the open dream of the world is the ability to communicate .
with a cell phones , you can scan a message on the defendant and start joining a protest against the government in egypt .
but then i said , i want to argue these information .
you could give someone a idea .
so for  UNK  online and  UNK  data , i do the same thing .
then if you drive up on the street , you will destroy these  UNK  -- as we just saw here .
this is how i help other victims , and this is my final request .
this is eight years old .
in the country , countries like india and pakistan , four types of  UNK  have been used in the list of  UNK  , which means that they &apos;re less than 10 or 15 years to slow it , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s because it &apos;s because they &apos;re interrupted , and they &apos;re submerged because they &apos;re duct .
i was climbed out of that hole , and they went home , but they would never get home , because they had a  UNK  .
they showed a  UNK   UNK  from east to tibet and to go to the south .
now ,  UNK  didn &apos;t go back into one day and said , &quot; know , all this kind of venue and juliet is beautiful , but i need to move into the next stage where i believe and  UNK  , &quot; so therefore , so i should have to take her out of this house where people who have heard her back and forth and her colleagues can see the wrinkles . &quot;
and then she was going to hit me two weeks every week for two months and years since i was married .
the project also creates the great difference in life .
i would like to share some of the secret to make sure that we see the science of pheromones , sexy , very accurately .
and with a telephone , you can scroll through a song , post it up and  UNK  .
i married married to a good man and good , and we had them together .
and i feel that there &apos;s a tight pressure in the room because it &apos;s not so i shouldn &apos;t wear this .
this is me with a soccer team in the magazine magazine .
i want to give you a sense of your behavior . very impressive .
well , i made an app , and this is a unique problem for anyone who works the math , which is that we like the managers .
in school , we spend a lot of time to learn about the president of the  UNK  of a  UNK  --  UNK  , but we don &apos;t learn so much about the outside world , except for the united states and south asia .
so in the lower arctic , you can see an example of the  UNK  of  UNK  .
this is not a mother who doesn &apos;t matter to succeed .
i was when i was when i was born , and i was so excited that there was a new person in my life .
UNK  has a great history of their importance .
have you ever wondered why why call &quot;  UNK  ? &quot;
like me , they dream .
two little boys and wind , two hours of her son were in school , two different schools .
i installed it in my two years ago , since we had no problem with lions .
we love artists to  UNK  and dance , you &apos;ll see here .
it &apos;s very easy to  UNK  these grandiose images .
i &apos;m an organization of  UNK  women who said to honor for homelessness to a  UNK  legislation , which legislation can bring citizens to their citizens , whether they were , to vote , vote and vote , and most importantly , to most importantly , and most importantly , and most importantly , and importantly , and most importantly , and most importantly , and most importantly , and the most important thing that are in the their list made a list of  UNK  .
i wanted to read an email to finish this talk . this email from  UNK  , a person to help him , sent me back from the next six months .
every year of thousands of north korea were arrested in china and sentenced to the country , where they were tortured , tortured or tortured .
well , you get the oil .
i was so surprised by a stranger that was not interested in that kind of question .
i realized that the problem is the solution .
this is  UNK  . when fathers died , he was brought to the temple .
we get rid of these quads ,  UNK  .
