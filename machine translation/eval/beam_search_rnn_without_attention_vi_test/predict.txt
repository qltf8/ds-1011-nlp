how do i &apos;m going to talk about my life on the last 10 years of her life in the last 10 years of her life , she was going to be able to live in the last 10 years of her life with her life in the  UNK  of her life , and she was going to talk about the  UNK  of her life in the last 10 years ?
this story is not the end .
it &apos;s a game game .
let me tell you a few examples .
so imagine the first time : the first one of the  UNK
he was a leader called  UNK  , who was a leader , who will be a leader of democracy that he had never been  UNK  .
imagine , imagine a man who had his life ,  UNK  his life .
the last five months , he goes back to you , for months .
he put it in the morning .
he was convicted ,  UNK   UNK  .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but much more of our lives in our lives .
i had never forget my life in my life .
my job was my mission to my life , and my colleagues , and in the last couple of years , but we had no idea , but we &apos;ve had a lot of our lives .
the bottom line here is a picture of  UNK   UNK  .
my mom , my mother was born with her granddaughter , she had a two-year-old girl , she had a two-year-old girl , she had a girl who had a girl .
and the mother of mother , the mother of mother , the mother of life is going to live in the house of life .
the mother never had never been taught .
so after four years later ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
all of all kinds of adults .
the fear of death is death , death , death and death .
it &apos;s almost most of my friends in my family , because i had a  UNK  .
if we were the first day , i &apos;m going to go , and i &apos;m going to go .
the first night i came up to the boat of the boat to the boat of the boat to the boat of the boat -- the boat of the boat to the boat of the boat in the boat , and then on the boat .
i don &apos;t remember when i was killed by the first time , so many people were killed by the  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK   UNK  .
but i was walking around the first day , and i was able to come up with a series of  UNK  , which was the first time , and the  UNK  , and the  UNK  , and the
there &apos;s no way to make it .
after three months later , we were working on the left side .
and the bottom line here , the next generation of the three generations of people who are helping each other .
we grew up in the phoenix islands , which is the number of people in the  UNK  .
it &apos;s not like any areas of water , but i don &apos;t know , there &apos;s no evidence that i &apos;m not there .
from the  UNK  from around the world around the world .
and the people in the middle of the middle east that they &apos;re talking about , where they &apos;re talking about .
my job was working in my work , and then after all the time , after two weeks .
so it &apos;s still listening to my mother and english .
we &apos;re very poor .
all of all the time you have to do ; it &apos;s a  UNK  ; it &apos;s a  UNK  ; and it &apos;s a  UNK  ; it &apos;s all the time ; it &apos;s the same thing , and it &apos;s the same thing .
two hours to each other , they &apos;re going to wait for a second life .
it was a very high school , because it was a year after year .
sometimes , i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to do it , but if you go to the middle east . &quot;
where ?
there &apos;s something in my mind .
the word says , &quot; and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
my mom , and my mother went to bed .
it &apos;s  UNK  , who &apos;s listening to us , and i &apos;m going to tell you all the time .
my mom was raised in a boat .
my job is my mom to teach her mother .
her mother had a computer program , and then we had a whole bunch of laptops .
and then the woman tells the stories of men and women and women , the middle of the women , the middle of the women , the middle of the world war .
we went to  UNK  and  UNK  .
the centers center .
i live in the world .
in one of the world , i &apos;m going to say , for the first time .
in one of the world , i &apos;ve been involved in the process of violence , the violence , of course ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
but through a lot of years of my father has been harassed .
and then , when i was my first year , i was a year , and the year 2000 was a year .
and i came out from this room in the middle east , but they &apos;re not a  UNK  .
it &apos;s about 2,000 years old , and in the middle east , there are hundreds of thousands of people who have never seen before .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know how to use it .
i don &apos;t know about it .
i don &apos;t know what about it .
i &apos;d like to talk about three days and every day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of
i said , i can &apos;t do it .
my mother &apos;s mother with his mother .
they said , &quot; no one .
&quot; and i said , &quot; do you say , &quot; no one another . &quot;
so i &apos;m talking about women and civil society and civil society , and the civil society .
and i said , i became more .
i met people who live in a lot of people who live in their lives , where people live in their lives .
and even though i realized i realized that i didn &apos;t know that it was  UNK  .
that &apos;s a picture .
and at the time time , i realized that the time is that it &apos;s a  UNK  , and i think , it &apos;s a  UNK  , and it &apos;s a  UNK  .
because it &apos;s not limited in your body , but in your body can be in your body .
now i was trying to get rid of the world , but i said , &quot; i don &apos;t know that .
but that &apos;s not going to be able to be used to be used before .
there is an opportunity to be an opportunity , which is an  UNK  and  UNK  .
so i went to my journey .
i &apos;ve come with a little bit of &quot;  UNK  &quot; -- we &apos;re not going to do it . &quot;
for one year we had a year .
just as i said , i &apos;m going to do a little bit of
we worked on the night .
all of our ideas are great ideas , and we were pretty amazing , but we made a great idea .
i decided to go to the united states .
there &apos;s another thing .
it was again .
three months later , and i ended up the journey .
just before i &apos;m going to tell you about me .
there are three  UNK   UNK   UNK  and  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
life has happened in the last century .
her grandmother was three after three times .
her mother &apos;s mother  UNK  .
at the age of 17 years , he was a  UNK   UNK  .
and it &apos;s hard to kill it , and it &apos;s not a  UNK  diet , and even though it was worse .
&quot; you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s wrong .
i was sitting in a room in a room room , and she sat in a hotel room .
and i looked at the bottom line there .
i knew she had come to me .
a few minutes later .
so a few days later , we &apos;re sitting in a workshop in the middle of the  UNK  and sitting there .
we love to three and three times three times .
and when we came up to a workshop , and we had to go to the hotel .
her mother told her mother .
my mom mother said , &quot; mom , mom , mom , why did you ? &quot;
&quot; because of the words , &quot; thank you . &quot;
&quot; not only  UNK  . &quot;
if there &apos;s a family in our family , women &apos;s family planning .
because we are , as we have the people who we believe , and we can change our lives of our lives of our lives .
the failure will be easy .
now i also want to be , and i &apos;m going to go .
who wants to want to have their children ?
but i was afraid of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
can i hope a living in life , in a new way of life ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could find that , and i &apos;ll find it , and i &apos;ll say , i &apos;m going to wait for me .
well , of course , my mother &apos;s going to sit in a couple of years .
it &apos;s true for me to share it , and i don &apos;t share with it .
i &apos;ve been long for a long time in prison , and in the last two years .
i was also working with the community of the community of the community of community and the community of people .
and i came back to this and i said , &quot; and i &apos;m listening to me .
and one of the most exciting things that i &apos;ve got here is that you have one of the time you have to have your attention .
and you can talk about a lot of things in the world .
and sometimes you &apos;re going to make yourself in the power , and if you don &apos;t have to get it for you .
and i think this is really important because i think is really important .
we &apos;ve got some great articles .
and what i think is that if you think , what is the most important thing , what you do is , what if you do is , what it means is that if you mean , what if you mean , what you have is a meaningful meaning .
and if you &apos;re a doctor , if you can do good , you can do something else , you can do something else .
that &apos;s why i want to talk about javascript .
in fact , i don &apos;t know when i &apos;m going to do when i work out of my job .
i really learned this from my grandmother .
i grew up in a family , and i grew up in the family of the american family and family .
it &apos;s very , very , very , very powerful and  UNK  .
there are three times in the family .
it &apos;s always the same thing in the family .
her grandmother was three times .
her parents were born in the &apos; 80s in the 1900s .
and she was born in three years , and she was forced to  UNK  her life .
she was  UNK  , but she was  UNK  .
when i met her , she gets up to her , and i &apos;m going to go to her .
her grandmother came up to me , and then i realized that she came up .
one , two years ago , if i had three times , and i said , &quot; what do you want to do ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; if i said , &quot; if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; i &apos;m not going to say , &quot; and i &apos;m going to say , &quot;
three of the three things that you want to be .
the only challenge is that she gets 10 .
my mom is mother in the house .
occasionally , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes i &apos;m going to get care of the time .
my grandmother have been everywhere everywhere .
and i was there , and i remember , there was a little girl , and i was walking around the room , and i was going to go through all the room , and i was going to go to the room room .
she sat there at me .
at first time , we &apos;re playing playing games .
and then i looked at her eyes .
fifteen minutes , 15 minutes , 15 minutes , 15 minutes , and she said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to tell you . &quot;
i remember yesterday , like that day is something like that .
and i will never forget it .
she came out of the house , and she said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you this room , and she said , &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m not sure . &quot;
and then she sat down , and she said , &quot; you know what i want to do .
&quot; i think you are the children . &quot;
&quot; you can think of what you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget it .
and she said , &quot; she said , &quot; three , three , three . &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
the other thing she &apos;d like to say , &quot; love is the love . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like , &quot; your daughter &apos;s daughter , which is going to listen to you . &quot;
well , i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
the third thing : &quot; i want to do you want to do the same thing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
at the end of the third end of her , &quot; you know what you want to do it . &quot;
well , i thought , &quot; well , i &apos;m so sorry . &quot;
i grew up in the middle east , and i grew up , and i grew up a little boy .
when i was 14 years old , i went back to him , and i didn &apos;t know about it , and i was going to know what it was going to him .
the same thing is that we &apos;ve done things .
and he came up with a man who gave me a  UNK  and me .
i said , &quot; no , no . no . no . no . i &apos;m no . &quot;
he said , &quot; i &apos;m doing today , we &apos;re doing today , and what you do today . &quot;
he had a little kid , and i said , &quot; i have a little bit more . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , no , no longer . &quot;
and he looked at me .
and i said , &quot; do you go ? &quot;
he looked at me , and he said , &quot; well , i &apos;m not going to listen to you . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you doing ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; you tell you all these things . &quot;
so , i &apos;m here .
i &apos;d like to do with you one of you .
i &apos;m not talking about .
i know i &apos;m going to talk about this .
but i &apos;m going to go , and i said , i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m going to have a child .
no , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m supposed to be happy ; i &apos;m happy to be happy ; i &apos;m happy to speak .
as we make a new world that we can make sense that we can make things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can make them what they think they can do .
every time i think of all of you all know i heard about all of these things .
i &apos;ve been in the middle of the  UNK  and the
he was convicted of death .
and of course , of course , we have to think about .
and i was trying to have been talking about the system .
the country said , we &apos;ve been over 100 years ago .
in the year , there was a  UNK  .
today , it has a number of numbers .
the united states has the united states in the united states .
and there were seven million people in the  UNK  .
in my mind , i think this is changing the world .
for the poor people , the people who lived in the living room .
there are three men in the men who are coming in between 30 or 30 years .
in this country , in the middle east , the united states , san francisco , who lived in the middle east , who lived in the middle east , who lived in the middle east , where they were born .
our heritage system is not only by the way , but by the way , but by the way , but by the way .
we &apos;re going to have a lot of people who are willing to be rich , if you &apos;re willing to have a lot of people who are willing to be willing to be willing to poor people who are willing to do with them better .
it &apos;s not obvious , and it &apos;s not to me .
and even though , it seems to do that .
the fear of fear and fear and fear that we don &apos;t believe that we have .
so we are .
but this brings me to care about it .
we &apos;re looking at some of the developing developing world .
i live in my country , if you live in your country , and then you have the same way that you &apos;re going on .
right now , in the middle east , there is a percentage of  UNK  .
we &apos;re going to be seen that the last 10 years ago will be the last 10 years before .
and there &apos;s a  UNK  .
i want to pay for children .
there are lots of lots of things .
america are the united states in the united states .
we &apos;re not  UNK  for  UNK  children .
we &apos;re actually looking at all kinds of babies .
it &apos;s the only countries in the world .
i &apos;m going to tell the people .
the question is very interesting about it .
in many ways , we learn how many people are being asked , how do they die ?
this is a question .
but there are still changing our minds in our minds .
the way i think about is whether or not whether or whether or whether or is whether or whether or is whether or whether or is whether or not ?
i mean , it &apos;s true !
the united states is in the u.s.
it was taken out of people who were taken out of  UNK  , and we found out of the  UNK   UNK  .
so this is a  UNK  slate in the middle of a  UNK  .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that .
in the hospital , if you &apos;re never going to wake up every day , and then there &apos;s no one that every single one night .
but by the way , we &apos;ve got this problem .
it &apos;s not a problem of our problems .
it &apos;s not our destiny .
it &apos;s not the same thing that we need to do .
i talk about a lot of these problems .
it &apos;s about about poverty and poor people .
and what &apos;s interesting to me is that when i &apos;m going to tell their stories about their own stories about their own stories about their families .
this year from the end of the 19th century and i started to  UNK  the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know about this .
but for the united states here in africa .
hundreds of people have been trafficked .
they &apos;re  UNK  .
and that &apos;s why the rise of their lives .
the people say , &quot; and said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to talk to you , but in fact , i think you &apos;re going to talk about it in the world .
or tell us that we had to do with that .
and of course , of course , the civil war between the civil war and the civil war and civil war .
we see these guys , but we don &apos;t want to share our problems .
we don &apos;t want to talk about history .
and therefore , we didn &apos;t understand how it works .
we are  UNK  .
it &apos;s not  UNK  and  UNK  .
we do it hard when we &apos;re uncomfortable , because we don &apos;t believe that we &apos;re willing to be willing to pay attention .
in south africa , they don &apos;t know if they don &apos;t know , and they don &apos;t know why they don &apos;t know .
in the meantime , in the end of the country , there was no other things that we didn &apos;t know , there was no longer done .
i &apos;ve got a few thousand tedtalks in english .
it &apos;s really hard for me , and i said , &quot; well , i mean , but it &apos;s really hard to me , &quot; you know what you are . &quot;
&quot; china doesn &apos;t have sex .
and of course , we &apos;re never going to be in india . &quot;
we need to go into the room in the room and she said , &quot; we &apos;ve never seen it .
it &apos;s hard to do that , or whether it &apos;s not to do it . &quot;
and i think about this .
what if you &apos;re living in the world , when you say , it &apos;s a  UNK  .
i can &apos;t be .
it &apos;s too late .
in our country , in our country , there &apos;s a  UNK  who &apos;s  UNK   UNK  , who &apos;s  UNK  , if it &apos;s a  UNK   UNK  , because of the people who are killed at the end of the end of the day of the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , because of the people who were killed .
and therefore , there is a  UNK  .
i think that our ancestors are doing is .
when we don &apos;t care about things , but it &apos;s very important .
we love .
i love love , love .
like .
but in the end of the end , the end of the end of the end of the end of the , and , of course , and the
for me , it &apos;s a really important thing to do .
so we &apos;re talking about talking about more and more important , and more importantly , and more importantly , more importantly in the world .
for that , for me , for the time , for the time , for the time , for the time to talk about the people who don &apos;t think about it .
however , think about how to think about our lives .
you know , we &apos;re going to have to believe , but what we &apos;ve never seen before .
well , we are . we give you the ones .
innovation , innovation , and innovation is not just in our own ideas .
they &apos;re ideas from their own ideas .
and that is the connection , and our desire , and what i &apos;m going to do is to make it , and the hope that i &apos;m not going to do .
dr.  UNK   UNK  , a  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
&quot; when we said , we need to have to be able to believe that what we want to do is , &quot; and we need to have a sense of what you want to do with all of us , and we don &apos;t need to have a sense of shame . &quot;
in fact , this is the  UNK  of the community that i &apos;ve never seen .
there &apos;s a connection between us and technology and technology , it &apos;s not just a good thing that it &apos;s not just for us .
now i &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s a lot of time when you &apos;re not aware of us .
it &apos;s just about .
i was a big fan , but i was a big fan , and i was a  UNK  kid .
three of three women , three  UNK   UNK  , three women ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , and the  UNK   UNK  , who &apos;s  UNK  , and the  UNK   UNK  , the  UNK   UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  .
these people were  UNK  and  UNK  .
and every time she goes up , and she &apos;d like to say , &quot; hey , i &apos;m going to go back to the audience , and i &apos;m going to talk to speak .
would you want to hear it ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to . &quot;
and she said , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and then i came , and i &apos;m going to go .
it &apos;s really hard for me for many years .
there was a few days ago , and i said , &quot; let me tell you a few words , and i said , &quot; let &apos;s talk about them .
and what &apos;s going on . &quot;
so i started talking .
&quot; well , we &apos;re talking about changing .
we &apos;re trying to try to help people who live .
try to try and try to restore the way in the
i &apos;m going to try to get rid of  UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s something about food .
it &apos;s a  UNK  . .
and the same thing is  UNK  .
and when i say , i said , &quot; oh , i mean , &quot; oh , i mean , &quot; oh , &quot; yeah , it &apos;s okay . &quot;
that &apos;s going to be  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  . &quot;
and at the same time , i said , &quot; well , if you &apos;ve got to go , &quot; and  UNK  , &quot; and i &apos;m not really hard . &quot;
i really think that the community needs to be more .
we need to find ways to deal with the challenge , and the things that the challenge is to challenge .
because all , we &apos;re living on the planet .
i learned what i learned when i was doing it .
it just taught me very simple .
and i believe that every one of the most important thing we &apos;ve ever had to do .
i believe it &apos;s true for people on earth .
i think it &apos;s a mistake , if they don &apos;t know it .
if any of the people who don &apos;t have a product , they don &apos;t have an idiot .
i mean , when you do it , you know , it &apos;s not a guy .
and therefore , we have people who have access to the law .
i also believe in many countries in this country , and it &apos;s not a lot of people in the world .
i don &apos;t believe it .
i really think that &apos;s a lot of interest in the middle east .
and finally , i believe that this is a very good news because it &apos;s not very , very , very , very , very , very , very , because of our own technologies and  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  .
and you don &apos;t have a lot of people who don &apos;t care about how to treat people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people who are affected by people ,
because this is our view of our consciousness .
sometimes , when i &apos;m going to end up with this story .
sometimes i have time .
i really enjoyed the same time .
and these ideas are our ideas in our ideas .
and i did was very impressed by young kids .
i met myself in the first day , and i met him to him , and he was able to do it .
and i started thinking , how do it happen ?
how can you a single person who you don &apos;t believe ?
it &apos;s a young boy , but it &apos;s a young boy .
and there was a very long time , and i think , if i started to make it a little bit of power , and they were able to do it .
well , there &apos;s  UNK  power .
so , i &apos;m a little bit .
and since i was writing , because i didn &apos;t start writing a way to write a book .
i mean , there was a woman in the middle east , and i was married .
i started working with this problem with my book , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; i &apos;ve got a heart attack , a hundred years old woman , &quot;
i mean , in fact , in fact , this is the  UNK  of the  UNK  and the  UNK
there &apos;s a very good thing about how this country doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s not all about the country .
the next morning , i woke up , and i thought , i &apos;ve got to write a book ?
in the course of course , i didn &apos;t want to write it , and i wrote it .
a few months ago , i &apos;m sorry .
and eventually i decided to end up and i decided to do this .
and i was walking in the room , and i felt very happy .
and i went into the summer .
so i think it &apos;s going to think about it .
and finally , i ended up at the end of the money .
and when i went out of my father , i met the first man , i met a  UNK  .
when this man came up to me , and he said , &quot; what do you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; well , i said , &quot; well , you &apos;re  UNK  . &quot;
and he goes up , and he goes up to me .
at the end of me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
and i have to tell you what i have to tell you about it .
it &apos;s something that for people in the community , for the human community , for the human community .
i went to the room .
and when i went in , i got to see them .
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got to do this ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , &quot; and i &apos;m going to start . &quot;
people were standing in the room because they were terrified .
so i wrote this .
it &apos;s got to  UNK  and  UNK  .
before i was talking about people , i &apos;m going to talk about the  UNK  , and , of course , about war , about war .
and even though , i don &apos;t look at the front of you , but i can see my eyes .
he looked at the same time , and he goes through all the time .
he goes away .
he walked into the room , and then he sat down .
it &apos;s about 10 minutes later later .
the police , the police department , the police department , because the police  UNK  police .
he came up to the group of people .
and he said , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and this man looked at the bottom line , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m looking at this , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m looking at the end of the street . &quot;
i believe in a lot of you believe in this , because it &apos;s a lot of people believe in the world , but it &apos;s a lot of it .
knowing how we know that people don &apos;t care about when people care and care .
and that all of us all of us is in the same time .
our creativity and all of our vision and the vision of the design , the arts and the arts and the design , the design of design and design .
for all these words , i &apos;m going to tell you about what &apos;s going to do , let &apos;s say , let me go .
thank you very much .
so you have heard of the audience , and you know what you &apos;ve heard about the future of the audience to do this .
instead of being able to be able to help us ?
well , there &apos;s always a lot of us .
for example , if you &apos;re living in california , you &apos;re going to be able to take a part of the california , and then we &apos;re going to be able to take a part of the
for example , we &apos;re going to pay for $ 15 million dollars a year , for example .
and the 99 percent of the people don &apos;t want to be  UNK  .
the percent of the percent of the don &apos;t done it .
so we have a chance to change this opportunity .
and the same opportunity to make sure that it would be the law of law and law enforcement .
and i think that &apos;s the opportunity for us .
the united states have been killed in the united states .
and part of the story is that part of the story of the time .
what are you going to tell you about this ?
in fact , in the middle of the violence .
the united states are actually killed in the united states don &apos;t have to pay attention .
this is the battle of war .
and the number of millions of people have been very rapidly .
and we &apos;ve lost our heart disease .
and so , we &apos;ve got rid of the  UNK   UNK  , who  UNK  the  UNK  for the people who paid their taxes in the united states .
i believe that we need to make sure that people don &apos;t need to be more comfortable because they &apos;re not  UNK  .
i think it &apos;s part of the future of us , who doesn &apos;t help us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
dr.  UNK  , you really don &apos;t have to be here .
he was really inspiring .
thank you very much for chris , thank you . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk about a little bit .
it &apos;s about  UNK   UNK  .
and because the idea was able to explain to explain , i &apos;ll tell you three minutes later .
the most interesting story is one of the most beautiful , one of my favorites .
you &apos;ve been here in the last couple of years .
and you think it &apos;s going to go to the mountains .
in fact , he &apos;s  UNK  .
and he said , &quot; well , one of them . &quot;
this is the  UNK  . .
one of the big species of this is the equivalent of the united states .
now , these are living in  UNK  .
this story . we &apos;ve talked about a lot of facts , and there &apos;s nothing about it .
but the point is , we still are .
we still think it &apos;s still .
but the european union , they &apos;re not yet .
so what happens here ?
the second story , there is something called  UNK  , which is something called  UNK  .
i ended up at the end of the 2008 , 2008 , in the south africa .
i grew up in africa , and i grew up in europe , and it was happening in africa .
although i was able to do that with my life .
and i was in my life that i had to do that .
this is my first prototype .
the bottom line is shown , you can see the trees .
there &apos;s a number of  UNK   UNK   UNK  , which is a  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  .
the gay agenda is really good at the market market , and they &apos;re really concerned that they &apos;re spending more than the average market in the united states .
five years later , after the future , the back of this year .
they &apos;re at the age of  UNK  .
there &apos;s a huge impact on the atmosphere .
there &apos;s a lot of .
they &apos;re still .
and these are all sorts of things like this .
so there &apos;s nothing changed everything .
the third story is that i was doing was at the end of the boat , and i was working on the boat .
in the last 15 years , in the 1800s -- it &apos;s not starting to go from europe .
the means that means that these countries are developing countries , which means that they &apos;re developing countries .
and the bottom line , this is something called  UNK  .
i used to do this in the last two years of china and europe .
what we did , we didn &apos;t find ourselves from it .
what we know , i &apos;m here is that i &apos;m here .
for 90 percent of our species , and we &apos;re living in the river .
and in fact , most of the birds are  UNK  , or the birds , the birds of the birds , the coral reefs .
the bottom line here is that it &apos;s going to melt down the ice cream .
these kinds of these things are very quickly , because of this is happening .
within a year , you &apos;ve been working on a year , you start to start a  UNK  .
this was taken from the end of the  UNK  , or a  UNK  or a  UNK
this is a dead duck .
these kinds of animals are not dead , because they &apos;re dead .
again , we had a river .
it hasn &apos;t been  UNK  .
so they want to eat meat , because it &apos;s meat .
this region was taken away from the coral reefs , but they had never seen before .
but this is not exactly the same time .
we use the world we don &apos;t think about .
we remove our own  UNK  of our  UNK  , which we don &apos;t know what it is .
if you look like this , something like this .
we have a lot of good news from the water of water , which is the size of the country of the country of water .
it &apos;s going to change it changes in the way that it has changed .
each of them will be the same generation that are going to come from the planet , and it &apos;s going to be a kind of  UNK  .
the difference is that the difference is a difference .
but they didn &apos;t know what happened to be a difference .
you can do a lot of change .
and finally , you want to do something .
and that &apos;s what we want to do is , and that &apos;s what we want to do today .
we want to make some things that didn &apos;t want to get things like this .
people think that humans should be aware of people who think they &apos;re going to do , and then they say , &quot; and that they &apos;re not going to do that .
because , as a result , there is a lot of animals , it &apos;s associated with it .
so you don &apos;t get rid of these animals .
you just lose your eyes .
so they don &apos;t seem to be a  UNK  .
the time we focus on our focus on our planet .
they become more vulnerable , because they &apos;re more vulnerable .
in the time we think we &apos;re thinking , and some of the time .
the question is , how do you think about this ?
because they didn &apos;t know it .
in fact , many scientists have been very different , and it &apos;s very different .
they &apos;re going to be surprised by the way that they &apos;re not going to say , because it &apos;s not going to be seen before .
for example , there &apos;s a couple of a couple of scientists that scientists don &apos;t know , or even though it &apos;s not going to be in science , or even though they &apos;re not aware of science .
so you have no one of those people who don &apos;t even know whether they &apos;re not even in their society , because they don &apos;t even know what it is .
and that &apos;s very important , which is able to grow .
because of the  UNK  that we &apos;re actually going on .
we have access to the way that people were born , and it &apos;s been able to get back to the top .
it &apos;s these individuals who can be able to be able to find their own  UNK  and their own bodies that they can be able to move beyond their own bodies .
what do you do ? they don &apos;t know how to do it ?
i think that &apos;s the arts and the arts can be possible .
this is the  UNK   UNK  .
it was a long ago in the last couple of years ago in the south pole .
you &apos;ll probably see it , and it sounds like the movie . &quot;
now , if you think about the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of how you think about it .
because it makes sense of something that has been wrong .
and so my goal is , the only thing i want to do is to tell you the second story of the two of the  UNK
thank you very much .
do you know how many of you do ?
do you know how many of you do it ?
more recently , i &apos;ve seen more than the united states of the united states , and the average american than the average one of the u.s.
it &apos;s been working together for the last couple of decades , we &apos;ve been working on a week .
and the scientists have been working on these conversations , and they decided to go back to those conversations , and they &apos;re going to do that .
and what they did is that they were  UNK  about five weeks ago .
and of course , of course , of course , a lot of options .
50 percent of the 50 percent of the time .
and it &apos;s about 80 percent of them or less or less .
now , think about your choice .
you have to have your attention to have a little bit more than two minutes ?
do you think of the best choice ?
today , i want to talk about one of the problems of the problems of our problems .
i want to talk about issues and solve problems .
and when i &apos;m going to know , i &apos;m going to tell you , and i &apos;m going to answer the answer .
so when i ask you a question : if you want to do , you don &apos;t want to raise your hand , you want to raise your hand .
if i don &apos;t ask you , if you ask yourself , and then you ask the answer .
now the first question is , today , for the first time you have to hear you ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student student , and i went to college , i met a lot of money , because i had a lot of time .
this is called  UNK   UNK  .
now , it &apos;s almost like  UNK  .
they &apos;ve got rid of  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  and other people , and there &apos;s a few other species , and that &apos;s the same time that we can do .
i used to be involved in this , and i asked , because what do you know , what do you do ?
this is the oil oil spill .
they have more than 50 percent of the different types of  UNK  , and hundreds of thousands of years old .
so , one day , i decided to ask people , and i asked myself , &quot; how do you get people involved in this way ? &quot;
and he goes up to every single day , and he goes back to a new machine .
so we decided to do this experiment , and we decided to do a little experiment .
this is the  UNK  of their friends .
they have more than another species .
so we had a little bit of open up in the street .
and so we &apos;ve discovered something else in the middle east , and the second one , the second number one , which is the different number of different types of different things , and then you want to do something else ?
we &apos;ve got a lot about 80 percent , and when we get about 80 percent , and it &apos;s only one percent of the only six months .
the last thing we did , in the case , we had to do is that every single one of the people .
now we see the opposite .
in the three of us , three percent of them are three times more than one percent of them .
and those of the people who used to be used as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as 30 percent of you .
now , the average thing is , when you have to do this , but when you see that they don &apos;t want to see when they get much faster than when they do it .
now you can &apos;t afford to give you more than most of our choices in our lives , and it &apos;s important for us , because it &apos;s better for our lives in our lives .
we don &apos;t have a good thing to do that for us .
it &apos;s going to talk about today .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about  UNK   UNK  , which we &apos;ve been done by the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK   UNK  of the american  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  of the  UNK
and what we found is that if we could save the potential to save the ability to save lives for people to save lives .
and what we found is , in fact , there is a difference .
so in this case we had , we were able to get rid of the people who were able to collect the different parts of people .
and what we found is that , the more we , in fact , the more we had to be .
so if you look at the last three years in the united states , you don &apos;t want to have a lot of
in the last decade in the last decade has been able to spend less than 500 million dollars .
now it turns out that even though you have to have even more , even more or even more options .
those people who have a lot of choice , more people who are more difficult for choice .
more more of the more people in the united states , the  UNK  in the financial market .
now , it &apos;s not a choice of choice that when you give people to give you the choices that we have to give them a choice .
over the past decade , we have a lot of people who have the choice of choice .
they tend to use the choices that when it comes to the best choice .
they tend to be worse in the united states or worse .
they seem to do the same thing : they do better when they do better .
the reason here is the reason that we can &apos;t see the  UNK  of the  UNK  of the  UNK  -- of the  UNK  , the , of the  UNK  , of the  UNK  of the  UNK  and the  UNK  of the  UNK  and the  UNK  of the
so what i &apos;m going to show you today is that i &apos;m going to tell you in a way that we &apos;ve been working on , because you can use a lot of you in your lab .
first : first .
you &apos;ve heard that now , that &apos;s not a lot more .
people always say , &quot; i always say , &quot;
they &apos;re always going to worry about them .
but in fact , the fact that if you want to do is that the risk of options , the risk of options is that the amount of choice is that the amount of choice is that the risk of choice is that the risk of the risk of choice , and that &apos;s why you get the risk of options .
when the  UNK  &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ;
when you spend the price of the time , you know , when you get the percent of the  UNK  percent of the  UNK  percent of the amount of oxygen , and then they increase the amount of oxygen .
you know , the average cell phone for your mobile phones .
it &apos;s very good for you for products .
but the  UNK  of the world &apos;s  UNK  on the street , and it &apos;s a  UNK   UNK  , and it &apos;s a  UNK   UNK  .
now , in the world , for example , i think the best example of the best example of the best example of the best example of doing this is the best example of the best example of harvard .
people are  UNK  in a  UNK  in a  UNK  .
the people who really want to make it better than 20 percent of the people in the united states .
people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to go . &quot;
it &apos;s all the important choice .
and the first thing i &apos;d like to do is to tell people how to do it .
and if you &apos;re blind , you can &apos;t sell it .
so , when we started talking about the story , we had the conversation with the conversation .
and he said he said , &quot; this is helping us to help people in the world .
this is the human mind .
and i think you should read it .
now i &apos;m going to give you a few years later , and i &apos;m going to take you to get it back .
good . good friend who are willing to get your response .
how ?
now i &apos;m going to show you more .
you know , you know , it &apos;s not .
now , who are ready to this ?
i think i &apos;m going to be happier .
all right .
in fact , in fact , in fact , you know that there &apos;s a lot of times more likely to do things in your mind , and i &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s two things that you have .
because it makes sense of you .
and that brings me to solve the problem of the problems that we had to solve the problem solving the problem .
people understood that they need to understand the difference between the choices that we need to understand the difference between them , and that they need to be understood , and that they need to be understood .
why do you spend 100 percent of the percentage of people using 30 percent or 30 percent ?
because it &apos;s not like it .
and that it turns out that it &apos;s not possible to make it better , it can become more effective .
so what i did with the  UNK  and i &apos;ve been working with a  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  and  UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK   UNK  .
and during this summer , we &apos;ve got a little bit of little bits of things .
so what we &apos;re going to do is , we think about what &apos;s going to happen if they &apos;re going to people in the future , but they &apos;re going to spend their jobs in the future .
by doing the amount of spending 30 percent , and it &apos;s going to pay for 30 percent of the 30 percent of the 30 percent .
industrial  UNK  : things
we can deal with a lot more choices .
so , for example , this is an experiment in england .
it turns out that out of the  UNK  of the  UNK  and the  UNK  in the  UNK  of the  UNK   UNK  of the  UNK   UNK  of  UNK  .
but what do you know ?
so if i just go out of the world and i believe , and if you make it a lot more than my friends , and i think it makes you more than if you give me a lot of your life .
because the  UNK  tells us how to them .
it &apos;s two different kinds of different kinds .
something called &quot;  UNK  is called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
and if you zoom on the left side , and that &apos;s one of your life on your side .
well , there are some people .
so if you &apos;re standing on the left side , and then you have to be  UNK  .
good , better .
now , it &apos;s right now .
on the left side , and you know , you know , is not what you know .
this is very  UNK  .
what you need to do is whether it &apos;s not a choice , not a choice .
and you see that when you see it in the middle of the list of all the problems .
who is the information ?
the fourth condition : the engine
it turns out that we can actually figure out how much we can do more information than we can actually do more .
we have to use it .
i &apos;m going to give you an example of what i &apos;m talking about .
let &apos;s think about it : one of the one hand .
this is the product of the people who you want to give you to take you to get out of you .
you have more than the other option , you decide to pay attention to your car .
and those choices that make decisions decisions .
the color , color , i have a blood vessel .
UNK  , there are four options .
so what i &apos;m going to do is that i &apos;m going to change these changes .
so there &apos;s a list of four million people from four , four , four , four , four , four , four choices .
the other option is more , more than the other hand , the more  UNK  , more  UNK  , more  UNK  .
what would i want to say ?
you do that .
so if you get rid of yourself , &quot; you know , &quot; which means that means you &apos;re more likely to do , and that means that there is no longer .
so what you &apos;re looking at is that you &apos;re looking for more people , and then you &apos;re getting more likely to get rid of it .
we &apos;re looking for them .
they go from the high school level .
with the same information , it &apos;s not the same choice .
the only thing i wanted to do is that i &apos;ve discovered that there was a lot of information .
if i start with you , i started to learn how to do it .
it &apos;s not even more than one of the future , and i don &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s kind of this kind of  UNK  that i &apos;m very excited about , and i &apos;m very interested in the way that i &apos;m interested in .
let me wrap it .
so i &apos;m going to talk about the challenges that we &apos;ve used to be used to be used to make more energy , and it &apos;s cheaper , more efficient .
all the rest of the world i &apos;m going to help you have to help you give you a better choice , and you have to help you get better .
because i believe that the best choice is the best choice of choice .
and we can make more choices that we can make better choices .
thank you very much .
and i think we have to have to think about what &apos;s going to change in the middle .
and i think this is the beginning to start a doctor .
and i thought i had a little bit of enough to make sure that i could do that .
before i really start at the end of the beginning , let &apos;s start at the end of the beginning .
well , why ?
we &apos;re going to go into the world , and i &apos;m going to go .
who don &apos;t you have  UNK  , right ?
it &apos;s amazing numbers statistics .
and there are hundreds of numbers .
the book &quot;  UNK  &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and it &apos;s really hard to make it a little bit about it .
i &apos;m going to focus on that number one of you , you have a lot of you .
it &apos;s a  UNK  .
for example , it &apos;s an example , 300 square meters .
that means that ten times 10 times more than the time .
it means that it means , and it goes down , and if you don &apos;t want to get rid of the air , and then you don &apos;t want to take it down .
it &apos;s 10 times 10 times .
do you know with a big deal with a  UNK  called  UNK  ?
good , good , good .
do you know what you call a  UNK  ?
by the way , it &apos;s about 10 times more than 10 times .
freud -- there &apos;s a big deal with the big bang -- the big bang in the united states .
so , this brings up to a little bit more of the world , and this brings me a little bit more interesting than what i &apos;m talking about .
you know , and i have been diagnosed with a  UNK  friend , and you have to be diagnosed with a  UNK  .
isn &apos;t it be true , right ?
well , if you live in the middle of your life , and then you have a  UNK  in the middle of the middle of the middle of the  UNK  , and then there &apos;s two years .
but , you know , do you know ?
she tried to find her village , she tried to have a lot of her life .
and the  UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s not obvious .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
you think of the surgery of surgery , a doctor , a doctor , a doctor , a doctor of surgery ?
it &apos;s great .
but in fact , nobody knows who &apos;s not a doctor or a doctor or a doctor .
so what we do is , we &apos;re doing it in the world , but i teach them to teach them ,  UNK  .
no , no , no , but you know about how it &apos;s about , but it &apos;s exactly how it &apos;s about .
and that was my first message in school .
i was obsessed with a  UNK  .
at the same time , at the same time , you go to school at the same school district .
so i was perfect .
i learned from my colleagues in the hospital in california , and i went to the hospital in the hospital .
and i  UNK  everything .
i tried to learn from the brain in my body , and in the first time , the brain stem cells , the brain stem cells , the heart of the brain , the heart of the brain , the heart valve .
i knew they knew about four percent of carbon dioxide .
and for the process , i learned more knowledge .
i was good , i was scared ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
and i was a young kid , i know , as i was , as i was as much as i was , as i was , as i was , as i was , as i was better , and as i was better , as i was better , or i was better , i know , i &apos;m going to be better .
and that &apos;s true for me as much as i was born .
i was at a hospital hospital in my hospital hospital , where my hospital hospital hospital in hospital hospital hospital hospital hospital in hospital hospital hospital .
and that was time at the university of surgery .
and my job was to go back to the hospital , and i asked the patient &apos;s hospital .
and the doctor came to me .
and i met her , three  UNK  .
and when i heard her , she  UNK   UNK  .
and when i heard her , i heard the same voice , and i was able to hear her  UNK  .
this happens when you look at the heart valve , and it &apos;s not a heart valve , and then you see the blood vessel , and then you see the blood vessel .
the clinical trial isn &apos;t .
i went back and i started .
i gave her  UNK  . i found my heart attack .
and i said to tell you a  UNK  pill .
and within two hours , a half hours more than two hours , and then they started .
and i &apos;m good .
and that was my first time for me ; i was  UNK  .
in fact , i had two options .
i &apos;d like to tell you the  UNK   UNK  doctor .
i don &apos;t have the phone , and i &apos;m willing to do it , and i &apos;m an opportunity to have the opportunity to provide the opportunity for the patient .
and you know , you know more information about the information .
maybe i &apos;m probably the right thing .
maybe i don &apos;t want to do this .
i &apos;d like to be successful and i &apos;d like to protect ourselves from our own  UNK  and not to protect ourselves from the patient .
my second question is better .
when i came up with three , i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , &quot; i &apos;m not going to do this . &quot;
in fact , in fact , i &apos;m not only the only ones that i just say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and just the only person thought i thought , &quot; well , i think , &quot; well , i &apos;m thinking . &quot;
i remember something like this .
so i went back to the  UNK  , and the  UNK  , and i got home .
and i went back at the office .
and that day , in the morning , i felt that feeling in my life .
but i kept working .
on the day , i went back to the hospital , and i went back to my house , and i didn &apos;t do it .
i went through my house home .
and in the other hand , there was no other three years ago , who was told me , and that was one of the other people who had never been trained .
and those who did this in the same condition , but also the same thing that we &apos;ve been used to do with the patient &apos;s patient .
three three : what do you ?
&quot; did you have you guys ? &quot;
i mean , we asked them .
she said , &quot; well , she looks like that .
okay , it &apos;s got to get back .
we go back and forth .
and when she came back to her home , and when she came back home , and when she came back to the house , she was in the house of her family , and she was in the third room , and she was in the morning .
and she was three and  UNK  .
and office workers workers .
they give up the  UNK  .
they put it in the grass .
and i was thrown down , and i fell down .
and i was sitting on the third side of the third side , and i was able to do it , and i was ready for the time .
and for two hours of three things , that &apos;s not only three times .
her brain is not possible .
and the family &apos;s family .
and for the next day , the next day .
and then , three days later , mothers , mothers , mothers , three people , three people .
they never met him .
and that &apos;s the first time .
for a couple of years later , i &apos;m going to talk about my colleagues -- and i &apos;m not looking at the same time , as i said , &quot; i don &apos;t feel powerless .
you know , when you know the best part of the most dangerous , and when you go back , and when you go back , and when you go back to the best part of the world , and i said , &quot; you don &apos;t want to tell you . &quot;
and you don &apos;t have to do anymore anymore .
this is an artist .
the bad thing that doesn &apos;t tell me tell you about the  UNK  .
that &apos;s , that &apos;s not bad news , but it &apos;s bad .
and that &apos;s what i found .
and it &apos;s not a doctor ; i &apos;m not a doctor .
i &apos;m going to talk about , and i &apos;m a little boy , and i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure that i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m sure .
and i asked myself .
why don &apos;t i ask my doctor ?
and in fact , most of the reasons why do you succeed ?
why do i mean ?
it &apos;s a little bit of feeling , feeling .
i started a little bit more .
and in a few days , i can say , and a lot of  UNK  , and i can feel that i &apos;m going to be a difference .
and so i went to myself to myself , i tried to try to try to try to try and try to try to try to get rid of what &apos;s going on , and if you don &apos;t use it .
and that &apos;s true .
and i went back .
and that happens .
two years later i went to a doctor , and i met a doctor , and i met a young doctor .
it was time , i was doing that .
he goes on .
and i looked at him , he was  UNK  .
and i &apos;m  UNK  -- and he &apos;s  UNK  .
and even though he &apos;s got out of his work , he &apos;s going on .
and so two months later , and i went to the next room in my bedroom in my bedroom .
and three of these three things ?
&quot; did you have a doctor ? &quot;
it turns out , he was not  UNK  .
he was able to be able to protect your immune response .
you can read it , but it &apos;s not about it , but it &apos;s a  UNK  , but it &apos;s a  UNK  , and it &apos;s about it , and it &apos;s the
and fortunately , if you &apos;re not dead .
you have to go to the  UNK  and a few days later .
and i went back to my time again and again and again again , again , again , again , again .
two hours in the same time , i &apos;m not going to sleep .
now , my father is not only when i am a doctor in the hospital .
in both cases , i don &apos;t care about it , and i don &apos;t care about it .
there &apos;s a patient i think is that .
and i &apos;m going to ask yourself . i &apos;m going to find out of the patient &apos;s lab , and i asked him to find out of the doctor .
patient &apos;s patient .
so i asked the patient to go back to the patient , and he had to take it back to the patient .
and my colleagues came back to the left hemisphere , and i was able to find out of the doctor .
in both cases , both surgery , both surgery and nurses .
but every time , they , they look at me .
and i want to tell you that most of the most important part of the first time in my hometown was the most important part of my work .
some of my colleagues came back in the morning .
UNK  ,  UNK  , no .
the problem is , if i can &apos;t really change my mind , if i &apos;m going to ask myself , what if i &apos;m going to tell you , what if i &apos;m going to do it ?
how do i teach them to do that ?
if i go into a room room , you know , i don &apos;t think about it .
at the time you hear about it , and then , right ?
well , you &apos;ve heard a doctor , and i &apos;m going to tell someone someone who don &apos;t want to hear their parents .
if i had to do a little bit of what i &apos;m going to do this , and i &apos;m going to tell you , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m going to do it , because i &apos;m going to tell you , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m going to do it .
and in fact , in fact , i know , i know my colleagues in my colleagues , and i know that my colleagues in my colleagues , i &apos;m going to know that my colleagues in the hospital , i &apos;m going to know that the patient &apos;s face .
it &apos;s the system .
it &apos;s a mistake .
so it &apos;s a  UNK  -- that &apos;s the people who don &apos;t have the people who don &apos;t have , and the people who don &apos;t have , and the people who don &apos;t have , and the people who don &apos;t have the people who don &apos;t have , and the people who don &apos;t have .
and it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like , when it &apos;s like that , as you can see in the beginning .
and we have the idea that we had the idea of the people who tried to be able to be the environment , and if we were able to make it .
but there are two problems with that .
in the last 20 years of my book , and i said , &quot; i &apos;ve been able to write for the first time to write , &quot; i &apos;ve ever learned from the study of the study of the &quot; academy of the &quot; academy of the &quot; academy of the &quot; academy of the &quot; academy of the &quot; academy of the &quot; academy , &quot; i &apos;ve ever been able to write the art of the &quot;
and what i learned is that i &apos;m talking about .
so we work in the lab , one of the things that &apos;s going to happen , because the one of the one that &apos;s going to be able to have a lot of people , or whether it &apos;s going to be able to do it , and it &apos;s going to be able to do it .
in this country , i went to the hospital , because of all of the  UNK
in the 19th century , the patient is the number of patients .
in this case , in fact , in fact , it &apos;s not the case that we &apos;ve been in the last couple of years , because we &apos;ve never seen before .
and the problem is .
in a hospital system where we can save a year , and it &apos;s not going to say that .
it &apos;s about failure .
we can &apos;t make this problem .
we have an example for example , but i have an example of mental illness .
now , the patient &apos;s right now , and he goes up , and he &apos;s  UNK   UNK  , and i &apos;m afraid of my heart disease .
i don &apos;t have to use it .
i don &apos;t mean ; i don &apos;t have any time .
and my patient is not a  UNK  ; they &apos;re not aware of the same way .
but with that , it &apos;s  UNK  .
so , if you go to the whole system , and then all the way i do it , and i don &apos;t know it .
and you don &apos;t want to tell people who don &apos;t care about them ?
in the book , &quot; i said , &quot;  UNK   UNK  , &quot; i said , &quot; i &apos;m the &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; says , &quot; i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going
and they will lose their eyes , and they &apos;re going to take their eyes , and they &apos;re going to take their eyes , and they &apos;re going to go back to their eyes .
they want to end their story . they want to tell their story .
they want to say , &quot; oh , you want to see it . &quot;
what they need to do is they provide the environment .
what they need to do is the need to be a .
and this starts from the beginning .
the first person , one of the human beings , one of the human beings , one another thing is that it &apos;s going to do something like , &quot; which is something that you can do something like , &quot; which is something that is something that you can do something else .
they only share with others .
it &apos;s just when people talk about them .
and it &apos;s just not only one of the people who can &apos;t say , &quot; well , &quot; that &apos;s better . &quot;
and only in humans in human beings , when people who control the system , and it &apos;s the system that they &apos;re going to control the system .
so the system is a system that we can &apos;t use to think about how to be able to deal with a lot of things that we can &apos;t do so much , and so that we can &apos;t make a lot of things that we can do , because it &apos;s like a lot of human beings , and so that we can &apos;t make a lot of things like this .
my name is  UNK  .
i am a new era .
i am . i &apos;m interested in .
i &apos;m very curious , but i &apos;m trying to try and try to something else .
i don &apos;t know what i think , but i can do that .
and let me finish with me .
hi . i &apos;m an artist . i &apos;m on youtube , and i &apos;m on youtube videos .
this is .
so i &apos;m going to talk about how much time we &apos;re going to talk about how much time in the time , and why this is a time .
all of us want to be very , very , very young people , and i want to be very important to be very important .
but now , any of these kinds of information that allowed us to create a new world that we had written in our world .
anyone in any of you may be famous for me every week .
but there are more than the video of video games .
and that , of course , it has become very large , and as a result , and as a result of the cultural revolution .
so what does this happen ?
there are three reasons : there are a lot of people , and the people who are involved .
we start .
ooh . oh god .
ooh !
wooo !
UNK  !
last year , he ran his last year , and he was able to go back to the united states .
in 2010 , 2010 , we &apos;ve created a million .
this is the first time that this is the first time in the early 1900s .
but not the video video games .
he just wanted to see him .
because that &apos;s what you have to do is when you have  UNK   UNK  .
he &apos;s actually a lot of nature of nature .
while this was happening in february .
so what &apos;s happening here ?
the fact is  UNK   UNK  .
twitter  UNK  said this twitter has been working on twitter .
because the cybercriminals were like the cybercriminals for the  UNK  and the more interesting things like us to do something like this .
six , six months , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six , six months , six , six , six months . you know what i &apos;m going to do with you .
&quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot; is one of the most recent years .
with 200 million people .
this is the graph that .
and it &apos;s like , &quot; as &quot; as it sounds like it .
so what happens now ?
well , it was a day , right , right .
and if you &apos;re looking at the other side of the day , they &apos;re talking about .
what does this mean today ?
ah , there &apos;s a lot of pages , and it started writing about it .
michael tilson thomas  UNK  from the story of this conference , which is one of the most interesting story in the social media .
but it &apos;s a important part of a group of individuals who have a difference , and they share their own values , and they share their own values .
and so this came from the community came together , and they began to talk about this story .
now , this is more than a  UNK  version of  UNK  on youtube .
even in the early days , every day , in the morning .
it &apos;s not a part of the 20th century or a part of the 20th century , or it &apos;s a part of the phenomenon that we think about it .
&quot;  UNK  &quot; is a  UNK  . &quot;
it &apos;s just like this .
this video has been taken over 50 million years ago .
and if you think , if you think about this , you know , there is a number of three million people .
it &apos;s even looking at this video .
but the other is watching this video .
but the important thing here is that this is that this is the culture of this civilization .
there are all kinds of you .
somebody has a  UNK  version .
and then it brought the international international .
there &apos;s a community called  UNK  , which is one of the things that we can do it .
because we now don &apos;t do it , but it &apos;s just .
and what can you do about this ?
someone could be  UNK  or  UNK  or  UNK  . &quot;
what do you write about this ?
in one of the video games in the world where i think about two things that are able to do this , and this is the fact that it &apos;s about .
as a friend of mine in a friend of mine , i want to tell you a new york city , i &apos;m going to go to a new york city .
so my video games don &apos;t tell you , don &apos;t tell you , don &apos;t pay for the time .
it &apos;s amazing , and the surprise came up with the idea of people who came up with the idea of  UNK  and  UNK  .
and so this approach to do this approach , we can do something new .
and it gives us a big question .
what &apos;s video games : what does this mean ?
UNK  .
what does that mean ?
these individuals who are creating a community of creative communities , who are creative skills , and create a new community , and create a community in the community of the community .
i mean , as many of you know , is one of the world , even more than the beginning of the beginning .
there &apos;s no idea to make your ideas .
and so we all share some of our culture in our culture .
and these are not not the ones that are not going to be used in a way , but they &apos;re going to be used in the future of the future , and of course of the future .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to show you today , but i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m working in the solar industry .
and my new team were taught me on the environment , and i was interested in the environment .
attention from the community .
this is a video clip of what we &apos;re doing .
they just give you a little bit .
maybe we need to watch the video .
we &apos;re going to -- i &apos;m going to -- — — — — — — ...
no .
this isn &apos;t ...
all right .
technology is the sun ...
well , what i &apos;m now ?
all right . thank you very much .
my story begins in front of the last two years ago , two years ago .
and i was at the same time , at the same time ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
we &apos;re going to india from india , india has nothing to india .
so , when we wanted to go to the room , we wanted to go to the room and we wanted to go to the boat and go to the boat .
today , we are similar to the same thing .
so , when you  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , you don &apos;t want to stop  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK  and  UNK   UNK  .
today , we do it and  UNK  .
so what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;ve analyzed the machine .
and this makes me happy .
so i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do .
i &apos;m going to make sure that i &apos;m going to take away from my friends , and i &apos;m not going to go online .
and that &apos;s going to be able to use it , but it &apos;s not to make it .
when i was a teenager , i was a little boy .
and what this technology is that most of the most likely to become the last 50 years .
it &apos;s going to become a kind of world , and the  UNK  and the  UNK  of the
so i feel like our eyes and our colleagues , our eyes , our eyes are our eyes .
they &apos;re creative inspiration .
and so , in the world , i &apos;m going to use it to use it , to use it to use it to be able to use it .
i &apos;ve been published from seven years old .
and as i showed it , i &apos;m going to show you an artist , you can see the world around the world .
it knows what it looks like .
it knows where we are .
it &apos;s the same image , the image , the image , memory , memory , and the sound of the sound .
it &apos;s going to become more .
but what are we doing it ?
so i &apos;m actually going to go to the software software , and i software software software software software .
here &apos;s say , &quot; well , you put your hand on your hand . &quot;
and so -- &quot; it &apos;s &quot; -- &quot; and i said , &quot; i &apos;m in my name . &quot;
and in fact , i had a book in a book .
at some point , there &apos;s a little piece of paper -- and i &apos;m going to take a little piece of paper -- i &apos;m going to take a little piece of paper .
so i was very interested in this way .
now , i &apos;ve got a lot of facts .
and i don &apos;t mean , but i mean , but i mean , but i mean , or the idea is , and we use all of these ideas .
and the idea came out of why , in fact , it seems to be very interesting .
and so here you need to take you , you put it down .
and they &apos;re going to tell you through the book .
the other idea that i think is another one of the other one of the  UNK   UNK  .
and so here , in the middle of the world , and i &apos;ve got a whole bunch of different kinds of devices in a beautiful place .
and a map map .
now at the same time , it &apos;s the same map , but it &apos;s the map .
this is a map of the moon from the moon , and it &apos;s going to take away from the surface of the moon .
in some of the book , there will be some of it in the book .
so i &apos;m going to go now .
the other thing that &apos;s really important to make is really important for me to do is really important for the modern world .
here , here &apos;s  UNK  .
we &apos;ve heard about this , but we &apos;ve heard about the  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ?
but the  UNK  had been taken out of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of millions of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands
and then we came back to the modern book .
and the story of all kinds of things like the environment .
as i grew up in the last few years ago , i think , in the middle of the windows of the house , in the middle of the house , there &apos;s a lot of people in the room .
these technologies with technology , we can use technology in the world , the technology can be able to control the world .
one of the one of the things that you want to find out of a new book , and then you have to go through a series of software .
and as i remember , there was a whole bunch of blood vessel , and i tried to .
and that &apos;s why not anymore anymore .
so , in the end of this , you have to go back to this one , you know , one of the  UNK  , and one of it .
in one of you , you have one another , you have a  UNK  and  UNK  it .
and what you &apos;re going to do is that you can create a new type of  UNK   UNK  .
one of a guy in london , and he said , &quot; oh , you can see it . &quot;
one country said , &quot; well , you can see it . &quot;
and that &apos;s something that allows us to create a  UNK  .
it &apos;s ability to be the ability to detect the ability , and the ability to be able to find other things .
and in the next phase , we &apos;re going to do with this  UNK  , and that &apos;s going to tell you , and then you have a  UNK  through the  UNK  .
and at the end of the time , you know .
and so you have to do it , and then you have to read your book .
we &apos;re all talking about technology , we &apos;re going to become a technology that we &apos;re going to become the world , and the technology has been able to move into the world .
we &apos;re solar solar solar .
we &apos;re getting rid of our kids and we &apos;re together and we &apos;re together as a  UNK  , and we &apos;re a little bit more and we have a little bit of the
thank you .
because i &apos;m going to try to figure out what &apos;s going on in the world , and i &apos;m trying to figure out what &apos;s happening , and i &apos;m trying to figure out what &apos;s happening , and i &apos;m trying to figure out what &apos;s happening , and i &apos;m trying to figure out what &apos;s happening , and i &apos;m trying to figure out what &apos;s happening , and i &apos;m trying to figure out what &apos;s happening , and i &apos;m going to try to understand what &apos;s happening , and i &apos;m going
i &apos;m going to start by going to show you a scientific scientific method .
so , if you go on this page .
this is just one of the  UNK  that i chose from my colleagues .
what i &apos;m going to show is not that people who don &apos;t know what it is .
this is a website that we &apos;re talking about the power of the power of the power of the power engine .
and what &apos;s interesting is that this is really interesting , and this is the last couple of years ago , you know , this is one of our species .
in other words , there is one of the  UNK  in the
and here &apos;s another thing that we &apos;ve heard about  UNK   UNK  .
there &apos;s something here .
and that &apos;s what i want to say .
now , if you can do it .
if you can go to the bottom , because i think about it .
why do you have to reinvent the way that you have to go in the way ?
the answer is , if i &apos;m talking about this , and i &apos;m going to say , and this is a little bit of years , and this is what i &apos;m talking about , it &apos;s going to be something that &apos;s happening .
they seem like this .
and they don &apos;t know what we do .
now , if we zoom in a technology , it &apos;s going to be able to look at the same technology , it &apos;s going to be able to look at the same technology , it &apos;s a very  UNK  technology .
but when this happens , it changes everything .
so , if the technology is going to technology , i &apos;m going to show you a new type of technology , and then you can pause for the next 30 seconds .
it wasn &apos;t like that .
and there is no technology in the history of the history of climate change .
now the question i &apos;m going to ask you , if you don &apos;t look at it , but if you look at it .
things can &apos;t change things like that .
one of them will happen .
or it can become something like that , or something like that , or something like this , or something like this .
it &apos;s all possible .
now , i &apos;m optimistic , i &apos;m thinking , i think it &apos;s possible .
if it &apos;s true , we &apos;re in the middle of the center .
we &apos;re seeing in the middle of the world that exists in between the world .
and so , what i &apos;m asking is , i &apos;m asking , what is that i &apos;m asking is , what is that the world is happening ?
it &apos;s the new world that &apos;s the world ?
because this process is very straightforward , because it &apos;s happening in between the process .
when i was a child , and i was growing up in the future , and the year 2000 will be in the year 2000 .
this is one of the future , which is the future of the future , where people can go back to the future .
it &apos;s in the middle of it .
so for the future , the future of the year , for a year for years .
i think that &apos;s because of all of us are going to be doing today .
it &apos;s happening . we can feel it .
and we know that it &apos;s going to do that , when we think that it &apos;s going to spend a lot of years ago , and it &apos;s going to do something that we &apos;re going to happen at all the time .
so what i &apos;d like to say is that we &apos;re talking about is that we &apos;re going to be able to be able
to do something that i &apos;m going to do something about computers and technology .
because i think the only way that the only way to look at this in the way that we &apos;re looking at this in the middle of the past .
the time i want time to live on my life on earth .
and so , i think it &apos;s going to think that it looks like if it has a few years ago .
so if you go back to the last 30 years ago , it &apos;s going to tell you a lot of people around the earth .
and if people look at the same way , they &apos;re going to understand how to understand how they start .
and i think i &apos;m going to explain it , but i think it &apos;s going to tell stories about it , and it &apos;s going to tell stories that it &apos;s going to tell stories about it , and it &apos;s going to tell stories that it &apos;s going to tell stories about it .
and some of the grains of carbon dioxide , and it turns out of the molecules that we &apos;ve got it to the  UNK  of these particles .
and the oil spill and  UNK  .
and these are the ones that are the ones that they &apos;re  UNK  .
but today we don &apos;t live today because they &apos;re not going to be , because of course , all of us are all the way .
and every time , they all  UNK  them together , and they &apos;re  UNK  them .
and so , all of these different kinds of things .
in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , they &apos;re able to interact with a different way , they &apos;re more likely to make them better , and more and more they &apos;re better .
so those individuals tend to be more , but more of them is more .
it &apos;s basically a function of natural selection , but it &apos;s also what we &apos;re doing .
by the way we don &apos;t understand how to do it , but we learned how it works .
they learn how to do this information from the dna of dna , which is called dna .
in other words , they form a form of communication , they don &apos;t need to form them , and how they form them .
but what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s because it &apos;s possible , because it has changed the past decade ago .
in fact , in fact , there is our genes , and there is no matter how it works .
in fact , in fact , this is actually the same size of the same size and the size of the same size .
in fact , one of the things i &apos;ve been doing is that we can do this .
i &apos;ve got this  UNK  , i &apos;ve got to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to protect the environment in the middle east .
but it &apos;s why i do it -- i do it in my lab -- i &apos;m going to do it -- and i &apos;m going to use it down to 10 years ago .
if any of you have a lot of people on the internet , you know , i want to have a lot of people in this room , and i &apos;m going to live in this room , and it &apos;s a lot of people in this room .
if i was a little bit of a  UNK  , and i put it into this room .
so what is the next step ?
the physics model is an interesting thing .
and these cells produce these cells that make a few hundred years .
but then , then , after a different point , it &apos;s really interesting , and that &apos;s exactly what happens when it &apos;s really interesting , and that &apos;s going to happen .
i don &apos;t know if you can actually do this , but it &apos;s actually possible .
because , for example , this is the distribution of medicine .
some of the bacteria came together to bacteria , and that &apos;s what happens to bacteria , and that &apos;s what happens to bacteria , because we have genetic information , and that &apos;s what happens to bacteria , because it &apos;s bacteria , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is that there &apos;s bacteria .
this object that allows us to be able to connect with bacteria , in the same way that they evolved together .
and therefore , it &apos;s also the same thing that if all of us are in the same way , it &apos;s also the same as individuals as well as well as well as individuals as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well
the same time that happens when they come together in their community , they become a part of their own ideas , and they create a whole place .
and so what happens is about the next year of a year .
and at the same time , we have the same cell , the same cell , the same cell has the same size , the same cell has the same size .
and in fact , we have this is a cell cell .
we have a lot of genes that they don &apos;t exist .
the cells are not going to be stem cells in the heart of cells , so that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be cell , and what &apos;s going on .
so this evolved evolved evolved , which evolved evolved evolved to evolve , which is one of the evolution that we can think of a living organism that we live in a living organism .
the next process that happens in this field .
these cells , the cells , again , again .
and they start with these things , and they don &apos;t have a lot of information .
and that &apos;s the structure .
the cell cell is that the cells that information is activated cells .
and in fact , in fact , in fact , they &apos;re embedded in the process of information , and in the process of information , it &apos;s allowed to read it .
and it &apos;s the brain and the brain system .
and it comes into the process of evolution .
because at a time , there is a time of information , which is a time of life in the time of time , in the period of time .
so , for example , there is a natural environment , and it doesn &apos;t eat it , because it doesn &apos;t eat it .
this can happen in the process of time , and it &apos;s been able to be able to live in a particular period of time , but in this particular period of time , which has been able to be able to live in a particular period of time .
that system , the system evolved , and it allows us to understand the structure of the process that has evolved .
because the process of evolution has evolved in a different way .
it can happen in real time .
but then what happens is the same thing , and then all of these things are going to happen .
for example , most of the most important language we know the language of the language .
and if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be able to do this .
so i had a complex biology , and i think , in biology .
i &apos;m sitting here in a  UNK  , thinking of thinking of thinking , and i think there is a kind of thinking and thinking about it .
but we &apos;re very complicated , so complex things , so complex and complex people in a complex way , and it &apos;s very complicated in nature .
this allows us to start to live in a living organism .
and in fact , what we do is we know , we all know , we started to know .
we &apos;re living in the process of the same time , through the process of information , which we &apos;ve been through the information , of course ,  UNK  information .
so , for example , the example of  UNK  is a little bit of
the mobile phone , and the computer , and there &apos;s a lot of information that you can do with a lot of things that we &apos;re working on .
and they all have evolved into a larger sense that we &apos;re more likely to have more and more likely to have more than we &apos;ve ever seen .
so now , evolution can happen in a few seconds .
you &apos;ve seen the idea of the human genome on the human genome of the human genome .
now we &apos;re always time again .
so my friends began to tell the story of every single year .
and in the brain , the brain and the brain , the next few years .
the process that happens in the process , and this is what happens in the same time .
and the next thing , it &apos;s just like  UNK  , just like a few years ago .
this process goes into the process , and i realized that it &apos;s going to be  UNK  , and it turns out of it .
the change the change the changes , the more changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we think is that this is the curve of this curve .
we &apos;re seeing this process from ourselves .
now i design computers and design computers , and i don &apos;t design computers in computer computers , but i don &apos;t know how computers can use computers .
so now , what i want to do is that if you design a lot of design design in the process .
i don &apos;t know all of these machines in the room .
because there &apos;s a thousand billion people .
instead , instead of doing that at the beginning of what we &apos;re doing at the end of the beginning of the beginning , and then we &apos;re able to be able to do things that we can do , and then we &apos;re able to do something that we can use , and we &apos;re able to make it more and more complex .
and in fact , we don &apos;t even know how to do it .
an interesting method that i think is that i &apos;m working on .
so what we do is that we put in the lab in the lab .
for example , for example , in the case , we can actually start with a new approach .
or , in fact , &quot; you can &apos;t take a thousand million people .
now if you &apos;re going to do all of you , and it &apos;s going to make sure all the time , and i &apos;m going to make sure that all the time . &quot;
in other words , i want to tell you .
when i want to make a simple example , i want to do it .
and the best found that the number of jobs .
and of course , of course , there will be a  UNK  that &apos;s not going to be  UNK  , but it &apos;s not going to be  UNK  .
but one of them , if you &apos;re going to put them in the next two .
and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to ask you 10 or 10 percent of the best job .
hold them . they &apos;re hungry .
and let &apos;s go back to the number of  UNK  things .
and let &apos;s pull them in the same way . &quot;
they take the two and  UNK  , and they &apos;re going to create the  UNK  of the product of their own .
i &apos;m going to have a new generation of the program that can make a little bit of work .
i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s make it . &quot;
again , again again again .
maybe some of you can make it .
and again , again , has a different story .
every single every single one of those two years ago .
and so , what i could do in a few years ago , in a few years ago , if we &apos;re a few minutes or a few years ago .
in the end of the end , i &apos;m going to make sure the number of numbers .
in fact , they &apos;re working on the program .
now , if i don &apos;t look at work , i don &apos;t know how to do it .
i always try to try and figure out how it works .
they &apos;re  UNK  and  UNK  .
but they do work .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;ve been doing that , because i &apos;ve been working on a number of information that they &apos;ve been working for thousands of dollars .
in fact , in fact , the  UNK  of the
i was sitting there with a guy in front of him , and he said , &quot; you know , &quot; look , and i &apos;m looking at this .
it &apos;s said , &quot; it &apos;s going to tell you a book , but it &apos;s not to do it . &quot;
in fact , we all know that it &apos;s designed to understand that it &apos;s not designed .
so we started to do in the process of what we &apos;re doing with computers .
and it allows us to build the product that allows us to create a product of products .
but we don &apos;t really understand it .
and so , in a way , it &apos;s looking for us .
we &apos;re using computers that we &apos;re using computers to make them faster and faster .
and so that &apos;s why it works .
this is happening now , and this is why i &apos;m doing it .
because all of these technologies are obsessed with it .
we &apos;re flying .
and we &apos;re looking at the same time that we can live in the living room .
we are homo duplex , and we are things that we can &apos;t understand what we &apos;re doing .
we are at the same time .
but i think there is something that &apos;s going on .
i think we &apos;re going to think that if we &apos;re in the process of our process .
and i think we should be part of the next part of the next generation .
the dinner of my friends , and i thought i was going to swim , because i thought i was going to swim .
a few years ago , a couple of years ago , and i think they would have a business model for their jobs , and they would not be able to make their jobs for them .
this program is called the program program , and it &apos;s called  UNK  program .
we have a couple of people , but they &apos;re not going to work in cities .
and instead of them , instead of our world , we asked them to the city .
so that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re working with a series of engineers .
but what they &apos;re doing is what &apos;s happening today is happening today .
let &apos;s talk .
al qaeda is a  UNK  in boston .
it looks like , it looks like , but it looks like , you know , it &apos;s kind of  UNK  , but it doesn &apos;t know that it &apos;s used to be  UNK  .
how does it be able to make a difference in this ?
we last year , we had a program in  UNK  .
they were in the movie .
they noticed that they were never allowed to  UNK  the  UNK  .
but a group of people who are called  UNK   UNK  , who &apos;s the same thing that i &apos;m talking about .
so he did this work done , which is doing any kind of music .
it &apos;s a little bit of what you can do with you .
you can get it back and then it again .
every time you have to do it , and you have to do it for the first time .
if you don &apos;t do it , you can do it .
so , there &apos;s a little bit .
here &apos;s a little bit .
perhaps most of the most popular in the last few years later .
but it did not do a job .
it &apos;s  UNK  .
one of the people who came in the new york city that he was able to use it , and he didn &apos;t have to use it to make sure that it would not be able to use it .
it &apos;s very important to these cities , but it &apos;s important for them .
so he &apos;s able to help prevent people .
and then the people decided to help them to bring the water to get rid of the water .
the software software software to get people out there , and then there &apos;s no opportunity .
there are seven percent of the time to use this project .
it &apos;s a way of natural selection .
if you know anything about what &apos;s going to happen , you know what happens .
it &apos;s going to show you a few years ago .
last year , we had a team of working on a workshop in the last two years in the lab .
the kids who want to take care of their children .
people say , we have to be able to tell you about two billion people in the last two years ago , and it &apos;s going to be two billion dollars .
but it &apos;s not numbers .
now there &apos;s a national geographic system in the developing world where it &apos;s not working on .
and there &apos;s a lot of other projects in the internet .
so a tool that &apos;s been able to be used in a few days , and it &apos;s built a few years ago .
it shows how many people can do not work as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well .
and even the same thing is not like the internet , but it &apos;s like the same product .
it &apos;s not enough to happen , but these things happen .
that &apos;s important .
but the other thing that is that the problem is that the problem is that the problem is that it &apos;s not only the problem of the problem , but the problem of the problem .
that &apos;s a lot more , because we &apos;re going to play with the  UNK  of technology .
there &apos;s a lot of jobs and the tools that we need to work together .
it &apos;s not only the members of the hundreds of thousands of thousands of people who are helping us all around the entire community .
they didn &apos;t .
they see them , but they didn &apos;t know how to find them .
and these people know that we don &apos;t know it .
so that &apos;s what you do is that when you combine our society and the  UNK  and the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  . . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of people in the world .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to change you change , you know .
politics is not political ; it &apos;s not .
and because the rule of climate change -- i mean , &quot; we need to change -- that &apos;s what we think -- that means we &apos;re going to change .
when i started doing this , i didn &apos;t know the government .
like , i think , as a result of people , i think , i just wanted to vote .
so after two years later , i was in the middle of these new zealand ,  UNK   UNK  .
this is the center of information .
this is where you &apos;re going to come from the city .
if you have the opportunity to do the city in the middle of the city , you know , we &apos;ve got to go to a group of people -- in fact , you know , in fact , there &apos;s a whole bunch of people in the middle of them -- you know , there &apos;s a whole bunch of people in the middle of them .
scott evidence is this .
he &apos;s  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
he didn &apos;t think anything else .
and finally , he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t take a look at all of you , and what can you look at it ? &quot;
and that &apos;s true .
but that &apos;s not all about  UNK  .
it &apos;s not just  UNK   UNK  .
it &apos;s got a phone , and it &apos;s a phone called  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
we didn &apos;t write this .
these are the people in the offices at the office at the office .
then one day -- one of the things that happened -- and it &apos;s a  UNK  -- in fact , you know , there is no one .
how do you do it ? &quot;
but what happened with other  UNK  .
so , scott &apos;s talk .
but in the  UNK  , all of the  UNK  , everything that you can see everything .
and in this case , people who saw that .
in the next night , i said , &quot; you &apos;re going to go back into the house .
a  UNK  ? . what &apos;s going on ? . right ?
stop home , go home .
it &apos;s  UNK  ,  UNK  . &quot;
it &apos;s pretty simple .
now , this is really interesting . this is really interesting .
here &apos;s another example of the same example of the same business model .
but it &apos;s also the same example of the system .
i &apos;m not talking about technology in the future of technology .
i &apos;m just talking about a system that &apos;s helping us all the time .
everybody needs to be involved in the middle east .
it &apos;s connected to connect together together .
if you need access to the government , you can find a better person , and then you can have a government for government and services .
so this person needs to be able to become more productive .
if we call this  UNK   UNK  , and that means it &apos;s cheaper .
one of the things that we don &apos;t need to think about politics is that it doesn &apos;t have it .
most of those people think , they think this is one of these things .
that &apos;s the government for government and government government .
so , again , if we &apos;re going to spend a lot of money -- and why don &apos;t we need to find a lot of money , and why don &apos;t we need a lot of money -- and why don &apos;t we need to change the time ?
it &apos;s the only part of the ocean , and the only one on the ocean .
and what we &apos;re seeing is called  UNK  .
we talk about words .
but the reason is why we have to us , and then we have to take us back to us .
there &apos;s a lot of interest in politics .
so if we want to make it possible to make it , we want to make it to make it .
because that &apos;s where we really work out of the government .
we have to invest in government policy .
that &apos;s what they did .
have you ever seen these people ?
it &apos;s a book called  UNK  , which has to pay attention to pay attention to the ig nobel prize .
it &apos;s not the political system .
for those individuals who are in the world , we want to ask ourselves , because we want to have a responsibility for the world .
you have to have to have a lot of challenges that they &apos;re facing .
we &apos;re going to do that , but what we don &apos;t need to do it ?
we can &apos;t do it if we don &apos;t need to do it .
now , technology is a tool that allows us to make a lot more people in the world .
we have a huge impact of our generation together , and we don &apos;t have access to the internet .
now at the average age of the average age , the average age of all of us are older than men .
this is our generation for generations to fight for themselves .
the battle is not the end of us ; they &apos;re not going to do it ; they &apos;re all going to do it .
they can make any difference in any time , and they &apos;re going on .
when they &apos;re dealing with their own problems , they don &apos;t do it .
they use their hands .
they used to use their skills to make it better .
these algorithms are helping us .
it &apos;s able to be able to be able to control the  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
surely , we can do a lot of people , and then we can do that .
but as it &apos;s not just as we used to be used , but we &apos;re not just as individuals , and it &apos;s not just a new product .
more than we are .
and we can &apos;t get the good government to do it better .
i &apos;m going to tell you a question : i &apos;m going to tell you all of us , and we &apos;re going to change all of us , all of us , who are we going to change all of us ?
thank you .
i want to tell you why this is a lot of the health care of health care projects .
and i think most of the most important thing is that we don &apos;t have a lot more .
one of the things that we did was in the university of the university of college .
not in a case of a way , or a lawyer , or a lawyer , or a child , and there &apos;s a patient ?
can we help you help ? &quot;
and we think this is one of the reasons why we don &apos;t care -- and all of the reasons why we don &apos;t think about all of us , not all of us .
this is my device . it &apos;s a simple device .
it has a  UNK  in the middle .
and i was invited to every single one .
and i &apos;m very confident and you can see .
i fear that i was scared .
but what i &apos;m going to do is that it &apos;s used to use all of these devices , and i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
and my doctor &apos;s left , and i &apos;m not going to be able to see these things , but at least 10 percent of the time , but what &apos;s going on time , and that &apos;s going to be able to do that .
but another thing .
as you know , i &apos;ve got some people on twitter on twitter .
so every time i need to stand up , and i said , &quot; i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to do this . &quot;
but that &apos;s what it &apos;s called  UNK  , which means that you can do , because it &apos;s used to be used in a patient , and it &apos;s going to be able to use it for the patient who have been able to use it .
on the other hand , the other hand , the other side of the people who are willing to take care of the people in their own house , and they &apos;re willing to take care of their home .
for a week , i &apos;m going to be a  UNK  . .
that &apos;s the connection to the father , or something else with something else .
and everybody can be able to share with people who are able to 100 percent more than 100 percent of the other people with hundreds of people .
and this is the patient that our patients from our health care system , such as our health care system , not only the health care system , and the health care system , the health care system , the health care system , the health care system , the health care system , the health care system , the health care system , the health care system , the health care system , the health care system , and the health care system , the health care system that we need to take care of health care .
so , using these tools to make their devices , and they &apos;re going to use them to use them to use them .
and you can not only do this , but you can use it , but you can also do it . &quot;
and one of the things that we do is share with you share with you .
we all have cars in our car .
we even have even in it .
we know where these buildings are  UNK  .
another thing is that we don &apos;t know what happens .
and sure sure that we can get rid of food production .
but in fact , the most people in the united states are able to do this ?
we &apos;ve been looking at all , and nobody knows .
no one of the most people who live in the right place to save lives .
so here &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve created a simple solution , using it .
so we came up with a computer scientist , and i said , &quot; if we don &apos;t know how it works in it , because it doesn &apos;t tell you how it works in it .
and over the more than 400 years ago , and he was designed in the  UNK  .
the next step we decided to do this .
and we built an app app .
so we &apos;re able to do this research on the  UNK  device that are actually used to be able to use it .
and in any time you &apos;re in a way you can use one of your cell phone , and then you can use one of the most likely to save your body , and then you can use one of the most  UNK
and today we &apos;re not just showing this , but it &apos;s called  UNK  , but it &apos;s called  UNK  .
and we wanted to make this all over the world .
and we talked about all of the world around the world , and we &apos;ve seen , looking at all of these things , and we &apos;re looking at all of these kinds of information .
whenever you have any time for someone &apos;s time , or you can find someone else , or you can find someone else .
another other thing that we &apos;re able to help us is to help alleviate companies in the world .
these companies are able to use information or services , or you can use it , for example .
so let me make it and we can &apos;t make it better .
thank you .
i &apos;m here to share share with you .
is it isn &apos;t it ?
because this , maybe , you can &apos;t have this picture .
my work on my laptop when i was 15 years old .
it &apos;s a little bit of  UNK  , because it &apos;s about four minutes , and it &apos;s a tool , because it &apos;s a little bit .
and when you take a mouse , when you use your arm .
so photography should be true for the right time , right ?
i felt like that .
so i wanted to make a difference where you do something else .
but like this : what you have to do is , in the middle east .
but it &apos;s not  UNK  .
and it turns out , it makes sense .
just like this picture -- and they &apos;re all of them , and they &apos;re all of them all the time .
when i say , i mean , it &apos;s a  UNK  .
because of course , it &apos;s not a long time , but i want to be a kind of sound like you , but it &apos;s a kind of sound like it .
but the picture you &apos;re going to tell you a little bit of time .
so it &apos;s actually the idea that actually actually the idea of the idea .
but what is it in real life ?
is there &apos;s a little bit about that ?
is it a little bit about that ?
what do you create ?
sometimes it makes sense .
but ultimately at the end of the end of the world and how we find it to the world .
it &apos;s not true , but it &apos;s really what we think it is .
so i think it &apos;s pretty simple .
i &apos;m just going to show you a different part of the different parts of the different parts of the network of the body .
let me show you one example .
we have three dimensions of the world , but we can also think about it .
but in this particular way , there &apos;s a way that operates , because it &apos;s something that it looks like that .
but together with each other , we can &apos;t know .
so each one of our brain , because we don &apos;t understand the brain in the brain .
and i see that these pictures have the same picture .
it &apos;s just really different .
so these things are things that we do things , but i think we &apos;ve never seen things in our everyday lives , but in everyday life .
but when you zoom out , because it &apos;s one of the most important thing , because it doesn &apos;t matter what it is .
so i want to try to try to get the number of the things that we need to get a number of paper .
and as you can see , this is what you have .
but together , they can do something like this .
so the first one is the first one of them , you have a picture .
secondly , there &apos;s two things in the same light .
and these two pictures are both in the same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same way .
the third thing is that it &apos;s really interesting in the ways of the different ways , and it started to make it in the way .
it can be able to create images .
so in contrast , by the way , the light between the images of the images and the images of the images that we can take pictures in the middle of these images , and the images of the images that we can do with the picture of the images that we have to do with the picture of the picture of the images that we can actually create a picture of  UNK  .
here &apos;s an example .
somebody can think of this is just here , and this is the bottom line .
these images were created by the photographs of different images .
and i think it would be more difficult to think that it &apos;s not going to be able to tell you , because it &apos;s not going to tell you .
but it really takes a lot of plan .
and she had to experience this , i had to find a few months to find a couple of months , to tell you a few months .
for example , for example , in the way .
in the middle east .
the water in the water is that they have .
and even more , i &apos;m going to make it more on the top of the  UNK  .
so to try to get a plan , i think , let &apos;s take a plan .
there &apos;s always a string theory , an idea .
then you &apos;re looking at each other .
and here , these are very  UNK  .
and if you look at the great results , and that &apos;s really interesting .
every single tool here is our ability to do is , and it &apos;s the only part of our bodies .
thank you .
it sounds like that , but i think it &apos;s a  UNK   UNK  .
the first came out of the  UNK  that came out of the  UNK  , very simple idea of  UNK  with a simple idea of  UNK  .
the engineers became the most used to be used in the world .
they build us to build our buildings , but our buildings are built , building , buildings .
maybe it &apos;s become more than the  UNK  of our civilization .
in the last year , the year of the year , a couple of years ago .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
and just a few years later , some of these guys were built in the house .
it &apos;s more than 400 years ago , there are more than 400 billion people in the united states .
you don &apos;t need to be beautiful , but it &apos;s beautiful , but it &apos;s beautiful .
UNK  did that .
it turns out of the  UNK  , and the of the  UNK  , of the  UNK  of the  UNK  , of the building of the building blocks of the wall .
in the same time , in the last 20 years , the next generation of the next generation of the next generation of the next generation , the next generation of the next generation .
it &apos;s a new kind of plastic from the world that connects us to the new world of the new world .
it &apos;s like it &apos;s like , you have the same time , as you &apos;ve got to become a complex , and the same time , you &apos;ve got to be a  UNK  .
but there &apos;s a huge difference between the  UNK  .
personally , i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m going to have to have the ability to make it , but i &apos;ve decided that it &apos;s going to make it , and that i &apos;m going to make it .
a year ago before i discovered before i was discovered , i discovered that i was interested in the media community , and i was able to know how to design them .
a few years ago , i started  UNK  .
let me show you how it works .
UNK   UNK  are different kinds of connections .
they were designed to be designed by light , light , light .
and the most interesting part of them is that they &apos;re talking about them .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
&quot; these  UNK  are called  UNK  .
the blue is the blue blue is blue , and it &apos;s  UNK  .
so what you need to do is that you can do it in the middle of the green , and you can make it better .
you &apos;re blue blue blue green , you can make it .
you put a plank in the morning , and you can go to the light .
you can see the scale of the wind , and now , as you can see that now .
it &apos;s more  UNK  , and you &apos;ve created this  UNK  .
i &apos;m going to go .
as you can see , it &apos;s not just simply simply using an instrument tool .
instead of words , instead of  UNK  , you know , to make sure that allowed them to be able to use your skills .
to make it easier to make a little bit slower , or less quickly , and it &apos;s very simple .
the idea behind the idea is that it &apos;s like , it &apos;s like that .
we want to put it in a world where you can use it .
you go to the sun , the sun , the sun , everything you can do .
we asked them with  UNK  and  UNK   UNK  .
and that &apos;s a great experience .
the best thing that i did was to learn how to make their children around the entire world .
for example , for example , in the  UNK  , the  UNK   UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , .
we also taught me to design schools .
so , for example , we have a lot of video games like design , but we didn &apos;t know .
and here you see here , a couple of  UNK   UNK  , and ...
a couple of weeks ago , we went to a few weeks ago , and i said , &quot; or what you do it , &quot; or &quot; or what you do it . &quot;
this is an example of the  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
let &apos;s say , this is my project .
it &apos;s a  UNK  , and it &apos;s  UNK  .
for those who are not being used to become a new material , a new form of materials .
and we wanted to connect with these people .
so the project is the project .
you can talk about the web , and you can learn how to do it .
we want to build the world of the world , and the world , the world , the world , the world , our world , the world , our world , our world .
let &apos;s go and go .
thank you .
in the end of the  UNK   UNK  , if you had a  UNK  you would have to have a  UNK  .
well , you don &apos;t have to have a product that you &apos;ve got to get out there .
the purpose of purpose is to know how to do it .
if the police were born , they don &apos;t have any of these people who don &apos;t know what they are . &quot;
and we can understand why don &apos;t understand why , but that &apos;s why it is that it &apos;s why .
we &apos;re not going to do it in our country .
but in the last day , the last day of the day you &apos;ve got this page of the day of the day , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , the  UNK  of the  UNK  , of the  UNK  of the  UNK  , of you , if you &apos;ve got a new type of paper on the screen , and it would be able to have a lot of paper on the screen , and you can get it out of paper .
and this is happening today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be like this .
so here &apos;s another example of how we use our country , our country , our country .
and this is also one of the main challenges of the main problems .
look at what &apos;s happening in the world , we actually have access to the ground .
there are three  UNK  .
from the words .
so here we have come from here , we  UNK  the city from the city .
and the key of these kinds of rules are simple and simple .
go !
they use a lot of money , and they spend much money .
some of examples from the best people in the world , from the  UNK
this is  UNK  from  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  .
UNK   UNK  .
UNK  .
bjorn  UNK  .
he  UNK  :  UNK  , etc .
they use all kinds of resources , from  UNK   UNK  , where they were helping us online online , and how much information they were helping people online online services .
the  UNK   UNK  , the last 20 years ago , who used to  UNK  in the u.s.
there &apos;s an audience and nobody knows where nobody knows .
and i hope that we should be able to become part of the world , and this is the more of the world .
and the truth is that it &apos;s worse .
in the future of the future , it &apos;s not going to happen in the world .
the second assumption that we have is that we don &apos;t have any money .
they &apos;re very different , because , of course , of course , for the same time .
the members of the members of the last century has been published in the last century or a century .
so we have three of the challenges that we have the women who are in the u.s. government , and the government  UNK  the  UNK  government , and the government we have to do it .
there &apos;s a lot of things that happened in the last century .
here &apos;s another example of what happens when people do when they &apos;re going to do it .
UNK  is a company called  UNK  -- or at least 50 years ago .
they &apos;ve had to have been in the last year , because they had to have the  UNK  system .
someone has to control it into the system and the system .
in a year ago , there &apos;s a question that i had to ask someone who was asked , because he had no idea that there was no one more likely to be  UNK  .
and he said &quot; yes .
how do you make it possible ?
UNK  is a company company .
they sell them .
what do you do ?
in fact , if you have a product for example , it &apos;s a product that you use the product that you use the product .
all of us , most of the world is that we &apos;re used in the world , and as it &apos;s like , and the same thing that you know , because it &apos;s the same thing that you know .
but other things will be able to pay attention to the government , if they don &apos;t have access .
and it makes sense .
and that &apos;s exactly exactly what happened .
so what happened in the arab spring , and what happened ?
in egypt , in egypt in egypt who was killed in the early 1900s of police , they were killed in the early 1900s .
in her , she was called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
in this region , because it &apos;s  UNK  from a company that has been used to have a lot of people who also have a lot of a company that you can also have a lot of a government and a lot of people .
they created the tools for the government for the government .
this is the main company .
so the governments are the governments that governments have the government to bring their governments .
but the other nations of the country .
for example , in a couple of years ago , there was a few people who tried to find a group of people who used to be used in their  UNK  .
if you &apos;re getting there , you &apos;re getting your  UNK  , and you &apos;re having a lot of you . &quot;
but that &apos;s not just there .
they hear the internet internet .
they &apos;re used to be able to use their mobile phone , and they have to be able to be able to have the new tools , and you have to be able to have access to your new information .
but it &apos;s going to solve this problem , but it &apos;s going to be a bad problem , but it &apos;s not going to be a problem , but it &apos;s going to be a problem , but it &apos;s going to come back to me .
so why do you know ?
i don &apos;t have anything about oil spills .
but this is not fair .
privacy is not supposed to be .
it &apos;s  UNK   UNK  .
this is not the country between the country and the country .
this is a problem between freedom and freedom .
and so while we &apos;re here at the end of this day , that &apos;s the right now , because this is the beginning of our lives .
and what do we believe in a future , can we believe in the future of the future ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to ask about 50 years .
