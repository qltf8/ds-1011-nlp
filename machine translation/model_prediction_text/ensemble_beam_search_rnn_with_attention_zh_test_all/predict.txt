who &apos;s not ?
but the idea is going to have two problems .
don &apos;t talk .
so let &apos;s take a picture of what it looks like , and it &apos;s something that we don &apos;t even want to think about what we &apos;re doing in our daily lives .
i don &apos;t believe this .
but there &apos;s no one .
it &apos;s gone , and i didn &apos;t have to go out , and i &apos;d like to end up here .
the next step is to develop the apps .
i would say , &quot; i want to hear it . &quot;
but it turns out that we can ignore the death of the death penalty .
he said , &quot;  UNK  and everybody said he was very special . &quot;
i went out of the emergency room .
but what this means is , more importantly , more importantly , is a new generation of people who are trying to solve problems that are addressing the way to solve problems , rather than a  UNK  institution .
there are no stories about men ,  UNK  , angry ,  UNK  , just like two .
luckily , he didn &apos;t have died .
and i went to  UNK  , and i saw them , and they were  UNK  , they were as adults , as adults as adults .
today , i think that every single one of us is possible to be a victim of crime , even beyond the real world .
it &apos;s not in a very unscientific way -- she &apos;s coffee , or a coffee or a cup of coffee , the family , family .
and when i think about creating a society , it &apos;s not about saving lives for everyone on the planet ; it creates a life of life .
we teach our students in technology , and how we use these technologies to solve the challenges facing humanity .
what does this mean ?
now , all of us , or most of us , using the  UNK  or any of those who are in the state of affairs , such as they are , especially in iran , for example ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , to the  UNK  , to the  UNK  , to the their
the power is in the  UNK  , quiet voice , says , &quot; i &apos;m going to . &quot;
it &apos;s going to develop a software for a few years .
i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; okay , i &apos;m going . &quot;
it &apos;s a very important medical research .
we have online criminals .
so what happened ?
we did not know that .
we seem to be on this line , in the transition from the past .
in fact , these  UNK  are much more effective than i &apos;ve ever done .
let me give you a quick example .
now there &apos;s a few good news .
now , for the fact that we have given up our governments , and when we ask ourselves , we want to leave our children in our world .
and i &apos;m often amazed by the fact that i &apos;m going to explain what &apos;s going to happen next to me , and i think , since i &apos;ve been working with me , and i &apos;m going to talk about how i really think about it , i think , really , how i think , really
with a famous picture , what &apos;s called the name ?
and one day -- this is a real report -- and this information was thrown out : &quot; it &apos;s a  UNK  . &quot;
why are we going to use the  UNK  curve ?
most of our ideas are crazy , and a few of them are very smart , and we are .
the  UNK  lady was taken into a emergency hospital in toronto , and i was working as a  UNK  .
two years later , when i was in a town in a town in toronto , i went to a hospital in toronto , and i saw a man who was 25 years old .
and that was the first time that i realized that it was .
the united states is the only country in the world to be able to live in  UNK  countries .
and when i walked into a situation -- like , i don &apos;t know how to see me .
the next step , it &apos;s just as if it &apos;s just a few decades .
what i want you to see is not the details of it , but it &apos;s a form of form .
and this is a great example of government .
scott was the communication of people .
in order to win competition , this device is going to give you a diagnostic test for a group of researchers that have been tested .
it &apos;s both  UNK  and oxygen .
and i said , &quot; we want to challenge the challenges .
one of those nine people who have died of a death sentence is going to be  UNK  .
by brian , brian has a magic .
and in fact , this whole thing is very simple , and i put it on my data , and i &apos;m going to
they gave her blood pressure .
and they noticed that there was a lot of  UNK  in the city .
and then hundreds of people are starting to play this game .
but we &apos;re still doing it .
this is  UNK   UNK  .
in fact , if i was , or my colleague , i had a colleague in the hospital in the hospital , who believed me , and when i met him , i couldn &apos;t speak with him .
this is a typical example of government attacks against  UNK  .
two years later , i got a conclusion . the government , especially the local government , it was about it .
UNK   UNK  .
and i was in a small  UNK  in the  UNK  of the  UNK  in the  UNK  , and , , , i
let &apos;s think about energy .
today i want to talk to you today , not just  UNK  , which is the name of the product and the  UNK  .
and then she said , &quot; the second thing is , you have to say , &quot; you &apos;re going to say , &quot; you &apos;re going to go and you &apos;re going to go , even if you &apos;re going to go out . &quot;
i don &apos;t know how to use it .
we will not trust the government of the future , the government , the government , 50 years ?
and when i go to my grandmother , it &apos;s hard to get her to me , and it &apos;s time to me .
and this group of shared is shared and sharing it , and it &apos;s not going to talk about it .
but what &apos;s happening is that every individual has found , of course , the secret .
they &apos;re going to use a tool that uses a  UNK  tool that you can do with your computer , so that they &apos;re going to send them all of your communications , and you &apos;re talking about .
and he took a lot of his videos .
personally , i think i create a place where you find a place to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to engage with your ideas .
and as you can see , it &apos;s done with  UNK  and paper .
there &apos;s also a great inventors .
it &apos;s a game called  UNK  .
we developed a  UNK  app .
brian : there &apos;s a lot of opportunities .
but if you don &apos;t take it out , it can get it from you .
it won &apos;t be because of the big challenges that we face .
and i had a little company in which i was just trying to try to push us into the natural way of looking at nature .
that &apos;s how we can achieve .
you have to hear this audience , and this group wants to help you .
it has a program , a program and a program that &apos;s called &quot; citizen . &quot;
and it seems like it &apos;s waiting for the date , but it really is going to be able to get it into the  UNK  , it &apos;s going to be  UNK  , it &apos;s going to , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s ,
they had a  UNK  .
and because of the power of government , from the most fundamental source of our people , how we see it going to change it .
this is called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which is a kind of  UNK   UNK  .
maybe i have a reason for this .
and i think it &apos;s quite humbling , and we think it &apos;s the ultimate invention of evolution .
she had a  UNK  , and she had .
this graph shows up the trend .
we are poor .
through the glass , i saw her on the side .
it &apos;s probably one of the first one of the founders of the  UNK  program .
and i like this : &quot; the  UNK  . &quot;
i believe that every single person on this planet .
now , if i read these things , i don &apos;t know how they work .
and this is exactly the  UNK  movement in the united states .
last month , mit came up with a study that showed that in the united states of the united states , the cost of electricity in the united states , the cost of electricity , the cost of electricity in the united states , six to 10 cents per person on average , which is 15 cents .
so this fish is  UNK  .
the headquarters for the company is there .
and if you can get a nice picture of it , it &apos;s beautiful . it &apos;s pretty cool .
it &apos;s easy to fail .
and you can do that with this technology , you can do it in a way .
the video takes a time .
and in the same year , in new orleans , a new revolution is going to be launched , the next generation .
the citizens have a different way of dealing with this problem .
and so when you go out of the street , you see someone who is going to be someone who is your home or just a person , you can find it .
this is not our trouble .
they live in a world of information and communications , and this is what it can &apos;t predict .
we used to talk about this word .
and there , they create a good app for working with the city .
so let &apos;s take a light .
so , for example , maybe it &apos;s going to take a  UNK  or a  UNK  to look at the  UNK  .
i &apos;d like to say , &quot; okay , i &apos;ll be . &quot;
in this case , it &apos;s going to take two days to watch the web video in the video , only the unique and the video .
we have to participate in government .
we &apos;re going to keep the  UNK  .
and during that time , i added more and more knowledge .
and finally , i decided to do that , i had to do this .
this is a very small program .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do ? &quot;
what happened ?
another patient has severe depression .
at first , i thought we were playing games .
the  UNK  means that the horse is interrupted and swallowed by  UNK  , and it &apos;s not going to be thrown overboard , and it &apos;s not going to be
in this case , i said ,  UNK  , court and court .
and i hope that i can tell you that most of the worst mistake i &apos;ve ever made , and i started my career at the beginning of my career , like a lot of my colleagues .
and during that time , a  UNK   UNK  thought that was a  UNK  court .
and they gave her to her , and gave her some medication for her heart .
it was so busy , so i got a lot of it .
i &apos;d like to share with you a great example of dean kamen , and i want to share with you -- i &apos;ve got to share with you -- i &apos;m going to share with the technology that he called &quot;  UNK  , &quot; which some of you may have heard of it .
and three months after three months , we were in the  UNK  .
and then the  UNK  path .
until now , it &apos;s still a  UNK  computer .
i was brian  UNK  .
and she was wearing a hole in  UNK  , a pair of holes .
i think anyone can do this .
but if there &apos;s something like this .
this is an  UNK  , and i believe that it &apos;s going to make us not just for those things that are the ones that are good at the same time and the things that are the same .
we mean , this is a  UNK  of a  UNK  , and , , , three .
UNK  did it . when he noticed that the patient was a little  UNK  , it was a  UNK  .
and if you do that , you can name it , you name it .
UNK   UNK  : what does this mean ?
do you remember that in 1990 , the  UNK   UNK  on saturn , in the  UNK  of saturn , to the earth in orbit .
i put the weight out of  UNK  .
so let me start with this slide , and i &apos;m going to start with this slide .
and so , every time we have a lot of information , we collected a lot of information about our brains .
it shouldn &apos;t be here .
so rov is open-source .
how do i get it ? &quot;
but there &apos;s a major difference : there are only experts on the transistor .
thank you .
you have to realize that they need to be huge challenges .
and i mention this because i think it &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe we &apos;re all going to be  UNK  ?
nothing .
in 1972 , there were only people in prison .
and then i made a diagnosis , and i started to help her .
now , of course , random acts of random instructions that are not available , so they don &apos;t do it .
i said , &quot; repeat this process . &quot;
it &apos;s all about it .
UNK   UNK   UNK  , the great leaders of the  UNK  leaders .
in fact , there &apos;s a different way in which is that it enables them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to build , and more and more and more .
some people think that this is just one of the parts of the  UNK  .
we have a vision of technology and design that we have in technology and design creativity , and we have to engage with humanity .
these are all frequencies .
this is my  UNK  weight , which is a very simple thing .
when i was a young lawyer , i was privileged to meet the  UNK  .
well , the answer is , if i use a  UNK  curve , we say , this is a time , which is a time that i &apos;m going to try to draw a technology , which is kind of a ridiculous thing .
when i went to grad school , i was chosen to be as young as a young woman .
the nurse &apos;s  UNK  .
sometimes it &apos;s different from a different perspective .
like  UNK  , you can use it as a transistor , more complicated , more complicated circuit .
and it goes like this .
but what else can we do ?
and at the end of my job , i quit the hospital , and i went off to the parking lot of my car , and i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
we &apos;re going off .
so he did any good programmer , and he did a app .
but it &apos;s also a great example of a government for a government .
and in the west , we can &apos;t understand how people can do this , and it &apos;s going to
so ,  UNK  , and when these groups are very close to the fact that they come together , and they decided to put on a line of  UNK  to the  UNK  of the
he invited to dinner .
they &apos;re all designed for the light , light , or motors .
UNK  , like everybody .
this is the argument . it doesn &apos;t matter .
and my brother said , &quot; come on , we &apos;ve got a lot of it . we &apos;re a  UNK  .
but there &apos;s a code that i did , and what i did is i take this code , and we put it in a standard of letters , and then i put my card on top of it , and then i &apos;m going to add 10 to 10 times more .
and she said , &quot; no , no . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
and i &apos;d like to remind you that it &apos;s very challenging to a lot more than that .
we also know where the gas station .
in fact , in the community , there &apos;s a experts in the community and the structure of structure , and understanding the information .
she did come back .
this is a  UNK  .
go ahead . &quot;
and that &apos;s this , just like this .
we work in a situation where we &apos;re going to happen every single day in hospitals every day , and there will be a number of people who are going to give  UNK  the wrong , or the , and , , , and the , and the
that &apos;s what we have .
and the era of terrorism , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , in the end of the conflict and deepening of conflict .
and these are all sorts of problems together .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , the bacteria can actually activate the oxygen .
before the government , we had to deal with our responsibilities as citizens .
and in this period , there &apos;s a lot of cells in this period , and there &apos;s a lot of cell types of cells .
there &apos;s an interesting aspect of life in the life .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the technology and the design of our technology and our humanity , as long as we can be aware of the suffering from the poverty , the  UNK  and  UNK  .
it says , &quot; well , you have a million randomly chosen to sequence a sequence .
UNK  is the authority in the netherlands , or it used to be .
and when i asked her to go home after about an hour , she went on to the floor , and her family took her back to the emergency room , and she went to the emergency room .
and very quickly became the building blocks of the world .
the white line is the population .
but on the other hand is our self .
but it really requires a lot of planning .
and the next thing is a story about the women of the women .
so the nervous system is biological evolution , and it &apos;s evolved to accelerate the progress of evolution .
this is a  UNK  .
it will not say you &apos;re wrong , but you &apos;re bad guys .
now , if i &apos;m going to say , for example , another kind of technology , it &apos;s kind of like a  UNK  , a  UNK  on top of it , and it looks like a  UNK  line .
at the same time , 40 percent of the  UNK  .
why would i choose to medical medical ?
&quot; you never go . &quot;
the lego makes it possible .
every day worked hard .
and yet , i was interested in photography with photography , and i was 15 , and i was 15 years old .
it doesn &apos;t change the way .
and we put them each of them , including myself , and i got them , and then they asked them to perfect themselves .
and i thought this question .
we don &apos;t write the program .
a  UNK  app ,  UNK   UNK  .
and on the other side , another nurse , not to mention the woman who said that most of the doctors who were afraid to hear about three words .
her parents were real  UNK  .
it &apos;s going to pay attention .
this is al  UNK  .
and we got a report on this , and i said , &quot; i &apos;ve taken this place , and i found the  UNK  behind the house .
so this is the key thing , when patients are collecting data , they &apos;re not only able to control their own hands , but also to help us manage to deal with the challenges of health care , or health care .
and it &apos;s going to be  UNK  .
in rwanda , even after the genocide , people are still , but in the united states , we don &apos;t want to do it .
it doesn &apos;t seem to be  UNK  .
he kept talking about it .
last year , mr.  UNK   UNK  took this video that was taken from the  UNK  park .
i used to be bothered by these kids who were convicted of them .
and the night told us that he had to go to the  UNK  .
technology is speeding up faster and faster .
and the best thing is that they start to understand how they &apos;re in their daily lives .
if you look at the technology of the government , you know , it &apos;s not a common outcome .
and in this country , there are nearly four million deaths in the country that are killed in the united states .
and it &apos;s better , we spend billions of dollars -- the gps , gps and  UNK  and the medical technology -- and the medical technology -- and it &apos;s not going to put into your phone calls .
as a lot of people , i thought that government was just the election of the election .
so for example , in california , we &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars in the next five years .
a couple of months later had forgotten .
what do you hear when you hear about yourself once again ?
recession ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , egypt , syria .
every single time , it &apos;s not a chemical  UNK  .
i live in a parallel world .
but in 2011 , if you go from any big mac , you can buy a piece of paper clip , and you have a little piece of paper on the page , and there &apos;s a little yellow dot on the page on the page , and the page on the page is that you have a printer
so , for example , we used to make designers that have never been trained to play with legos .
and over the course of the next year , they came up with this .
he &apos;s walking around .
change is happening . we all know .
and these cells , again , again , starts to extract information .
i talked a lot of questions .
and she said , &quot; well , it will make you very tired , and it &apos;s  UNK  . &quot;
now i want to talk to you .
the death penalty in the u.s.
that &apos;s why the  UNK  top is  UNK  .
i even knew how to make a difference between a different  UNK  .
and then i was doing something like this , because when they put her in a situation , she would send her back to the ward , and i wanted her to wake up .
when i got my brother , my brother took me back to the beer -- i didn &apos;t know what he was going to -- he took me and my sister and went to the forest .
that &apos;s what happened to yesterday .
and many people forget that .
thirty billion people are not aware of new users .
and i took this year , and i &apos;m going to give you that i never had a drink .
it allows us to produce more complex things than we can produce .
we &apos;re going to make a conflict .
but what does it look like ?
start with a  UNK  doctor .
and the film is going to go to the movies , which is completely about statistics , and how to build a great  UNK  .
now , i &apos;m not saying that these problems don &apos;t exist -- the climate crisis , it &apos;s going to happen .
and the state of this country is going to be bad for you , if you &apos;re a poor person , rather than the poor person .
and we learned from the fact that the problem is that people are responsible for their crimes .
go back home ?
a couple of years ago , i started a little bit about the incredible technology and the , and the and the the the , the the the the the
well , it &apos;s good . i gave myself a  UNK  . you can see it .
oh my gosh !
there was no support of the husband , with her husband to go to the court , and she  UNK  .
you can go to the website , download all of the files , to make it .
unlike the other  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , i forget my existence .
a few years ago i started developing a few years ago .
the underwater part is a  UNK  .
but these aren &apos;t really alive , and now we &apos;re looking at it , because each of them is a random jumble of chemicals .
and when she died in 600 miles away , i was in the hotel room in sydney .
and she sent me to the side and said , &quot; i want to talk to you , you don &apos;t have to say anything . &quot;
UNK  .
so these groups are starting to evolved to evolve so much more than just a single cell .
UNK   UNK  : oh my god , oh my god . oh my god .
he &apos;s silence .
scott  UNK  this .
i assembled a group that can &apos;t be done , and the only thing we can do .
we &apos;re like the amoeba . it &apos;s what we &apos;re creating .
these pictures need to be able to figure out how to do it .
a third of the black men in the middle ages is not in prison , it &apos;s in  UNK  or  UNK  .
because ultimately , what we &apos;re going to talk about is that there is more hope for more and more and more and more of the challenges in this complex society .
my mother was always  UNK  .
other doctors are afraid to be heard about three words , but because of the doctors who are looking at these patients , they have a special meaning to us .
it &apos;s just that simple .
there are only two types of people in the system -- it &apos;s wrong about the wrong thing , that can be  UNK  and  UNK  and the results .
but it &apos;s unexpected .
but in the middle , there &apos;s a good luck , it &apos;s going to take two of them .
so every morning i went out of every day , and i was able to talk to myself , and people started to talk to me and said , &quot; i want you to lunch today . &quot;
but i still kept asking myself .
we call them the center of the animal , a lot of money .
but when we take a picture , it &apos;s worth recalling that we &apos;re thinking about it , and it &apos;s going to be
but wait , wait , you know what ?
i call it a billion people .
so anyone can tell you how it works .
so , i gave him a prescription for him , and he gave him away .
i &apos;ll never go .
now what i want to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they &apos;re not going to be forever .
it &apos;s  UNK   UNK  , and there &apos;s a lot of tribes .
so if someone needs a lot of my business cards , i have enough to give everyone in this room , and even everyone around the world .
and i didn &apos;t do anything wrong for a while , until i met a woman .
i have a hundred  UNK   UNK  , and i tried to try to get out of the airport .
light , sound , solar panels ,  UNK  -- everything should be  UNK  .
and if we have a family , it has to come to women .
there are billions of  UNK  .
and the most important thing is that every single person who is  UNK  , i just want to talk to you and look at it , it &apos;s going to look at it .
but we also know that it doesn &apos;t exist .
and i think that this picture makes sense , if you go from a thousand years ago .
here &apos;s another example .
and what &apos;s amazing about this is that this kind of way to look at it , because it &apos;s evolved to 25 million years ago .
i went back to work .
next step , the nervous system and the brain .
we wanted to help people who were  UNK  .
so how does that happen ?
and that &apos;s what i felt like .
so please join us in a project to help us not only be healthy , and we can make it .
so we started to rely on computers to do with a different process .
and when we say a  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
and so i got a new set of prototypes that made a lot of  UNK  .
and that &apos;s what i was getting in medical school .
and the heart of this heart is the core of my belief that we have to participate in .
these are the questions that we &apos;re going to for 50 years .
they earn a lot of money , and a lot of money .
but many of them are  UNK  .
and that &apos;s what it looks like .
the first one is made out of a very simple idea , which is a very simple idea : to put it into a piece of wood .
the way to fold the structure of the structure of the amino acids .
and she &apos;s got the ability to make eye contact with her .
well , the good news is that technology is going to be defined as a function of governance , and it allows us to strengthen our civil society .
here &apos;s another  UNK  from  UNK   UNK  .
now , at the age of the time , i said , &quot; mr.  UNK  , you &apos;ve got to tell you what you &apos;re going to tell you about 9 / 11 years ago . &quot;
so we have a problem with this ...
we have three main groups .
i learned a very simple principle .
it &apos;s not a privacy issue .
and she asked her , &quot; why would the grandmother &apos;s  UNK  , the rest of it ? &quot;
he said , &quot; i &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
and we &apos;re going to do this project around the world .
i know she &apos;s a goodbye .
that &apos;s why , for example ,  UNK   UNK  .
so i want to talk about it .
and the  UNK  came up , and this is  UNK  .
even when i finished my career , i realized that i couldn &apos;t be a law .
and two of these two  UNK  exchange for them to make their kids , they have these two  UNK  traits .
because ultimately , our whole humanity depends on our humanity .
we all love baseball , isn &apos;t it ?
yes ,  UNK  percent is the only two percent of the iceberg , and we &apos;ve got the water on the planet , but we still hope .
and these parties are very inspiring and inspiring .
we &apos;re going through the same process of cells that we &apos;ve ever experienced -- we &apos;re recording , we &apos;re going to ,
and what i &apos;m going to look at is the timeline of life on earth .
and i want to talk to you about a couple of reasons for the health care system .
when i was on the road , there was a black black guy , the  UNK  of the court .
and they came back to death .
even though these two cases , i didn &apos;t let them go home , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s any kind of  UNK  and  UNK  .
the problem is not energy , it &apos;s not .
some people say that partly because it &apos;s associated with  UNK  percent .
of course , the brain is very important .
so it &apos;s  UNK  .
we actually have a couple of cases where they are online ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
and i love my mother , and i said , &quot; okay , i &apos;ll be . &quot;
and the sound does .
and i talk about what you &apos;re going to do . &quot;
UNK   UNK  .
for example , in germany , it was discovered a couple of weeks ago , a group called  UNK  , which was called  UNK   UNK  , which was called  UNK  .
i &apos;m a student of  UNK  .
you &apos;re a guy who &apos;s  UNK  .
i &apos;m going to take the  UNK  , because i &apos;m going
some people made a  UNK  .
what do you do ?
california is a  UNK  for a billion dollars a year for a billion dollars a year , and it doesn &apos;t work .
&quot; remember that ? &quot;
but there are more than 48 hours on youtube .
and so , this is actually one of my favorite projects .
and then , in the end of the  UNK  , the , is to
what &apos;s going on with the arab spring ?
after a trip .
in 2010 , this video was taken by three million .
al  UNK  is a fire hydrant .
and it was necessary for me .
but that &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s based on drugs .
because i don &apos;t sleep too late . i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do .
aluminum used to be the most metal metal in the world , and it &apos;s expensive .
how do you know about the baseball  UNK  , how do you know about the  UNK  players ?
you can put it in a middle , and you make a little  UNK  .
and they said , &quot; we grew up in the  UNK  . &quot;
i &apos;m interested in this .
today america is the highest state in the world .
a series of things that we never had before .
it &apos;s essentially the  UNK  of our era .
i &apos;m not just one person who is dying and a lot of disease .
because the only way i decided to understand this is the way to look at it .
people around the world are doing things that they love .
my grandfather was  UNK  because i was in prison .
and this is a good information , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at the digital world .
today i &apos;m going to show you a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m going to stand here in the comfort zone , and the world is going to start off , not the way you &apos;re worried about it .
in the netherlands has already been  UNK  .
i had a dinner with  UNK   UNK  , and he pulled out a card and he said , &quot; look , look at this .
it &apos;s a statistic .
so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we are , we &apos;re going to start off .
they will monitor your internet .
okay .
and each of these images are  UNK  .
it &apos;s seen that governments can become more efficient , but it &apos;s not more like a private company , like a lot of people .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here .
the cost of solar power has halved .
and it turned out to the x-rays , but the results were normal , and my colleagues at the time i was doing a diagnosis of the patient &apos;s patients .
there &apos;s a technology in preparation for the next 10 years , not in the next 10 years .
so for example , if you &apos;re in california , this is a meeting that &apos;s going to be a big one , and it &apos;s going to be about , and we
and at the same time , my doctor can also get e-mail , and then he can look at what i &apos;m going to see if i don &apos;t look at what &apos;s going to happen when it comes to a heart attack , and when you look at the heart attack , it &apos;s going to look at
solar technology ...
this is the video game .
one of the things that we need to think about is that the government is not about politics .
so if you take technology trends , it &apos;s going faster , and then i &apos;m going to take a taxi and then in the 30 seconds .
i represent the kids .
so i went to court .
that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to say .
UNK  8 : the tsunami :  UNK  .
green is the output , the blue is , and the color is the input , the orange .
i did a lot of fun things .
and when i woke up in the morning , i woke up , and i did this dream , or did i write this proposal ?
no one knows that it &apos;s going to be able to be able to
i was so successful .
it &apos;s kind of  UNK  , organic , natural .
the point is .
fifty percent of them are  UNK  .
and it &apos;s a little bit different .
all i have to ask , i &apos;ve been asking myself , what is the future of the world ?
so i &apos;m going to take the data , and this is an example of how i &apos;ve experimented with it .
but it can &apos;t be accepted .
unlike the  UNK  of the 20th century media , it &apos;s a collective engagement that allows us to become part of the phenomenon -- to spread , or through innovation .
for example , the most famous version of what we know is the human language .
it &apos;s sort of a jigsaw puzzle .
and then at the end of it , i was going to put in my hands .
this old black man stood up and look at this  UNK  , look at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell this young man , and it &apos;s going to look at it . &quot;
so the neurons are the information processing of these cells .
it &apos;s not a difficult diagnosis .
this is a thousand times a year .
they &apos;re a group of citizen citizens , and they wrote a very detailed ,  UNK  report report to the united states .
number three :  UNK   UNK  and community .
eight years ago , when i was in the media lab , i started thinking about how to create the power of the engineers and the designers .
although it &apos;s very little , but there &apos;s a lot of  UNK   UNK  , and  UNK  , say , &quot;  UNK  , &quot; go , &quot;
and that &apos;s what happens when you get a  UNK  player ?
it &apos;s going to end by the end of the game , and the world &apos;s
so , how do you get to death ?
there &apos;s even more  UNK  .
on the one hand , i &apos;m a typical asian student , and it &apos;s particularly  UNK  .
it &apos;s a  UNK  false error .
and for the only purpose of life , the only purpose is to get home to australia .
and then you agree that it would be  UNK  .
she grew up in the age of  UNK  , local  UNK  .
but if you put these objects together in a way , you can create a visual object , and it &apos;s kind of like a three-dimensional object , as if it &apos;s going to be there .
the death penalty .
and i think there &apos;s a theory of understanding how life evolved from the  UNK  , but i &apos;d like to tell you about a simple story , which is , at that time , there &apos;s a  UNK  in the  UNK  , and .
we have a couple of people every year , and let them work for government .
ten minutes later , the judge was going to rest .
it &apos;s the last fall in the last year because they were attacked .
here &apos;s another version of the puzzle .
some of you may know that i have  UNK  fans .
but they can do it .
in the united states , two months ago , two months ago ,  UNK   UNK  , at the  UNK  bank accounts in the  UNK  bank accounts .
we see it on the mobile phone .
i think this opportunity to help us .
now i &apos;m working on solar energy .
but there are all sorts of citizens in the citizens , so everybody can see it .
and that is , when you look at the  UNK  of our anger , such as the way we think of politics , our government  UNK  , our government , in the center of the  UNK  , the  UNK  , , , , , , , , to , &quot; we can
in fact , there &apos;s no one in a medical surgeon who knows a good surgeon , a doctor or a  UNK  .
and our policing system is not just changing the change , but it &apos;s also  UNK  around the world .
so it &apos;s got a little bit of entertainment .
and i &apos;m sitting here , basically ,  UNK  , and i want you to build a similar kind of mess that you have in the brain , and it &apos;s kind of like something like this .
because this is obviously a picture , but you &apos;re not using cameras .
and i didn &apos;t go back to the whole court , and the whole court was upset , because we were talking about the fact that we were talking about poverty .
and there are people who are  UNK  , or other people who are willing to pay attention .
and i began to wonder , what &apos;s going on ?
we can make the world doing things that they don &apos;t think .
when i was a kid , i grew up in the future , like in 2000 , people were going to talk about 2000 .
so there was a couple of days to program , and it was a  UNK  program , and it was a
and when you take a camera picture , you get the end of the walk .
UNK  in the &apos; 40s , her parents were  UNK  .
because there &apos;s a kind of thing that jimmy  UNK   UNK  that we &apos;re going to talk about , and that &apos;s interesting to the
but the bear doesn &apos;t have to do it with video .
hello . i &apos;m kevin kelly , and i &apos;m youtube , and i &apos;m youtube .
i picked up the  UNK   UNK  of the muscle and the  UNK  , the , of , , of , of , of , of , of , of , of , of , of ,
last year we have the code in the united states .
and that &apos;s because the government is like a giant ocean , and politics is just the top of the top .
we love it .
you all have the capacity to be the technology .
it can happen in the context of learning .
on the law of moore &apos;s law , it &apos;s a series of technology for all of us .
because now we &apos;re not just doing it , we &apos;re involved in it .
in many communities , people are afraid to be  UNK  .
this generation has been used to be used to  UNK  themselves .
and they talk about the fact that terrorism is going to be the end of the
how many of you see here in the audience , who is ibm  UNK  ?
you know , ultimately , we have to believe that those things don &apos;t have .
when she was born , the father died .
so they &apos;re longer longer , more .
this is one of the biggest problems of today .
these people represent a billion billion dollars a billion dollars in the global economy .
and it says , &quot; well , there &apos;s a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of work , and you &apos;re going to make it safe . &quot;
and one of the things that i learned in the  UNK  , is the , the , the , , , , , , , , , , , , the the and the
it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , when we &apos;re in .
i believe it means that we have a crisis .
they were at the beginning of february , and last year , it was a lot .
the most primitive ones are formed in the form of these cells .
and i remember , when i was in my morning , i wake up in the morning and i went to the living room .
and she said , &quot; your mother is my mother-in-law , you have to give me to you . &quot;
there is the power of the creation of creation .
and the idea was hiding in the  UNK  , which is a  UNK  .
they can do anything in any time in any time .
and the more i said , the more people invited me to speak .
the point is that the media tend to  UNK  information about our information , because our brains are very aware of this .
the phone , the computer , the computer , the , , , , , , , , , our , , we ,
we have the input from the government system .
and that used to say about the headline : &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you this ted talk that i &apos;ve heard about this .
i mean , this is a picture of a picture .
sometimes , when things are going on in the ted stage , there &apos;s a lot more impact on the stage .
in a sense , the computer is better than us .
it &apos;s always going to be a kind of idea of ideas and ideas .
now , there are four people who have lost 30 percent of the black men in the  UNK  .
now , if you live in a remote part of a remote area , and the two of the people that you love love is  UNK  . you &apos;re going to send her to the  UNK  of the  UNK  .
and i &apos;m thinking , this will be a  UNK  . it &apos;s painful .
this is actually going to be hundreds of millions of years .
and if i &apos;m going to come to a room with my colleagues in my colleagues , they &apos;re helping to help and talk to them and talk to them , and i &apos;ll tell you about two more than two stories before , and they &apos;ll start to tell you a story .
who &apos;s going to be able to say rainbow &quot; or &quot;  UNK  &quot; or &quot;  UNK   UNK  ? &quot;
and i think the most important point is that we don &apos;t listen to patients .
we have a lot of cells , and they don &apos;t have to survive .
again , the language , etc .
it &apos;s two  UNK  .
now generation generation is growing up , and they know that the same thing is going to do , and it &apos;s just going to require the system .
if you think about it today , most of the people living in the united states are still going to have electricity , drinking water , toilets , toilet , etc .
i &apos;m afraid .
and i was also talking about the death penalty in germany .
and if they find a piece of paper on the wrong , they &apos;ll be able to track them .
in fact , we know that the engineering process is not really good at work .
in 1947 , in 1947 , for example , the lego brought this .
and what &apos;s interesting is that the slide is just a lot of the slide that we &apos;re familiar with , is a straight line .
and what we &apos;ve learned is that as a teacher , you have a influence , and if you &apos;re a very good teacher , it &apos;s a
we want to fight against prejudice and discrimination .
your ideas don &apos;t need people .
in addition to simplicity , it &apos;s actually  UNK  .
in the most  UNK  , the  UNK  of the on , on the planet , never .
and what i &apos;d like to talk to you about is the  UNK  system .
&quot; do you remember ? &quot;
we know that it &apos;s going to think about three or three years , and it &apos;s not going to happen because it &apos;s going to be so that it &apos;s going to
today i want to share with you a picture of my photography .
they &apos;re using their hands with their hands to make their programs better .
people seem to think that politics is sexy .
now , we &apos;re going to see that in the next generation we have , our government will never lose .
so now there &apos;s a  UNK  version of &quot;  UNK  &quot; on youtube .
and i began to understand that , and i believe that every single one of us would not be defined by the worst side of our worst .
we have a kind of idea : when we &apos;re all going to get rid of all of us , we &apos;ve got to get a safe system .
in other words , they came up , and in this way , in this way , in this case , you can write down the genetic information that allows them to replicate .
UNK   UNK  : the war on drugs
i never never knew his real life .
i don &apos;t know how to connect the machine .
but on the other hand , it can also bring people together into some kind of activity in the game .
that &apos;s all possible .
when i was a young boy , i saw her .
my family was a traditional black black family , only one of my grandmother .
ask , &quot; what do you have ? &quot;
and i started  UNK  .
we &apos;re actually helping these people .
it &apos;s estimated that the production of these  UNK  are over four billion dollars -- or 75 billion dollars .
but these programs are like  UNK  , and you can remind us that we &apos;re not just as consumers . we &apos;re not just a government , but we &apos;re not just providing our government to pay taxes .
it &apos;s like a virus .
for a year , we had no one .
so imagine that this device applied to lack of medicine , 25 percent of the disease burden in the developing world .
this is not ...
do you want to hear us ? &quot;
i sometimes work too much .
this kind of  UNK  -- one of the people who were completely innocent .
i drink a little bit , and my sister got a little bit , and you . &quot;
&quot;  UNK  . &quot;
it can help people in the government services to help people , but a neighbor has a lot better than the government .
so it &apos;s going to be different .
something happened to me .
it &apos;s not for me to have a moral imperative to make sense of how to make sense .
so i &apos;m going to leave you with a question : when we &apos;re dealing with a lot of important things , and we need to do something together , and we &apos;re just going to have a bunch of people , and we &apos;re going to have a group of people who are going to be  UNK  ?
a lot of people understand that , but they still believe that politics is the government of the government .
and so we were able to have our brains because the brain is that it &apos;s not the fact that this object is not true .
it &apos;s never going to eat .
now , the court doesn &apos;t have the  UNK   UNK  , which is  UNK  .
but it was really that , because that &apos;s what it &apos;s about stress , and the stress of stress is able to help the patient -- it can help revolutionize medicine .
and the team around the world is going to be able to bring these technologies into mobile devices , and you can talk to it , because it has an ai for it , or it &apos;s  UNK  .
so all of the tools that all of our tools are going to be our our imagination .
i was asked when i was asked to talk to conferences , and i asked a leader , who was a leader who would find someone who might find someone who was probably going to die .
maybe it &apos;s because i &apos;ve been  UNK  for many years , and i &apos;ve got to give up a little bit of a
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to build beautiful , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
now , if you &apos;re looking at this , you can see someone in your car , you can buy a mobile phone in your iphone , and you can actually save lives .
you don &apos;t even tell you that you &apos;re a  UNK  killer .
UNK  : in the bin laden in the bin laden is  UNK  .
this guy came to me with a hug .
i was crying by  UNK  , and calls me up and said , &quot; my wife &apos;s coming back , we &apos;re going to  UNK  .
and my responsibility is to keep his experience , and it &apos;s not my responsibility to learn from that point in history , and it &apos;s been  UNK  for us .
this project is called the united states code , and it &apos;s kind of like  UNK  .
the  UNK  era changed their lives .
i actually learned from my grandmother .
in many cases , there are only three percent of the population and a half million people , and it &apos;s become a  UNK  culture .
so it &apos;s very easy to do with online criminals .
speaking of the same english language , people are interacting with each other , and one of them is the same .
and then it &apos;s a different picture .
so , for example , take a look at this  UNK  , or a little bit , and you just need to turn it down , and it &apos;s going to make it a little bit faster .
but the problem is that if i can &apos;t talk to talk about what i &apos;m going to talk about , if i can &apos;t figure out what i can &apos;t tell you that i can &apos;t tell you that i can &apos;t tell you that i can &apos;t tell you that i can &apos;t tell you that i
it &apos;s impossible .
now , if you think this is an amazing thing , and it &apos;s more difficult to imagine this video , and it &apos;s about three hours of  UNK  .
and in the short time , i noticed that there &apos;s ted .
oh , my god !
so what we did was we put in a machine in the machine process , and it &apos;s going to happen .
i signed up in the hospital , and the ambulance came out of a hospital , and she sent her home .
peter diamandis : this is a video that i &apos;ve collected in the last six months , and if it &apos;s six days or six days , it can be used in the last six days .
the coast was taken on another site .
so this is just one of the random things that i took from my documents .
in order to do this , i think the most important thing is planning .
we &apos;re on the tipping point .
well , thank you very much .
people know the danger .
the point is that there is a or a group of people who are watching youtube videos , and they share their views on the planet .
my brother is me .
and in the last winter last year , i knew that i had a few months of planning to planning this , which was basically going to be different .
we &apos;ve heard a few words .
and i would say , &quot; of course , ma &apos;am . &quot;
i think it should change .
another way of thinking about it is not that people are  UNK  for crimes , but we don &apos;t kill them .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet on the planet , which is about energy consumption per year .
like all adults , my mother took a little bottle .
it &apos;s a gateway that allows people to make a amino acids , and analyze how the protein is folded .
you don &apos;t need programming ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , and you can do it .
i had to do it .
and if you &apos;re wondering about the peak , you &apos;re on friday .
so this is the brain and the nervous system .
and we can &apos;t get rid of it .
so if you &apos;ve got to  UNK  , and then you &apos;ve got to give it to a surgeon in the  UNK  surgery .
why do i worry ?
a couple of weeks ago , we took a  UNK  to the rhode island school , and we gave it to a bunch of things that didn &apos;t have been done with a piece of  UNK  , paper , paper -- paper and paper -- and they said , &quot; do something . &quot;
it &apos;s not allowed to be  UNK  or  UNK  .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re in your pocket in your pocket , it &apos;s cheaper to be 100 times cheaper , and it will be 1,000 times more .
they can also , if they attacked a foreign authority .
because of all of these technologies .
it &apos;s really exciting . when i teach the history of history , i &apos;m talking about it .
the world is a world .
but the western government also did the same .
it &apos;s a bit odd .
after two days later , i went to the emergency room , and i was asked to talk to her in the office .
this is  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  , etc .
these are two pictures , and they &apos;re the same as the same as the same .
so he asked the citizens to see them .
and i walked into the judge , and i said , i said .
and there &apos;s no information .
we used to  UNK  the kids and watch them .
it made a  UNK  .
and i think it &apos;s not a  UNK  philosophy of who &apos;s not .
we now know that nine cities are going to use it .
the cat is watching watching the cat .
my mother ,  UNK   UNK  , 18 years old , and a series of marriage .
these guys are making money .
i work in my work .
and this is true for all of us .
before we go to the subject , let &apos;s talk about baseball .
i &apos;m sure that the society needs to be a bit more .
think about our own lives and our lives , we can now be able to see that a man must be able to keep us . we have to be .
now , this is not the old medium of media , but it &apos;s not all the media , but it &apos;s going to be going to be the
my job is , when it comes to a group of people in the heart of a heart attack , at the end of the patient .
my good friend steve  UNK  shows the tools of technology that technology has ever been able to do this curve , and moore &apos;s law .
so i wanted to do something special about this , and when you get to the bottom , the whole process is just beginning .
and i said , &quot; computer , please give you 10 percent in the sequence .
it &apos;s almost like the  UNK  of the immune system , like the antibodies .
and if we want the department to do it for us , we have to make it sexy .
kevin : in a humorous way , funny  UNK  , who &apos;s really interesting to think about it .
even in the cell phones .
and find the best  UNK  .
in other words , in the future of my life , it &apos;s going to be .
and i looked at it , and he had some  UNK  .
so , these interactions are forming , and in a sense , in a sense , they &apos;re on the same boat ; they &apos;re collaborative .
have you seen these people ?
i &apos;m sad .
thank you .
they just need a  UNK  .
or , is it a picture of photography ?
so it &apos;s not possible .
i also believe that in many parts of the country , of course , of course , of course , of course , a lot of poor places in the world , not rich .
at the time , i went to  UNK  , and i was  UNK  .
what do we need help ? &quot;
as i grew up in the south , i had a brother , and i was a little boy , and i had my sister .
they don &apos;t have to go through the generation of our generation , who will have access to freedom , and they have the freedom of freedom .
and i &apos;m not talking about the definition of the platform .
we have seven million people in  UNK  and  UNK  .
and before we begin to care about human rights and dignity , we can &apos;t really do it .
you know , they know how they call a  UNK  rate .
so , for example , language is a small step in this direction .
you know ,  UNK  , you know , if there &apos;s a crash in the airplane , we &apos;re not going to be able to
they don &apos;t give up government .
there are hundreds of thousands of  UNK  in the world .
but the most important thing is that inspired by technology , the  UNK  culture .
i didn &apos;t do what i was supposed to do , and i picked up the phone call , and i asked him to look at this case , give him a chance to a patient .
in fact , he didn &apos;t have a  UNK  .
and when we look at these things , people respond to it , and it &apos;s obvious to say , &quot; it sounds terrible , but because i &apos;m a legal citizen , and i don &apos;t really know .
we work on a daily basis .
you can put it on google , but it &apos;s not the throat , but it &apos;s a  UNK  infection .
thank you very much for ted . thank you .
i mean , this is a real problem .
what are you going to write about writing ?
so today we &apos;re going to talk about why some videos are going to be important .
in fact , any organism is completely identical with the same letters .
now , if i was told by the way that i was taught , i had all of these things that had been done wrong , and it &apos;s not going to
this time , a neighbor sees .
but now the web video allows it to allow us to do what we want to do , and then it &apos;s part of the world &apos;s part of the world .
i was sitting on the other side of my room and looked at me .
and let me end up with my three words : &quot; i remember it .
my grandmother was born in the early &apos; 80s , and my parents had been influenced by looking at the world .
so this is  UNK  , and the government can track the text .
and it &apos;s obviously getting worse .
and she &apos;s connected to the  UNK  .
it &apos;s not going to put them in the third world , but they &apos;re going to
we &apos;re going to send the whole world to the
and of course .
now , at this conference , you &apos;re talking about the future , and you can see that the future is in 2000 .
but i think there must be something to us .
i wake up .
and you can imagine that artificial intelligence like this artificial intelligence , all of the people who have access to the phone .
and then in a few years , the lego of each family had a family .
and the first one is that a man is working with a man .
i think i moved to the united states .
these people know something that we &apos;ve lost .
it can happen in a lifetime of a living organism , and then in this particular form of structure , it &apos;s evolved to learn how to learn how to do it .
and i think we &apos;d like to think that this is one of the main causes of all the health care system , and one of the main reasons is that we don &apos;t listen .
some people shredded it completely destroyed .
now , what i &apos;m doing is design is not designed to design objects .
they &apos;re abstract , strange .
but then there &apos;s a  UNK  technology that makes it  UNK  , so that we &apos;re putting it in a very short amount of time .
&quot; she goes back . &quot; she did this .
we &apos;ve got a little bit too far away .
and i started to add a little bit .
and if you &apos;re one of them , i want you to think about it , because a lot of things are changing .
once again .
put it in the fire , go home .
now , it &apos;s also true that it &apos;s too much better than the fact that we don &apos;t have to think about it , because we don &apos;t have to think about it .
two things happen .
and of course , a lot of people started to fire a fire hydrant .
it &apos;s very common .
thank you .
in these documents , there was a  UNK  named  UNK  .
and i want to ask you a question .
and i &apos;m here today because i believe that there are lots of people who understand that the moral world of this world , even though there is a long time , but it &apos;s going to be the end of the
in fact , our genes are exactly the same code , the same way .
it &apos;s more than 70 billion people on earth .
and i went back to work in the clinic .
the second thing is , of course , is the same light .
i told my mother , i couldn &apos;t do it .
i still feel lonely , guilty .
we don &apos;t have a government , and we need to make it more efficient .
it &apos;s not really about what it is , but we think it &apos;s really true .
and then i did a  UNK  : if i did the perfect thing , i wouldn &apos;t get it wrong .
we want to reduce the population .
who knows that ?
so the wrong thing is .
brian : it &apos;s almost nothing to do .
these are the neural structure .
30 years ago , it sounds ridiculous .
even when he came out of the door , he seemed to look at his throat .
and there are some chemicals that are in the form of chemicals , and it causes them to grow from the outside .
what you need to do is you have a  UNK  site , you have a  UNK  website , a service service .
and then finally , he said , &quot; well , you can open your door and open up the door , and then it &apos;s going to get out loud , and see if it &apos;s going to go away ? &quot;
and the kind of thing that i &apos;m talking about is that it &apos;s going to happen to you .
but think of them in a sense , in a sense , they put them into our lives .
in the next day , the afternoon , my gut had a feeling of a kind of  UNK  .
we really live in a great age .
we &apos;re now using these things that are going to be able to grow faster and faster .
rng : today , friday , friday . i &apos;m going to spend a weekend on the friday nights , and on sundays , you know , it &apos;s a friday . i don &apos;t think about it .
and i think , in a lot of places , poverty , is the justice .
when a neighbor comes to another , we have a social connection .
you know , for the sake of children , it &apos;s not  UNK  .
there &apos;s a particularly interesting thing that i &apos;ve been using , which is the evolution itself .
these three words : remember that ?
it comes from seattle .
i said , &quot; good . &quot;
or there &apos;s a picture like this , but there &apos;s a color of it , but it &apos;s for the purpose of it .
in the poor communities , in the community communities , in desperation , of desperation , that desperation has been transformed by these changes .
in my medical school , journalism , journalism , in my inbox , i wrote a book in  UNK  , called &quot;  UNK   UNK  , &quot; which i &apos;ve been able to study with my medical health and medical errors .
we used to bring to the design school .
so for four years of  UNK  , the story of the story of the  UNK  of the and the
let me give you an example .
and they &apos;ll be able to use mobile phones , and they &apos;re more healthy , because they &apos;re going to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of the
she &apos;s  UNK  . it &apos;s very strong .
we tell stories stories , and she promised us to keep her .
maybe it could be  UNK  , and i can &apos;t take care of my patient , to take care of his patients .
and they &apos;re going to zoom in , they &apos;re going to they , and they they look at them on the ground , and they start to tell me their stories .
it can take any water from any water -- water , water pollution , water pollution ,  UNK  water ,  UNK  water .
this is the main reason why we are in prison .
politics is not changing , but the government is changing .
on the other hand , i &apos;m in danger of reality , violence against violence and  UNK  .
and when i think about my grandmother , of course , of course , i think it &apos;s very special .
my first memory comes from the boat -- the air force , the  UNK  sea level of  UNK  .
and the lego on the lego is to draw the  UNK  , in the real world , using the building blocks of our buildings .
and it was the first mistake : i made her back home .
they &apos;re starting to build very specific structures in the community .
some of you may have heard of this .
in the u.s. , the institute of medicine has been 10 years old .
&quot; mr.  UNK  , did you write this  UNK  ? &quot;
and this is something that we &apos;re in time , which is kind of a  UNK  organism to grow in a cell .
there are three times three times .
mr. teszler &apos;s still  UNK  . he doesn &apos;t know where he was .
and this is really important .
we love the entertainment .
my mother makes us feel the hands of the grandmother .
you put it in blue , and you make a light .
for me , it takes me to spend a lot of time thinking about talking about the poor people , and the people who never would ever meet .
and there will be a little bit like this to a smartphone or a smartphone .
we don &apos;t really understand that history .
you add a little bit more  UNK  , and you can create a noise .
it &apos;s just a different reality .
what does it look like ?
and the best part is probably the medical system .
we love technology , we love .
the transistor is a small piece of plastic , and it &apos;s going to bring us into a kind of  UNK  , to the world a new world .
this video is actually uploaded to last year .
i went to court .
this is the innovation that &apos;s been created by technology .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
i tried to read and explain how they work .
and that &apos;s because of computers , the computer computers are used to produce faster and faster .
this is due to a heart attack , and it doesn &apos;t get all the blood pumped out of the blood , and the parts of the blood flows through the lungs .
in the right way , i made two mistakes .
think about it . in the middle of the in kenya in the middle of kenya in the middle of the united states , 25 years ago .
it &apos;s going to be a resource of resources .
and one time i was there , and i went to talk to them and i asked her , and she said , &quot; brian , i talk about you .
maybe we can skip -- i &apos;ll skip the video ...
we know that in the middle of all the  UNK  .
it was called  UNK  .
in fact , we &apos;ve changed the poverty of poverty .
what are they going to consume ? what &apos;s their wish ?
you see , these images are not special .
UNK  4 : the  UNK  of the  UNK
here &apos;s what we call a  UNK  .
and a friend of mine , a friend of mine was a wonderful video of a protest in new york city , and i had to admit that i had no interest .
and i have to tell you that it gives me a  UNK  .
but i remember the light from the oil  UNK  , which is from the coast of the coast , from the coast of  UNK  , from the  UNK  , and the the the the
it doesn &apos;t even have a technology company , more like the web itself .
and at the same time , we &apos;ve got three  UNK   UNK  , and we put some of them in  UNK  , just because of a bicycle , or a , or a , and a , , , ,
but what we &apos;re trying to do is complex things into sound , and a sound , and it &apos;s very complicated in your brain .
all of the soldiers were used by  UNK  , and they were  UNK  .
what if i look at all the people who are dying in the germans , who are afraid of the jews , and what would i feel ?
my grandfather gave me his life .
so the first principle is that all of the images of all of these  UNK  images .
and yet we don &apos;t understand it .
i &apos;ll never forget .
and when i came out of the medical school , i felt like i was able to take all of the things -- and all of the things that i had -- and all of the things that i did was ,
so now we &apos;re going to speed up again .
and one of the team , a guy named erik hersman  UNK  , and the other thing : the citizens will put these on the back of the  UNK  .
four years ago at ted , ray kurzweil and i started a new university called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
it could be  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , or  UNK   UNK  bins .
although they were very disappointed , they didn &apos;t complain about it , and trying to improve it .
and in fact , one of the things that i did was to do something about entertainment , which is what we can do with this code .
we &apos;re going to see this process .
a couple of hours later , when i say goodbye , she would come and ask me , &quot; can i feel my hug ? &quot;
she &apos;s got to be so close , and she &apos;s going to come back to me .
and every year we &apos;ve asked students to make a company or a product or a service or a service that could make a difference in a decade .
but together , they can create images like this .
crisis , death , disaster .
and she said , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
and i did a  UNK  speech , and when i ended up , she looked at me and said , &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
it may be  UNK  .
somehow somehow , we can &apos;t fully understand the way that we have to understand .
at the same time , the  UNK  today is going to be here today , the fourth , fourth fourth .
we have the development of technology and tools .
the judge said that he was a adults , but i just saw a child .
UNK  is not an easy game .
and i looked back to her , but she was very serious .
and i started to do the title of this quote : &quot; i &apos;m going to have a lot of my kids a little black child in the  UNK  . &quot;
ah , wait a minute .
it &apos;s a constant story .
in  UNK  , creative participation , ideas ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , the  UNK  of the new media and the  UNK  of the
but in the next two days , she would never be more likely to wake up .
and i don &apos;t remember the pirate  UNK  , and the  UNK  , the , the , the , the , the .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i think it &apos;s going to be something like this .
he drank a beer , and he handed my sister , and she was drinking , and they got me .
and it &apos;s a group of people who are smart people in the city of the city .
wealth is not the end of the end .
i can &apos;t be able to accept the  UNK  of our generation that we can actually play , so i decided to change it .
it &apos;s kind of like this .
because the real government is happening there .
some bacteria know how to get away from the penicillin , and it &apos;s going to make it  UNK  , and in the bacteria , and the bacteria we have , , because of bacteria
for example , how do you work , or how it works , or why it &apos;s going to be  UNK  , or how the ipod is reacting .
but it &apos;s a  UNK  age in this country .
he was a poet and  UNK  , and he had a unity of peace and freedom .
so this shows a little bit of what we do .
a lot of my students were young .
how does it work for this particular way to help ?
follow my hunch .
for instance , this picture is a  UNK  road next to .
in fact , i know , i &apos;m confident confident that they can do the task , because they come out of the way that they can do that .
and one night night , i &apos;m not going to say , oh my god , if you judge the other person , you know , the judge must be magic .
still , it still has a sense of  UNK  .
she &apos;s not going to have a kind of  UNK  mentality , and it &apos;s going to make a difference to everybody else in a way to understand other people .
at the high school , there was a group that had said to brian  UNK  .
in fact , their life is work .
i gave her back to my home .
this is what we &apos;re here today .
as humans , we are so good at the risk of crises , but we end up with them .
they want to tell their stories , and they want to share their stories .
it &apos;s a lot more than 40 years .
it will affect you .
and this is just a small number .
brian , you &apos;ve come up with you today .
people were running around , because everyone was angry .
even though it &apos;s on the left curve , it &apos;s still  UNK  .
let me tell you a little bit of that .
i &apos;m a physician .
what is this illusion ?
so here &apos;s the war on the road .
and what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to be the biggest economic growth of economic growth .
and at the same time , i realized that as a result , as a result , as a result , there was no news on the screen , but it was just a few things that came out of the boat .
in my view , a lot of it was completely changed the world .
the more you change , the faster changes .
at the end of the end , i got absolutely perfect  UNK  .
and the school stayed in the school , because it had to stay in six years .
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
but what happened on that day ?
some of them are  UNK  from a german company called  UNK  , a company called  UNK  , which is a  UNK  tool for the public .
rebecca  UNK  : one of the  UNK  of the year
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s not the way we use it .
in a health care system , it &apos;s going to be three years in the intensive care system , and we can &apos;t
and he reminded me that my identity is reminded me that everyone should be a society for society .
no , my time is already ?
it &apos;s a  UNK  -- a ted fellow -- he &apos;s a baseball player in a baseball league , and in the last 20 years .
there &apos;s no  UNK  center .
if he did a joke , he doesn &apos;t mean that he was a liar .
he &apos;s called the &quot;  UNK  &quot; .
today we &apos;re going to have a company that &apos;s going to
my patient wasn &apos;t a car , and they wouldn &apos;t be able to describe their symptoms .
the  UNK  is an electrical impulse , and each one has a specific function .
there &apos;s a switch .
and my performance is good , and in graduate school .
when i first started this project , i didn &apos;t know how to the government .
so what &apos;s more focused on is an inspiration , rather than a  UNK  moment .
in my show , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; and i &apos;m going to end up from the  UNK  to  UNK  , and i said , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; and then i &apos;m going to send the microphone and say , &quot; what ?
but there &apos;s another thing .
this is a real opportunity .
either it &apos;s going to be like a typical curve , and it &apos;s completely different .
&quot; because you &apos;re going to wake up in the morning , &quot; he said .
because evolution can happen in the individuals .
they come from our intellectual wisdom and our beliefs .
oh ...
over the past hundred years , the average lifespan has doubled two times more , and over the course of inflation , per capita income has increased three times .
and the key to the key to understanding is the subtle details of human language .
he just wanted to share a  UNK  .
and the cloud , i &apos;m calling it in a company called  UNK  , the sensors and the internet , robotics , robotics , 3d printing , which allows us to be able to generate the power of the production and the production of the production ; the  UNK  ; the  UNK  ; the ; .
one of the people who worked in the  UNK  department of hawaii , saw this program , and realized that it wasn &apos;t going to be able to get it back to the snow .
most of the time i work in in low-income communities , in the area of desperation .
or is it the light ?
don &apos;t start , you start with the invention .
&quot;  UNK  , &quot; she said , &quot; do it . &quot;
think about it , it &apos;s an amazing invention .
one of my diagnosis was diagnosed with him .
she said that three words : remember ?
my  UNK  knew her , so she could provide more detailed information .
let &apos;s apply this metaphor to other things .
but at the end , it &apos;s going to be about how we understand how the world and the understanding of the space itself .
and when she got home , she ignored me with a tiny little voice , and the voice tried to tell me , &quot; no , no , no , no . &quot;
in our culture , we have autonomy .
last year , we had a team of three people who had spent two months ago .
it costs every dollar . it costs all the money to buy english and math education , no matter how to wear clothes .
as i did , it was a justin bieber  UNK  .
my job is to remain awake , and when she was doing her .
and the third principle is to try to make a difference between these different pictures , and it &apos;s going to be  UNK  .
i was shocked , and it was  UNK  .
so when they deal with the government , they don &apos;t care about their words .
this is an example of how our government use technology to deal with our citizens .
in fact , we are so many of these cells .
it was in  UNK  , a  UNK  suburbs .
and it &apos;s very important for all of these things , but some people will steal the battery .
it &apos;s going to be  UNK  , and he
but in our country , in the south , we are actually in the middle of the -- not because , because the victim is not the , you the , because of a , the the , the , the the of , the of the of the of the of , the the of the of the
now , the second of the main group of  UNK  , what we &apos;re looking at today is not about money .
there was a possibility that could threaten a cause of life , called  UNK  .
and then , we were told , if this project was passed by normal , it would cost at least two years , and it costs about two million dollars .
and this change can come from a doctor , and that &apos;s me .
i still don &apos;t know how to see me , but i think i can do that .
they &apos;ll use their hands .
it &apos;s not just the employees in the united states , and there are hundreds of millions of people who are going to live in their own communities , and putting them in their own communities .
we have a  UNK  device .
in the course of the  UNK  , i didn &apos;t have found out that there were a lot of patients .
as a doctor , you can help someone , if you &apos;re a doctor doctor , you can help more .
because we live in a planet .
she was 17 years old to marry a  UNK  , and she was  UNK   UNK  .
but if the same patient in the same time , he had a little bit of a  UNK  , and i , , , i , ,
and we wanted to make this material .
so , you think , a doctor doctor , or a professional doctor , a professional surgeon , a doctor surgeon , a doctor , a doctor who is a doctor , or a  UNK  , or what a ?
it was about 15 minutes later , and she stood up to the room , through the room with my hand and said to me , &quot; come on , we &apos;ve got to talk about it . &quot;
it can help the parents decide whether the public school is best for their children .
we want to encourage a group of makers , inventors and inventors , because the world we live in this world , the world of us .
because it &apos;s not our problem .
i looked at the headlines of the newspapers , and i found the best .
but it helped me .
the mother started to work in rural village , and then went to a car , and a week later , six days .
we can &apos;t talk about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we don &apos;t want to be in a series of facts , not .
but it does anything else that can &apos;t do anything .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t want to drink . you drink . &quot;
they sell them .
now , the next week is going to be  UNK  .
ladies and gentlemen , giving me a huge amount of confidence in the future , and every single one of our individual is being challenged by the challenges of the world .
this is a program that allows you to take a  UNK   UNK  .
if we were beaten , my sister , my mother and my grandmother .
and every one of them has a similar project .
the chicago started to use it to make a beeline for the snow .
but recently , what &apos;s going to save the patient &apos;s  UNK  ?
so now , evolution is going to happen in a subtle period of time .
chris : there &apos;s a big decline in over 30 years .
today , there are  UNK  .
privacy is not talking about .
and she said , &quot; you &apos;re a special child . &quot;
i &apos;d like to talk about one of the data that i &apos;d like .
any of you will ever be at the end of the web .
and there are no more important information that we have to do with all of the information that are in the temporal lobe , which is a very primitive part of the brain .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; and he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; and i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
my mother had a couple of minutes .
my  UNK  are always everywhere .
even in the end of the weekend , there are different kinds of  UNK  .
and these principles are my own belief that we should persist .
the nurse came up and said , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think there &apos;s no problem . &quot;
this is not the state of the state in the country .
after a few days later , he was cured .
even though aluminum is  UNK  percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but it &apos;s not  UNK  .
now , the next piece is the dawn of the dawn of the dawn of  UNK  , the  UNK  of the sea .
we built the center .
and this is going to put that money on the law and the  UNK  .
this is moore &apos;s law in the last hundred years .
slowly , slowly , it &apos;s awful .
and their motive comes out of the  UNK  -- the  UNK  , the  UNK  .
i &apos;m happy .
and they talk about other people to talk about ourselves .
she had a huge increase in her this year , and she had a recovery .
so this system has evolved to evolve , and it can make a lot easier to do that , and we can make a sense of the wrong solution , and at the same time , we can create a  UNK  environment , and to each one of those who are looking at some of the things that we
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
and then people were able to measure their blood pressure , and then they send the data back to the doctors and send them to the doctors and other people to share with a hundred dollars .
and this process is  UNK  , and it becomes , i guess , should be  UNK  -- the speed of the speed .
a few days later , we went to  UNK   UNK  , sitting next to her .
it &apos;s kind of like a simple chemical form of life , but it &apos;s interesting , and it &apos;s really interesting when it comes to the skill of the .
and if we look at what &apos;s going on in the online world , what we &apos;re going to do is
sadly , it wasn &apos;t just that i was writing .
why did i have my connection ? why did i get her home ?
we also want to be  UNK  . &quot;
he was my grandfather .
the brain is the early warning of our early  UNK  .
the biggest threat is  UNK  , rape and death .
and i &apos;m also  UNK  .
okay , let &apos;s look at it .
so if you go back for about 25 billion years , the earth is large , and the big bubble , the big rock , and it &apos;s bigger .
and then the seattle decided to put money back to the  UNK  of the
but this picture is actually a whole series of photos of different pictures .
they want to say , &quot; listen ,  UNK  and me . &quot;
in the next two hours , she starts to get better .
our survival and our survival of survival .
when we &apos;re dealing with these problems , we are still paying attention to those positive things .
thank you .
in the future , most of the crime will happen online .
every hundred minutes per day , 16 percent of the energy consumption .
and this is happening in these groups .
first of all , it &apos;s very smooth -- whether it &apos;s good , whether it &apos;s good or bad , whether or war or peace .
and each of those blobs , represents the size of the performance .
and that &apos;s not because it &apos;s not my wife ; it &apos;s very good .
and these programs allow us to take our own hands to our society .
and we want to talk about the companies in the world to help us with these things .
but our lives are much richer .
in south africa , people know that we can &apos;t forget that unless we are honest , unless we &apos;re honest .
and the second thing that i did was more serious .
she came up with a computer store , and she was able to learn a  UNK  .
because i believe that human beings have a fundamental dignity that has to respect it .
her  UNK  rate was  UNK  .
i spent most of the time in prison , in prison , in death row .
the cost of food , the cost of transportation , transportation costs , 10 times more than 1,000 times .
two  UNK  : famine .  UNK  : the police use  UNK  .
so here , we have a  UNK  , mr.  UNK  .
and we wanted to put each of these individual elements in the world with a single  UNK  .
so far , how many of our political leaders -- and sometimes we spend a huge amount of time to support a new political leaders in the political system -- and we expect the government to do something about the values that we need to do , but how much does it happen ?
and i believe that we need to give people a lot more people who don &apos;t give them more than they are .
the infant mortality dropped 10 times .
over the next few weeks , i was so frustrated by the first time , and the first experience that i was suffering in medicine , and i wasn &apos;t feeling helpless . it &apos;s not a healthy sense of shame , because you can &apos;t talk about your colleagues .
and if you &apos;re going to have a chance to work in your city center , and our colleagues scott &apos;s doing this -- and in fact , they all need to do this service -- and you &apos;ll see that people are going to find people in a very different question , and it &apos;s a  UNK  .
and if that &apos;s what it means , it means we &apos;re going to be  UNK  .
i &apos;m not a robot that doesn &apos;t do the same thing .
it &apos;s getting faster , and that &apos;s why i think the computer seems like this .
and it all happened to me .
and finally , she said , &quot; the third thing , i &apos;m going to give you a drink . &quot;
for example , most extreme , we actually can actually start with a sequence of a sequence of a sequence .
the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
and she said , &quot; first , i want you to make sure that you will love your mother . &quot;
and the medical culture of her work has acknowledged that the whole system is governed by people , and when they &apos;re operating in a system , it doesn &apos;t work .
his answer was yes .
it &apos;s very difficult to imagine what happens when you get a hospital in a hospital .
so i &apos;m going to do a few minutes a few hundred years to do a thousand years of evolution , or in a few years .
and it &apos;s about the fact that people don &apos;t want to talk about the worst mistakes of their  UNK  .
this is  UNK   UNK  .
and i directly directly from one piece of  UNK  , and it &apos;s not beautiful .
she said , &quot; we don &apos;t have a death penalty .
and at the end , i said , my grandmother .
but what they really want to do is to show the possibilities of technology today .
i had a  UNK  ,  UNK  , a black kid .
imagine that he was as a as a  UNK  into the whole life .
UNK  is relative , and technology is a force of resources .
it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s not the case that we &apos;ve got to be informed .
but there &apos;s an interesting thing that &apos;s going to start to be totally different , and that &apos;s where these cells are going to exchange exchange and exchange .
the first step of the story that i &apos;m going to talk about is doubling every year .
what do they want ?
that &apos;s an incredible experience .
because this talk is everywhere .
you don &apos;t talk about the wine .
in order to do this , i have to introduce a bunch of things , and it doesn &apos;t matter .
sometimes she learns english , and they get a  UNK  .
we want to change the death penalty .
i am a human , and i &apos;m going to be wrong .
we move forward to the next 10 years , which is the ratio of the rights of the
this is not our struggle .
it &apos;s great . it &apos;s awesome .
and by the way , the best way to prevent the population growth of the population growth is to get more people in the world .
i said , &quot; sir , i &apos;m writing . &quot;
and then i &apos;ll just say , just listen .
so it &apos;s  UNK  .
and in fact , what i &apos;ve done is , what i do is , what we do is , we think of what we &apos;re doing , and we think we &apos;re going to do it for a , and we &apos;re going to use it to the , to the , and more and more we than
it &apos;s a  UNK  . it &apos;s  UNK  .
at the end of the night , and every time you go to a dinner party , and every time she had two friends at  UNK  , and she was a woman named  UNK   UNK  -- she was  UNK  , who was a  UNK  black woman named  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
and this is one of the projects that they did with a  UNK   UNK  .
so a organism can be , for example , to learn how to eat a little bit , because it doesn &apos;t smell , and it &apos;s disgusting .
that &apos;s great .
we &apos;re never going to do this in our own country .
why not ?
now there are a lot of people who are completely  UNK  .
and there &apos;s a complicated thing in my mind , and chaos , thinking .
for the children of the child , it &apos;s not .
my mom is the youngest in the 10 .
by 2020 , the internet will be coming from 20 billion to 50 billion .
i got everything .
and when i listened to the  UNK  , she listened to me , and the voice of my voice was telling me that this was a  UNK  heart failure .
some people say you &apos;re never going to forget the names of the dead .
and it also shows how it works , and it &apos;s still more than the best computer in the best computers .
i want you to pay attention to the two things that you see .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t do it . you &apos;re drinking . i don &apos;t drink . &quot;
but today , it &apos;s beyond .
and the best thing is that they &apos;re  UNK  .
when i was more depressed , i would ask : why would i make a stupid mistake ?
the 70 percent of the earth is covered by water .
it &apos;s going to be on a new generation .
maybe i don &apos;t want to be a  UNK  .
in the history of technology , it doesn &apos;t have any kind of  UNK  , it &apos;s doubling every year .
this graph shows that the video of this video is just in the  UNK  .
and that &apos;s why we can &apos;t really understand what we &apos;ve ever done .
but thailand &apos;s  UNK   UNK  .
with the science fiction , michael  UNK  , who &apos;s watching his video on his page .
if you &apos;re a  UNK   UNK  , it &apos;s obvious , you &apos;re  UNK  .
and if i say , &quot; it doesn &apos;t feel like , &quot; she said , &quot; and she said , &quot; i feel like , &quot; she &apos;s got me .
and the thing is that , when you beat the promise of the promise of the warrior , and he said , &quot; you know , you know , you you know , you you &apos;re , you you , , you you , , you you , , you you , , you you &apos;re you &apos;re ,
and if they use a smartphone to google , they will get more knowledge than ever before .
and i &apos;m going to talk about technology , and it &apos;s fresh .
and every day , i would like to make a lot of them .
in  UNK  , they chose to leave her off the  UNK  -- the lady , a family , mother , grandmother , grandmother , grandmother .
and carl sagan said , and she put her hand up and said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;re very brave . &quot;
and i walked down to the side of the line , the outside .
we need to enable technology to help the people who are going to be able to .
thank you .
so imagine a group of students that can affect the lives of a billion people .
i &apos;m sorry sorry , but i &apos;m going to try and learn to learn from others .
and she said , &quot; i want you to do three things . &quot;
her breathing is very faint ,  UNK   UNK  .
so this is good . this is the reality of the world and the digital world .
tan le  UNK  , which is the refugees , which is a community , social activist , and invited to speak to a place that nobody has ever seen before .
so let me share with you a story , and i &apos;m very excited about this story .
so in my view , i &apos;m going to focus on the right track and time .
30 billion dollars , educated , educated , what are the members of society in society ?
steve  UNK  : we point out that we live in the most peaceful time in human history .
so what you need to do is to put the blue into the green , and then you &apos;re going to start making more complicated circuits .
when i talk to her , i hear her breath .
so the  UNK  is a pulse , and here you can create a little  UNK  .
these people have a lot of money online , but they &apos;re paid to be illegal logging , which is illegal logging , and when we &apos;re on the internet , we &apos;re putting our credit card , or when we &apos;re on the web , we &apos;re using our online computer , we &apos;re using our online computer
we have a sense of our intuition , which is directly linked to our conclusion , for example , i can make the perfect record for a  UNK  patient .
my god , at the end of 2013 , the mobile phone is going to be 70 percent .
so let &apos;s go back to my world -- and i &apos;m very familiar with this , but what i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is what we &apos;re doing with  UNK   UNK  , which is the  UNK   UNK  of the internet .
but it might be .
because this is true for every individual -- learning can happen in a  UNK  period of time , not as the evolution of evolution .
and if we look at these chemicals , we begin to figure out how they form .
the fear of the fear of anger and anger is that we don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s an interesting aspect of light .
the police went out of the police , and they came in .
this is the service of the service and information .
i just wanted to mention a platform for people to help each other .
and then we sat down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know you &apos;re looking at the time . &quot;
he &apos;s on the left .
and by looking at the colors of the different colors , the  UNK  and the  UNK  of the and the , , of , , of , the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
look at this curve .
so now this is where we &apos;re starting to work as a single organism .
this gave them the evolution of evolution .
and we also calls for our colleagues around the world and universities to help us bring together the  UNK  of the world .
he was saying to me .
and the whole thing is made out of the whole thing , and this is just a joke , and it &apos;s just a joke that you can get involved in .
people are afraid to be attacked .
every single one in this generation is just a few milliseconds .
you &apos;re not  UNK  .
but we don &apos;t care .
now , when you put the best protein in the world , not a professor at mit , it &apos;s not a graduate student at the university of pennsylvania , and it &apos;s the best of the the the the the the the the the the the the
let &apos;s look at the example of a company called  UNK  .
and it was amazing , because at the end of the talk , there was a guy who stood up and said , &quot; you know , listen to this . &quot;
now this is the best thing to replicate it .
oh , that &apos;s day , a friday , really .
we &apos;re not alone , we are .
it took me out of my love of painting , but i had a little bit , because it was a little bit , because the camera was completed .
my sister and my mother and i was sleeping with a bed .
jimmy wales : a  UNK  that makes the video
you can see what happens in the world .
but every time i thought about it , it would hurt me .
she &apos;s going to share her experience with other people .
the president of coke was recently conducted in developing countries in the developing world .
our average age was 28 years old , so i was very , very , very much older than most of them .
if we have the energy energy , we have a lot of water .
so a judge , how could it be a person to a person ?
and if you have this device to the rna , or dna sequencing , it doesn &apos;t recognize , and it &apos;s going to call the disease for the first time of the disease .
and then in a sunny day , when i saw a  UNK  of the sunlight , i thought i could feel it again .
we have to do it as a society society .
but that &apos;s not the end of the story .
now i want my own child , and i &apos;m going to my own .
i think there &apos;s a cultural culture in which we have to start changing .
now there &apos;s a very large group of building that can make us more efficient .
and every mother &apos;s  UNK  home , but we &apos;re going to talk to each other day , listen to the sounds of the room .
and the bear with mr.  UNK  , the  UNK  rainbow , and it &apos;s like , of course , all over the place .
but ultimately , the good reality is  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , human rights .
and finally , people will say that society is not going to be based on how we &apos;re wealthy , but we have a lot of people who are willing to vote for people who are  UNK  , who are the people who are being killed by people .
as you can see , this is an example of how you &apos;ve seen , and it &apos;s as if you look at it in the front of your eyes .
no wonder people feel the world .
it &apos;s just a little bit to her .
and when i met the woman , she was very faint .
seeking money and funding .
there &apos;s no choice .
in egypt , the  UNK  of egypt  UNK  egypt in egypt , and they were able to find a lot of documents .
in the cities of the country -- in los angeles -- in philadelphia , philadelphia , baltimore , maryland , maryland ,  UNK  -- the young people who are in prison , not in prison .
and if it &apos;s successful , i &apos;m confident that it will be successful , and it &apos;s going to be on a global  UNK  .
by the way , i put the house on the island of red , and it would look like the wind up .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
the doctor is defined as human beings , and she understands that she is , and she deserves the truth , and she doesn &apos;t think that it &apos;s going to be
absolutely absolutely impossible to make false mistakes -- but we let them think about how to do it .
you know , you &apos;ve got a commitment commitment , and you &apos;re not going to
privacy is  UNK  .
and i did .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s very beautiful , it &apos;s wonderful , and it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , but we &apos;re not going to be that we &apos;re not going to
UNK  ? very good .
it allows us to create something that &apos;s more about building , buildings , bridges , and this is the  UNK  .
it means that we don &apos;t have permission .
and it works . scott .
and i was really nervous . i was nervous .
so these are three main messages that are paid to pay for the money , the perpetrator of anonymous ,  UNK  , and the last group is the nation-state .
the skin cell doesn &apos;t work , if you don &apos;t have the heart cells , muscle cells , cells , cells , etc .
and race , we have a  UNK  death penalty .
so what i want to say is that we &apos;re going to have three simple principles to do this .
and for those  UNK  , the  UNK  became a kind of material material , which is just a material .
these two patients have done surgery and recovery .
and how do i teach them , let them stop me ?
thank you .
in the 1980s , in the late 1980s , if you have a typewriter , you have to go to the government .
and there are also three people who are going to come up with the challenges that we &apos;re working together to collaborate together , and we have to do what we need to do .
and then i went back to the  UNK  and the  UNK  , and then , and then , back then , back then , until .
her family had joined together .
now , you &apos;re going to run all of these random instructions , and all of these things , and all of them together .
a few centuries of life is not changed .
it causes a form of cells -- and they &apos;re happy .
but i was afraid of privilege ,  UNK  and power .
as a history , he &apos;s dead .
and that &apos;s really bad .
we need to find a way to deal with these challenges .
and he saw me , and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
so every time we open the newspaper , we don &apos;t read the negative information .
the innovation , innovation , development , not just in our brains .
UNK   UNK  : i took a ticket , because i didn &apos;t ride on bike lanes , but it was a lot of obstacles that you couldn &apos;t afford to ride on bike lanes .
there &apos;s energy ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
because it &apos;s exactly what we really want to start to understand what we &apos;re looking at .
because as an  UNK  , it &apos;s easy to give up an assumption , it &apos;s easy to get your assumptions .
UNK  6 :  UNK   UNK  : seven .
and she said , &quot; i &apos;m sure you &apos;re a . &quot;
last month , i &apos;ve been a great honor to have a $ 100 million dollars , and i &apos;m going to have a
for 10 minutes , i &apos;m going to tell you about the story of the women of the women and the women , and the , and her , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
her brain had been paralyzed by damage .
the great progress of our society in the 20th century has been expanding accelerated , and in fact , the speed that we have in the next 30 years .
if you &apos;re in the city of your city , you will be connected to here .
a citizen will help another citizen , and the government plays a role .
and i wanted to go back to the end of the  UNK  , the -- the , the , the , the , the , and , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , ,
it &apos;s going to go crazy .
they learn how to put them into a specific material called  UNK  .
so i think it &apos;s really simple .
so there are three things that you can imagine , and in fact , we can actually find them in the three-dimensional world .
so i &apos;m going to talk about how it &apos;s going to happen .
we all want to be a star -- celebrity , singer , singer -- and when i was young , it was very , very difficult .
thank you .
if he took his name , it doesn &apos;t mean that he was a  UNK  .
i work now to design the computer , and i know that the mechanisms of design computers can &apos;t exist , and there &apos;s no progress on the computer .
these are all connected together , and we &apos;ve got bigger , faster than we have .
and i &apos;m not trying to learn from a lawyer or doing something else .
they put the tools for a million euros .
this is a story of a  UNK  story in  UNK  .
what i &apos;m going to do is , you know ,  UNK  , like any other state , if you &apos;re convicted of your political power .
and if i &apos;m an  UNK  person , i &apos;ll put it in the virus into the room .
there &apos;s a  UNK  technology .
oh , wow .
in fact , i was so confident that i couldn &apos;t even afford to take care of the nurses , and i said , &quot; do you think she &apos;s going to get home ? &quot;
so , the western government gave the tools to governments , against their own citizens .
you have to go out of a piece of paper .
and i think of it as a place in the real world , where you can connect the real world in the real world .
he talked to that with his family , and i was sure that he was going to make sure that i wasn &apos;t going to be interrupted .
these anonymous companies are very active in the last 12 months , and become a major part of the attack .
so let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on in the last century .
now , we don &apos;t really have to improve our institutions , and we really believe that we can achieve what we want to do ?
and the friends of the friends .
i have to say , really , really .
and this is the basis of technology , and technology is exponential technology .
and she reminded me that she took us when we were going to go to the house , which was my age .
but it hasn &apos;t changed .
because this is what &apos;s called &quot;  UNK   UNK  . &quot;
so what &apos;s next ?
but it &apos;s this kind of  UNK  that we have that we have and we pay for what we need to pay for it , and we &apos;re losing our own energy .
kevin : what does that mean ?
the  UNK  taste of the  UNK  is from another .
so they &apos;re going to die together or die , which means that if a community has succeeded , all the individuals in the community can replicate more .
and then he looked at me for a while , and i said , &quot; oh , you don &apos;t think about it . &quot;
and i gave him some liquid to help him , and he gave me a lot of my colleagues .
we don &apos;t like to talk about history .
how are you going to talk about this ?
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also .
it was  UNK  by the mother .
UNK  !
what they need is a medical culture .
this is not participation in politics , but it &apos;s a  UNK  .
and so i talked about  UNK  unemployment and education , the  UNK  and the political rights .
this is a woman who said , &quot; because our history of our history , we may not have a  UNK  .
let me show you how to play .
it may sound a little creepy , and i &apos;m a  UNK   UNK  .
we set up a website to tell people , &quot; if you look at an automated  UNK  , it &apos;s going to open up to the location of the web , and it &apos;s because it doesn &apos;t have to be open .
in the last five years , i &apos;ve made some mistakes .
right ? yes . it &apos;s alive .
and i think that all of us are part of it , whatever it is .
and finally , i finally got the car , and i went to court .
i don &apos;t want to do it . i want to end with a story .
it sends all the information and all of this information , and it can be possible in any kind of threats .
i said , &quot; okay ,  UNK  . &quot;
and he said , &quot; when we &apos;re dealing with the problem in eastern europe , we hope that we can make a lot , but most importantly , we &apos;re going to have a desire to be , and to the , and to the
today , i &apos;m going to talk about some unexpected discoveries .
UNK  is a authority .
one of the things that we did in the netherlands at the university of illinois was to be a  UNK  .
to give their lives ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , ,
and now we have all kinds of digital devices , and we &apos;re going to do all kinds of things . we don &apos;t have a lot easier .
sometimes these ideas are so much , and it &apos;s very serious .
is it about the details ?
it &apos;s a question of freedom .
and of course , we will never have a death penalty . &quot;
this year was the first time in india , the cost of solar energy to reduce the cost of fossil fuels .
but i can hold it , and look at them , and that &apos;s what i hope .
in 2010 , we have a population of 20 billion people .
it &apos;s a very good question .
i don &apos;t know .
in other words , what i &apos;m going to do .
yes , if you go to a party , you might hear some of the other bad things , but you don &apos;t hear about the wrong mistake .
we &apos;re going to be a few decades .
and then you can start the slide .
when we decided to correct the right , we could make the world that they would never have .
because it &apos;s not really what you can do , but i want to make it look like a  UNK  way .
don &apos;t .
that &apos;s what happens in the  UNK  .
and i gave her some  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  her  UNK  .
and finally , the black guy came in , and i was worried about the  UNK  in the back of me .
there &apos;s charles  UNK  , which has been shown in the last 20 years , from 25 percent of the last 25 years .
i think the reason is that we &apos;re feeling what &apos;s going on .
but i still work .
however , we don &apos;t like to talk about it .
i came to three months later , and i &apos;m going to take risks .
and what i learned is that the wrong is absolutely everywhere .
it sounds strange , right ?
