and who can predict predict this ?
and then she sat down , looking at me and said , &quot; you want to know that she &apos;s always in your leg . &quot;
we  UNK  in  UNK  , the suburbs of the people in labor camps .
there &apos;s a  UNK  reduction across 20 feet of an oyster  UNK  , with a  UNK  ascent .
now i &apos;m working in the solar industry .
three brothers , but also .
that &apos;s when you &apos;re talking about the political and the remodeling in the  UNK  and all of the things that make us feel angry , government , and the core of the heart , in the words of the  UNK  , &quot; they responded to act . &quot;
we can &apos;t get this issue .
who can predict &quot; h  UNK  &quot; or &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
this is  UNK   UNK  from  UNK  , estonia .
bjorn  UNK  .
that means the ball is out of the surface , it &apos;s gone down , it &apos;s not arrested , and the first you want to throw the  UNK  on the  UNK  , and i was safe .
and this guy &apos;s got up to stand up and look at the street , and he &apos;s looking at me , and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to talk about this young man or  UNK  in order to justice . &quot;
one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not like the politics .
her three days after she was born .
i was in the desert , under the desert , in the same way , like  UNK  singers ,  UNK  ali .
and so when we started the part of the night , and i had a conversation with her .
we can solve a lot more granular than we solve these options .
when i was a little kid , my grandfather went to me to the  UNK  of the north .
i think we have to do something about a traditional media in the medical need to change .
well , this is wrong , right ?
i asked to leave the water to make that the dune and the children to teach him .
and their  UNK  will explode , they &apos;re going to be fearful , and then they &apos;re going to look down and down the ceilings and start telling them to their story .
but today , oil don &apos;t really exist , like we &apos;re talking about , because it &apos;s all the random pattern of chemicals .
then one day -- this is actually a report -- something that happens : &quot; a  UNK  rat in the trash .
and what &apos;s below is we call the bureaucratic administrative machine .
and then i decided i &apos;m going to go to the supreme court and got this crazy idea .
and each other would be able to be able to be able to sit in their own backyard , and then send the data that i could share with others , and it cost more than 100 dollars .
on every morning i stand up .
they look for the wealth from the web , through the same way as the use of treating the banks of the banking system to send money from our account when we do online , or with the robot software that allows us to  UNK  information from the computer .
the smell from the coming from the world .
everybody &apos;s helping each other , but the government has to be the core role here .
they . wait for a little bit .
and at the same time i realized that made the jellyfish was made , the new ones , all the time -- and not just the , but it &apos;s a thing that we need to be grateful , maybe a gift from the boat .
but finally , in fact , in fact , this is still forbidden by the  UNK  , the lack of moral and moral ambiguity .
and if people look at how chemicals are formed , we start to understand how they form .
when i think that &apos;s going to be daunting .
the way of thinking about this is not the person who i have  UNK  or whether we have to kill ?
no .
now , it turns out that you even have to choose to have more options , and there are negative consequences .
but again , they can make something like this .
and these are not the characteristics of the medium , and as well as almost as the result of the tradition of today , but they will determine how the future of the future .
we make the past the past that people can &apos;t realize it because the  UNK  has collapsed and republicans at the bottom level .
even the kittens are watching this video .
you &apos;re busy .
most people understand that , but they think that this is the other .
because the organizers of  UNK  like jimmy  UNK  presents us to something interesting and exciting as well as well as well .
and there &apos;s an awful silence .
however , i would still say , i was 52 , and i would admit that i had never been an airstrip .
so in other words , the future seems to be a year for a year .
it &apos;s not our burden .
i &apos;ve never met him .
thank you .
this is not ...
but ultimately it leads to how we make the world and how to figure it on the surface .
after two years , i pulled out specifically specifically to the local authorities , about mice .
failure failure .
this allows us to communities that bacteria form that in the organism including these  UNK  categories ; they &apos;re working together .
it &apos;s for those who can see the forces that are preserved , and those who can benefit from the insights that it brings to what makes them back to their  UNK  .
and i said , &quot; well , sir , sir , and then we started to argue .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think i &apos;m doing right right now , is the ethical ; i want to talk about the power of human intelligence .
and that is the connection of the heart and the fog , the fog and my belief that i believe that we &apos;re not just paying attention to these things , but it &apos;s difficult .
the green is , the green sea is , fat is the  UNK  and the trick .
silence deprivation .
this is an example of what &apos;s going to happen when the government does their bidding .
and at the end , i &apos;m going to have an incredible program with the numbers .
because there are billions of transistors .
and there &apos;s no transition in the history of technological growth by changing the size of the past .
when this person gets to the other , our community becomes more powerful .
if i started with you , i learned how to make choices .
but in fact , what the other thing we see is that if you &apos;re willing to get rid of a lot of the choices that will decrease the pension growth rate down , and that &apos;s improved in the choices of options .
we &apos;ve got some great presentations .
and what we have , we now know that this is the sea .
so what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to change the show of those decisions .
but what do we do with it ?
it &apos;s not what we need to fight , attempts .
this has been taken out in this case from the bottom , or the  UNK  , which is a mess .
if i had to go into a room room , my colleagues and help them tell you what i &apos;d like to tell you , i &apos;ll never tell you two things before they feel very well , they &apos;ll be able to talk about that , and they &apos;ll be able to continue .
but it doesn &apos;t just stop there .
now i &apos;m going to warn you to try to be a bit like that we have to have a lot of challenges with when we don &apos;t pay attention .
i began to work with you with this petition , &quot; you &apos;ve been trying to help a seven-year-old kid who is as a director of on-demand service , white , 75 . &quot;
you just take away from the animals .
so now , what i do is to design work with sophisticated complexity that seems to be in the traditional way .
and she said , &quot; do you get it ? &quot;
i had my colleagues that i was convinced me that i actually didn &apos;t actually come .
the neuron system , the fact that they form these special structures , has accelerated progress .
&quot; well , we &apos;re trying to change the injustice .
well , i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yeah , i promise . &quot;
i actually think it &apos;s a lot of suffering where the poor is the status quo .
but it did something that &apos;s not a government to do .
so , one day , i decided to give you the manager , and i asked , &quot; what new people call these options ?
is there a little bit about ?
we &apos;re going through the same as the living organisms that have been working on , the  UNK  method , expression of information .
then there was a trip .
her parents were born in slave slave in 2005 .
when i was 14 , 15 years old , and i was about home , and i was about six feet of beer , i didn &apos;t know what he was coming from her head , and i had my father .
and so here , you need to be the ipad , to get away from .
my mother was paralyzed by the ark .
they were scared of bombs .
the more you have the more choice , all the money , all of their money into the financial markets .
and they start forming some of these special forces that are not working differently .
so i &apos;m going to go right now .
and they don &apos;t tell us a lot .
we &apos;re actually working on i.q. tests .
they stayed there .
and anytime you &apos;re in a city like  UNK  , who met someone , you could use your iphone , and in a couple of weeks that i could run the phone of the microsoft to find the nearest  UNK  .
this is the  UNK  of brilliant people in the office office in boston .
it &apos;s in our feet when we move forward .
my mother worked in the farm , and then in the production of the car , and weeks weeks later , two days .
when the transplant is sliced in the middle of your garage , and you see the increase in the revenues , and a half of the cost of the cost .
how can i show you 10 minutes of the spectrum of the women who are over three generations , about how amazing  UNK  are taken off the life of a little girl with her little girl , with her mother and her life on the  UNK  boat in the last 30 years ago , these  UNK  are going to come out of my life and never talk to you today ?
i think if someone is lying , they &apos;re not a liar .
i know that this talk is going to be authorized .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about ourselves .
i don &apos;t believe that .
moreover , we are the citizens .
and today we want to introduce this machine not only that this product is called , but it &apos;s  UNK  .
and she took me out of the room , out behind the house , and said , &quot; hey , she would tell you what i don &apos;t . &quot;
every year is used to be able to learn and how to learn english and math is because whatever it comes out of pressure , often it &apos;s a new clothes ; because we &apos;re at all time .
in rwanda , even after the genocide of the incident , there was a commitment to the place in this country , we haven &apos;t been able to do that .
the people who invented the creation of creative commons , but it &apos;s all going to be now , is the characteristics of a traditional new kind of traditional form and new culture where anyone can access to and audiences .
today we &apos;re going to spend some time to talk about how video games are made in a short time , and then the reason why this is going to talk about .
each tool is right here , and the only thing that is our limitations .
she said to us that as usual , to build a software that would take two hours and cost about two million dollars .
and there are seven million people who are  UNK  or  UNK  .
when i was disappointed .
a lot of my city still are still small .
there &apos;s something odd here .
can you write something like this ?
boston is not just a  UNK  .
there are many cases like what happened in  UNK  .
but then , it &apos;s a very interesting stage , it &apos;s interesting to become something different , it &apos;s when these cells start exchanging information and communication information , and shaped the cells .
five percent of the  UNK  didn &apos;t work .
you know , it &apos;s  UNK  .
what do you think you &apos;re at best ?
in the next book , we &apos;re going to have an interactive activity that you &apos;re going to open up with a video of video , and this is augmented reality , you see this  UNK   UNK  on the outside of your home .
it was an earthquake for a few years ago .
but in this -- what i do is i &apos;m going to make this code -- the code from the standards we use to humanize it -- and i wrote my business on a piece of dna and it &apos;s 10 to 22 times .
the other students helps students to the public schools to fit their children .
they use the online activities to make a lot of money , a lot of money .
in fact , i &apos;m afraid of confident that i was asking her to nurse , she said , &quot; do you think she she &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
somebody has incorporated into the system and destroying it .
&quot; do you remember your head ? &quot;
it &apos;s something deeply deeply embedded in the human nature , for the contribution of each other people for community , for open-minded thinking .
in the astronaut industry , we &apos;re never going to let people go to bed nets , take a plane .
but that &apos;s the best thing that happens is that &apos;s called the pressure of pressure , the pressure of the patient has been used to patients -- since it &apos;s used to be obese , it can also use the patients in the pill .
for example , this is a ceremony we did in tokyo .
we made an app on the  UNK   UNK  to find the  UNK  device .
he was his grandfather .
the difference is that they &apos;re aware of sync .
at the high school , you also go to the class where the test pilot is  UNK  .
here you say , &quot; let &apos;s put your hands on the lights . &quot;
that time , when the  UNK  , the  UNK   UNK   UNK  , when you  UNK  , don &apos;t steal the  UNK  , don &apos;t click on the ground and water will explode .
the rest of them used to only six years old , suddenly , when we see it 30 percent of them .
what we do is we put in a machine that happens to happen in the process of the small cycle .
their war is not like what we &apos;re not going to be the hero ; they all have to do that .
and of course , we &apos;re never going to have a dead punishment in germany . &quot;
they sell them .
that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of our identity .
but there are over 48 hours of video games on youtube .
and that &apos;s my message when i studied school .
i wanted to represent the voice for children .
by the way , it &apos;s an  UNK  player .
life is in the 21st century .
hello . i &apos;m kevin  UNK  . i &apos;m the  UNK  &apos;s youtube , and i watch videos on youtube .
if you think the image on the left is , and the right is to be jazz .
this room is silent , and this woman said , &quot; in our history , we &apos;ve been involved in a  UNK  system .
scott is this .
it &apos;s only supported by the other people talk about their mistakes .
because if you can stand in your body , we could easily be able to tolerate the preconceived in your region .
when she was three , i had a little verse in my lap , i said to me , &quot; well , it &apos;s not a good idea . don &apos;t work . &quot;
of the people stop when we gave the 24 24 , only three percent of them bought a bottle .
it &apos;s pretty simple .
after a hundred years , in 1947 , this was introduced .
that &apos;s an honor for me to be here and i share with everybody .
they seem to move like this .
before i went to , the  UNK   UNK  , and they were angry at us about the status quo , about poverty , and about silence .
so what makes the picture in the real , i think , it &apos;s the things that we &apos;ve never been thinking about , the things around us everyday life .
when a friend of mine told me that i need to see this great video of  UNK  people in new york city , i had to admit i &apos;m not interested in .
thank you very much .
and you increase the damage and never again .
if you &apos;re having a doubt that relates to a crime , it &apos;s definitely your phone .
and the first thing i did was to ask people to say , &quot; tell me how different choices .
now these are two different types .
but this argument is not rational .
the most exciting thing to do is when children start to understand the activity of the daily devices around the things that they don &apos;t learn at school .
at the beginning , i thought we were playing a game .
and these creatures seem to be comfortable as there .
so there &apos;s a lot of motivation for this .
so i began to speak out .
i would like to suggest the taliban .
you &apos;ve heard that before , but it &apos;s not less than less .
i went from my wife , it was a 13-year-old 13-year-old boy , 14 years old , and he was allowed to stand before .
the result is more than 10,000 version of jackson pollock &quot; on youtube .
and this is the point that patients can take control over and collected data on their health , not only to control their own self-interest , but also helps us in the health care of health care , we need to take advantage of the health care , the need to be able to double and to something like that .
because we were and and the lives of us were , we could see that men were able to walk into our lives .
and my patient is not alone -- not every one of them all over the same way .
in other words , every home represents a level of the ladder .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember this .
i &apos;d like to take a daily blog and the pursuit of life in the middle of nowhere -- none of her mother and the two daughters every day every day every day for the last 20 years , every single one of every single day in the day of sleep , three of us were still a bed .
the judge was an adult , but i saw him still a child .
that &apos;s the presence of us are intimately in relation to the human existence .
now , it shows that you &apos;re right .
do you know how much a choice in a week ?
alfred  UNK  .
we work at night .
what do you tell you for this ?
i went through the emergency room on the street .
it &apos;s amazing , after my presentation , she said , &quot; i &apos;m so hard to listen to what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
but the problem is that : if i can &apos;t tell you about my mistake , if i &apos;d like to lose my mind to know what &apos;s actually happening , how do i do with my colleagues ?
i &apos;ve been trying to be asking for the public system .
you have more than a couple of different decisions , to finish your car .
last year , we have a team in boston in the program room program .
does anybody want to be their children ?
some of these times in the book , it will show you the secret in it .
if we want to be able to do our own government , we have to make it better .
we adjust our  UNK  path to a new level that we don &apos;t remember how to it .
so i looked at three and smiled , but she &apos;s really serious .
wait , wait , here &apos;s my favorite project .
the shame is a person .
and then let &apos;s throw away from the  UNK  teaching to the best statistics .
i walked in the car , in my feeling feel very dark .
all the adults know all kinds of risks .
UNK  up , up .
somebody came up with a old version .
and then he looked at me .
that &apos;s frightening , feelings .
we were all of our colleagues around all over the world , colleges colleges , to help us to work , work and work as a information center in information to the  UNK  device around the world .
as you &apos;ve seen , not just simple to play the way to be a strong tool .
but a lot of times a lot of them were taught .
every single one gives you to 100,000 .
and so it &apos;s pushing you .
but then what happens is that all of these forms of all of these things , and they &apos;re exchanging information .
it &apos;s like  UNK  .
each generation will use the images that they have from the origin of their life as a standard , and it &apos;s going to be .
i &apos;m here to share with you my style .
but the ad is still realizing that they &apos;re not slow .
so what happens here ?
i had to have a long time in prison , after life and fish in a prison camp for suicide .
he died , brutally  UNK  .
i spent one time in an  UNK  with a teenager , and he took out of the bridge and said , &quot; oh , look .
you know , finally , we have to believe what we haven &apos;t seen .
these are very important activities , but they &apos;re going to steal them from energy .
now , who are ready ?
and not the professor of my boss ; he was contagious .
maybe i don &apos;t want to make a  UNK  .
you may be able to donate this on google , but it &apos;s disease , not in the middle of the room , and it can lead to the  UNK  .
before i end up , let me tell you about my grandmother .
we have some good things from the vertical axis here , the number of whales  UNK  across the country , the supply supply .
there are lots of fish .
how do you feel like if you live in a world where you &apos;ve eaten spinach , especially when it &apos;s an  UNK  .
UNK  khan : what does that mean ?
the picture is a bit .
and the nurse was thinking at the time and said , &quot; oh , i think she &apos;s going to be fine . &quot;
so for example , we &apos;re going to spend a million dollars per month for five years in the next five years , yes , a million dollars .
10 times three times .
and the staff of the emergency room .
so now , evolution can happen in a couple of seconds .
i still don &apos;t know what you think about me , but i could get it .
in the other world , i was in all these  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , violence and addiction .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
we can &apos;t do that without the government , we need to measure it more efficiently .
the  UNK  academy and the  UNK  .
and i think that all of us here are part of the next generation -- that &apos;s what it is .
but we &apos;re taking a very complicated thing , turning it into hours , one of the species , and shaped the brain that might be thinking .
that &apos;s what happens .
i have a complicated idea , messy , and ambiguity in mind .
this is the sheer terror of a nine , who was convicted .
now , when you heard someone stared at the mistake , then the mistake ?
i went to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral dissonance on this life is very long , but it &apos;s a public space .
crime in the united states has decreased a lot of the last three decades .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m an  UNK  fan of concrete .
and if you &apos;re asking questions about other things , they &apos;re also on friday nights .
but you know what ?
i went there , in boston ,  UNK   UNK  in west africa .
two times in an emergency room , i wasn &apos;t going to be  UNK  .
good , good .
so you don &apos;t lose their animals with animals .
if necessary , the services of government can help them connect , but a neighbor is a better solution and save more than the services of government .
i have a question for all of you here : when there are important things that are going to be our hands , all of us , we &apos;re a crowd , like we &apos;re going to be a team ?
i believe we need to do more progress to help people become suicide victims , and they &apos;re not less .
they said , he never heard of the guy .
and i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel like that it &apos;s true . these two guys are drinking , keep going on . &quot;
and the next piece of the picture is about four women , three generations together in new life .
let me wrap up .
the neuron is the sensory apparatus that controls stem cells .
he said , &quot; she said to all the girls that they &apos;re special . &quot;
and this is starting with a  UNK  .
and she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to do with three three , three . &quot;
a lot of people have been around , about 60 percent when we give the 24  UNK  , and when it &apos;s six percent , it &apos;s 40 percent .
the child in me was fascinated by these abilities .
i went up and started treatment for her .
i &apos;m not sure -- it &apos;s not the same time .
a community community goes up to turn it from a ferrari that something that we can be part of that .
this is not the issue of privacy and security .
they were given to the other purposes -- the government , the opposition , and sometimes it &apos;s just for fun .
what do you do with that ?
it &apos;s a  UNK   UNK  , and it &apos;s dark .
did you know what people call a  UNK  ?
there &apos;s a time i come and listen to them after a few hours , three legs , and she said , &quot; well ,  UNK  , let me tell you about  UNK   UNK  .
the key thing is that the underside of the sea is towed on the boat back then .
if i was a pretentious , i could put it into a kind of  UNK  , and then it it into this room .
but this picture is so much imagination that this transformation is happening .
every time you think about grandma , i know she thinks that all our grandchildren are special .
i don &apos;t know the whole of all of these engines .
all right .
it &apos;s like .
i had a couple of lectures in germany .
and we wanted to start to this machine around the world .
so after four years , a  UNK   UNK  in a row , an  UNK  boat .
&quot;  UNK  , &quot; rebecca saxe is one of the most popular video games .
so it &apos;s the open project .
and i  UNK   UNK  --  UNK  and showed him .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t  UNK  in the law .
but if i could give it , and i see me , i &apos;m going to
they allow us to build something larger than ourselves , our buildings , every single brick .
i had a 14 year-old kid , the black woman and poor .
for me , it means that time to think about , to talk about the poor , people have a difficult condition , for those who don &apos;t have to come to ted .
perhaps the smallest of the 21st and apps in the last few years .
and when it &apos;s about this , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i hope you know the answer to you .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , the bacteria can actually make dna .
and after about nine days , they left three -- three  UNK  , the wife , and her grandmother .
the surprising thing is that the way that we could have a lot of complexity , because it evolves from a billion years ago .
but we still don &apos;t really understand the choice .
and i really think that the most important is that we have no longer a choreographer .
it &apos;s trying to confront the analogy and emergence of justice .
i have here 100 , white flour , which i tend to try to try to protect staff in the airport .
and she made me so much that i could barely breathe , and then she left me .
i &apos;ve been a book since i was 16 years old .
it &apos;s a group of citizens who wrote a long list report on the page for answering the proposal of the financial reforms .
when i said to my  UNK  , she looked at me and said , um , um .
well ,  UNK  , the judge is authority .
and that creates a social network around where you &apos;ve taken .
he didn &apos;t think about something else . you start with animal control .
now , it &apos;s hard to tell you how animations are made .
the only challenge is three to 10 .
&quot; because , from the morning , she said , &quot; he said .
during the year , we hadn &apos;t a single time .
we like to improve .
and it allows us to produce more sophisticated products with design .
and he looked at me , &quot; oh , you know , you don &apos;t don &apos;t worry too much about the talk , and you speak . &quot;
every time you do , you have to name it , and he named the first is al al .
UNK   UNK  , a great honor of  UNK  , talked about this .
a special particular way that i &apos;ve been doing is still evolving .
in a world , i &apos;m an opponent of an opponent .
the phone , the computer ,  UNK  , the cds and many other things that we &apos;ve created in society to work with information .
the lights , the sound , the solar cell , the engine -- everything is accessible .
they sold these tools for the government for the  UNK  .
it &apos;s  UNK  with my passion passion , but there &apos;s a little difference , because using a camera , a process of planning .
this is an example of the project that they &apos;ve done , the shooter vending machine pressure .
the next morning , i woke up and i thought , i had a dream of crazy crazy , or did i write it ?
in fact , i don &apos;t have written it , but i gave it to the supreme court .
he came here in the  UNK  , as you know .
i was living in alabama , as well as the other states would actually lowered your vote , if you were  UNK  .
and let me end with my three words : i have remembered .
so i went through my gut .
it was a long time in the gulf of the  UNK  bay .
terrorism -- this is starting by the end of the reform and adventure for the world war ii .
they &apos;re getting worse , because we are  UNK  .
and sometimes you go to ted talk to it , and you tell you that if you don &apos;t come to you .
mothers are three .
how do we handle it ? &quot;
because the picture is working on with you .
is it a little bit about or something about color ?
for those people who want to choose their own financial supplies , not about 300 or less .
but they didn &apos;t know what happened to it as a loss .
but what happens to another  UNK   UNK  .
and here you &apos;ll see , same with the  UNK  , the sheet and the water ,  UNK   UNK  .
and oil droplet as if they started out and divide .
and you can &apos;t just do this kind of technique like this , but it &apos;s also a little solution . &quot;
and my doctors will also turn these data , so that you can see these problems associated with my weight , not only at the time that i needed to support anything or something like that , but for that time .
today , we &apos;re doing it with a  UNK  and machine .
and my colleagues is working on , and when you get rid of the  UNK  on the right , he calls the surgeons .
she went back and to death .
surely , we can handle the fire hydrant , and many people did .
michael pollan  UNK  from the science fiction is one of the first few people watching this video on twitter .
skysurfing is  UNK  with different functions .
and in the three days three days later , it &apos;s clear that she &apos;s never  UNK  .
the same time that i want to look at is the period of life on earth .
i studied medicine in the classroom that starts to start and activity of the neck bulls , every single roof of the artery artery artery from the artery , but the complexity , the rare and the .
now , my mistake is that it &apos;s not to be especially when you do in a hospital that when i was 14 with a patient .
when you &apos;re preaching , where someone else is , someone might be your spouse or somebody else , you can find the  UNK  device .
now , this view of this idea is constantly drifting in our thinking that they &apos;re very important .
it was devastating , and it doesn &apos;t make any choice .
first : cuts
imagine the first piece : a man took a whole career .
and every time it goes out , they &apos;re not separate chemicals in them .
this is a graph that shows that video game became the last summer .
these  UNK   UNK  , and tell the story .
and i graduated from school at the impression is that if i remember all , and the more you could , all the more you know , the more you know , &apos; i &apos;m going to be the wrong with the wrong problem .
they use their hands for writing applications to help better work better .
and fortunately , you &apos;re not dead .
but i think there &apos;s something that &apos;s flashing on us .
we decided to do a little experiment , and we got the press for the experiment .
and during the process , i collected more of knowledge .
and so this approach works well for anything that we made in creativity .
and it &apos;s a map of open .
nature i found myself at the digital technology .
like here , we have  UNK   UNK  from zimbabwe , ukraine .
and he drank , and he took a beer beer , and gave me a beer for me .
today , i &apos;d like to talk about one of the biggest problems of our choice is the problem with options .
my second message was worse .
and this  UNK   UNK  will try to have a petition to try and to make the sense of the laws of law .
for those who lose their faith in government , this is when we ask ourselves about a world that we want to leave .
let &apos;s talk about al .
in this country , i  UNK  people who were rejected by the medical treatments .
see , how many times we &apos;re leading to a political leadership -- and we spend spend a lot of energy to go to find a political leadership -- and then we sit back and hope to reflect the values and our needs , but can &apos;t you change ?
because the dark zones are as if we &apos;re actually evolving to the past .
and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
and so you have to create hours and go back and reading the rest of the book .
what they need is a medical culture .
it &apos;s a guy in the office of the city of the city of the city , knowing that he can use it , not for the snow , but to lead to the tsunami of the tsunami .
they can give their opinions on the vehicles and they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re doing it .
in the plans of funding funded the current level of reducing the growth .
and despite that , it &apos;s the gravitational level .
so , out of the back of this day , you have to go out , and , in a chapter ,  UNK  a  UNK  and it &apos;s a name .
i think we &apos;re going to be too aggressive if we are the ultimate  UNK  of evolution .
the illiteracy is in the united states , it &apos;s actually violence .
i started thinking , how do this story happen ?
it &apos;s a small application that you can locate  UNK  .
oh , why ?
and &quot; she &apos;s his answer .
and in this case , a neighbor that saw .
and therefore , i think this picture of what it means that if you look at it with a few billion years .
so the lego took off the concrete , the blocks of the world , and made it into the bricks of imagination .
the kind of terror doesn &apos;t care , i don &apos;t talk about is a bug for you .
for example , in particular cases , we can actually develop a program by starting with  UNK  .
we have to invest in post-conflict government .
everybody &apos;s  UNK  in the  UNK  .
in the &apos; 70s -- , oh no , starting from the &apos; 60s -- europe -- a lot of projects .
if you don &apos;t do it , others can adjust it .
in fact , the different types of different ways in the way they make their ability to communicate better with the chemicals , they &apos;re faster , more relaxing , more  UNK  and more .
storytelling is becoming  UNK  .
i think that , when you kill someone , you &apos;re not a lesbian .
and i see that combination of these photographs also have a process .
it &apos;s not stopping and stress .
i &apos;m not  UNK  phone and work , and i should have to do , is to call charlie , and give you to give you an opportunity to meet directly .
and so -- it says , &quot; this book is &quot; -- and so i built my name .
she was used to go to a lot of times , and she walked with her two friends who were  UNK   UNK  , who was  UNK   UNK  on the bus at the  UNK  botanical  UNK  and  UNK   UNK  , a white woman whose husband was  UNK   UNK  , who was called  UNK  .
and it &apos;s almost like a reaction in the course , as the antibody started to attack .
so i felt like our mobile phones , our  UNK  clock and our camera .
in the next few weeks , i was writing myself and my first experience , i was not in our lives in our own culture -- in this culture , i felt lonely , paralyzed , not feeling helpless as adults , because i couldn &apos;t tell me to my colleagues .
and surely , we can find a series of fast food .
&quot; in germany where there &apos;s no staff .
the idea of firefly fireflies in the glass , you know , why is very interesting to me .
and oil was not the support of the husband , she  UNK  when he came back and from the  UNK  , and he was a little bit more .
by measuring the  UNK  cost of 30 and 20 percent , and the more you &apos;re willing to save weight gain emissions .
i mean , it &apos;s incredible .
and my mother still takes time and english .
when we make a right now we can talk about everything around the world around us that what they don &apos;t believe really meaningful .
and during this phase , we &apos;ve got a phase transition .
it also has a application , a website and a device on the phone , called  UNK   UNK  .
what they need is an environment for them .
and then i went there , and i &apos;ll just listen .
i &apos;m not supposed to be asking .
a few months , i didn &apos;t forget him .
so we &apos;re closed .
they have over 75 different types of different  UNK  , including these  UNK  , because they made from trees .
we use these techniques and we start with them to make sense of the patients in patients .
he was dying because of the  UNK  .
and i was shocked , and i fell down .
i said , &quot;
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
they noticed that the city was never  UNK  .
and i was taken out from the pieces of metals , and i couldn &apos;t fit together .
we see this , but we don &apos;t want you to talk about the problem .
well , if you take an example , something that doesn &apos;t belong to their own language , they &apos;re not just a choreographer .
he just wanted to see people .
there was a patient who i thought was broken .
within a year , you do a survey survey .
digital  UNK  :  UNK
he walked into the room and the next door , i was very close to a lawyer .
today there is a big community community who helped build the tools that we need to work together .
&quot; it &apos;s her granddaughter daughter , and i promise you &apos;re always going to take care . &quot;
and the truth is that these preemptive are becoming worse .
i &apos;m an academic student .
and what happens is that you &apos;re going to create a collection of you that you can put on the web .
in the last 20 years i wrote and talked about medical medicine , i &apos;ve been studying the research and the in the medical training to learn that , maybe one of the first experiments i wrote to the toronto of my hometown &apos; &quot; harry potter , &quot; art . &quot;
so the developer developed that means that the force is to sustain the countries that countries have  UNK  their troops to their  UNK  .
this is happening faster , and that &apos;s why i find it pretty ambiguous .
to do that , i &apos;m going to talk about something that &apos;s actually not related to technology and computers .
who &apos;s in in the same business school , but medical science is special even more because we met the old gift .
so what happens here ?
well , this is interesting . this is the approach of the real life .
i think the arts arts and films might be able , and the simulation .
and the most exciting part of them is that they &apos;re separate together .
instead of taking me to the third world , we gave them the  UNK  of the city .
you &apos;ve seen a little example of view of evolution when we &apos;ve evolved on evolution on the front page .
and then i ended up out of the car , money into the supreme court .
and are we believe in a single way in the future of the future , a government that we could have in the next 50 years ?
and i thought , &quot; well , you &apos;re going to do . &quot;
they &apos;re still very well .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m good , i was born , enthusiastic .
and when i walked on the back of the supreme court , a young man in the older man .
about tectonic plates .
i was eight in a hotel room in a basement room in a moment where she was 600 miles away , in melbourne .
suppose you &apos;re  UNK  , and you &apos;re led to an  UNK  surgeon , which is 400 .
but our lives are much more than what we proceed in a memory .
so i should ask them .
try to end up children with children who are not born .
it &apos;s a sunrise .
now there is a project in the european law system that spends $ two billion dollars , which is still working .
and then the introduction with the doctor doctor .
and we wanted to be able to connect with this .
although i was able to communicate with life .
now you don &apos;t have to buy the bottle caps , but it &apos;s better for us to be better for our lifetimes , for example , we &apos;ve shown that the problem problems in our daily decisions .
but somehow , we  UNK  ourselves out of this problem .
these companies could be hosting returns or services like mobile phones , just to make sure that the  UNK  devices are sent to there .
the red line , dark , dark matter , i got a little jellyfish .
that &apos;s where the government system and the election .
now we see the opposite effect .
i &apos;m going to focus on a number that i hope many of you &apos;ve heard me .
and we lost our control over the surface of the punishment .
and two days later , i went to the next to the emergency room , and that was my father asked to talk to her to her in her room .
when i say , authenticity , i mean , is authenticity .
we &apos;re trying to help people convicted .
in the same year , at the center of the next to the next revolution , the next generation of the bricks .
and what we found is that there is a correlation .
now in the financial world , i think one of the best examples of how good one is the david , which is that david  UNK  is  UNK  .
in our country , in the united states states , you still have been dumped , you &apos;re likely to be  UNK  than 11 times , as victims as victims as a black woman , who met the amputee of the people who were gestated their hosts .
it &apos;s not  UNK  .
and it creates these cells -- these cells have been a billion years ago .
in both cases , patients are surgeons and fine .
and it &apos;s 46 percent of  UNK  .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m asking you to think about , because everything is changing .
it connects them together .
i used to be interested in this shop , but naturally , i used to ask myself how to come and not ?
it &apos;s not the problem .
if you keep the knot , for all of these things , that means you have too much more choices , which means you .
this is a  UNK  arrangement .
by talking about the environment , i think a huge problem in the last 10 years is that they have been buried in the room , put on the screen on the computer screen .
that &apos;s happening . we all can feel it .
they go from their options , they &apos;re stuck there .
and you think you &apos;re going to leave the  UNK  , but you can &apos;t .
this is going to talk to you if you call your  UNK  from your city .
you can go to the web , download the blueprints and from them .
after three months of the refugee camps , we landed in melbourne .
and if i say , &quot; skin , you &apos;re going to attack &quot; attacks , &quot; and if i said , &quot; yeah , she &apos;ll let me alone .
and it &apos;s just another mistake of others . it &apos;s not a noun , and that &apos;s support , for the people that can be better .
he rides his group up to the  UNK  .
so before i actually start the importance of the presentations , let &apos;s start with baseball .
i think , as strengthening of that changed the world .
i got a little bit .
&quot; oh , she goes back , &quot;
fifteen ft , the streets of the police were  UNK  by the protesters .
we &apos;re having a system that &apos;s going to be willing to treat you so much better if you &apos;re wealthy wealth than the poor poor .
if you could be higher than it , because i have a piece of paper here .
hold them all the other .
and this is also one of the three main main on the internet .
i studied in my little  UNK  in my ph.d in beijing , in the  UNK  diego in toronto , not far away .
a young man in london is a  UNK  , and he said , &quot; oh , today .
something is wrong .
so the first principle is that combination of images should have a  UNK  .
when i started this program , i don &apos;t know the idea of government .
you &apos;re actually an inspiring .
so he allowed people to test these .
here &apos;s an example .
he goes to go back .
because that &apos;s where the actual work is happening .
who is the  UNK  ?
and the next process , like crazy , it seems like a few decades .
and then again , again , give it another generation .
by the way , with these things i &apos;m just telling you to be your own fate , let &apos;s go ahead .
now there are a lot of people involved in authority .
when they face their problems , they may not be interested in their own use .
this is the description of the human .
and because that idea can be explained to a minute , and i &apos;ll tell you three stories to go on time .
in this material is the notes from a company in germany where you give the egyptian government , a lot of tools tools to be able to hear on a massive scale of all sorts of communication and communication .
she was always the old man in the family .
and here , the parts are made fine .
in the big cities in this country , los angeles , baltimore , washington , washington , to go to 50 -- 60 percent of the people are in the same condition .
and so , we didn &apos;t know what that means .
and therefore , we have the most vulnerable to be  UNK  .
and what i learned is that the error is everywhere .
now i &apos;m going to show you more .
this is the information center and communication .
and if you think this is kind of weird , you should know that there &apos;s a three-dimensional version of three million dollars .
you see the  UNK  of a thermostat , like this , and now you &apos;ve got the lights .
everything isn &apos;t going to change fast as they &apos;re going on .
this is a report page that we &apos;re working on comparing the power of the processor for the power of the power .
but what &apos;s even more important is that it shows that new generation to solve the problem of government -- not the problem of a rigid system , but of the collective actions .
the roofs are quickly becoming the most abundant material in the world .
people always feel when i said , &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
do you know how much life is one ?
we &apos;re wiggling them .
my view of photography photography , when i had a video camera at 15 15 .
yves !
and in a half of flies , two hours later , she started getting harder .
we gave the children for children and see them playing with  UNK  .
instead of telling you money , what can we help ?
we &apos;re moving forward , we &apos;re going to move to a world where the power of dark is far closer to technology and technology and technology can move closer together .
the apple does that .
but it &apos;s also an example of government as a system .
we asked around and nobody knows .
and some of you know that i have 10,000 people watching twitter .
the next thing we found in the case that people like to buy a bottle of bottles .
and then , i even put home on the top of the island to make it in the  UNK  .
so we start to rely on computers to make a difference in design .
and she said , &quot; what are you going to do ? &quot;
they want to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t go into my  UNK  . &quot;
my mother had gone , but we told each other day in the day and i heard her back home .
and yes , the mother of this is just sitting here in the fourth grade year .
one of the things we &apos;ve done at the university of  UNK  is a  UNK  .
now i planned the computer to make money , and i know that the device i use to design the computer that could not be treated with the recent technologies in the computer industry .
i grew up in a house , an american family and  UNK  and my grandmother was a family .
and this is something that we talk about the curve curve .
and so , we have three of violence against people who are being treated by a bicycle or an  UNK  level , rather than they asked them for their assets .
it &apos;s surprising and funny , casey  UNK  an s.o.s. and his idea for five million views .
innovation , creativity , creativity , developed that not only from our ideas .
and even though i don &apos;t stand up in front of me , but i can still see the people i was walking back .
this is the olive oil .
this is speeding exponentially , there &apos;s a  UNK  , and the nature .
there &apos;s always a starting with a sketch , an idea .
and that &apos;s the first time that i knew about that .
and what &apos;s interesting is that this report page , like a lot of ted talks about what technology is familiar with us , is a kind of  UNK  on a  UNK  curve .
about race and questions about whether we &apos;re willing to kill them .
i didn &apos;t apply the same time anymore .
so the western governments are giving the government accountable to their bidding .
it was very busy , i was asked .
i don &apos;t even put the engine that i don &apos;t know anything about anything about attachment to the interior , and to help me how to make a choice .
thank you .
one of the two things will happen .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even even though they &apos;re living in society , because they don &apos;t trust what they exist .
we don &apos;t want to talk about history .
i asked to be an opponent . when i was an average normality , my colleagues was working on the bottom of the pain and was  UNK  .
&quot; she thought you could do anything that i wanted . &quot;
well , it &apos;s not fine .
not in a science -- she puts a coffee cup or a little slab of a cup and asked her patients and family and family , and then , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ?
personally , i don &apos;t accept this , that the founders were built in modern art , so i decided to change it .
and so i jumped on , to jump into this technology , to see how i could use it to produce how to explain how to explain how to explain how to make it ?
right now , at the top , there &apos;s a 98 percent of men who are  UNK  .
it &apos;s hard .
i &apos;d like to tell you why many more medical projects are failing .
i remember vividly every day .
and a story that reflects the new issues as environmental problems .
the question is , why do they accept this ?
and in fact , if i know and i knew that my colleagues knew that i was a  UNK  of my orthopedic thesis in the hospital , in my hospital , believed me , i &apos;m going to be hard to look at the  UNK  .
like many people , i thought the basic government is just to get people to vote .
we talked to  UNK  , there &apos;s nothing changed from ancient metropolis .
today , that number two million million .
think about a tough choice : buying a car .
because all of this technology emerges from itself .
i &apos;m showing in a petition that that there was a false  UNK  , the  UNK  of the police and the bloodshed .
they have 250 birds and  UNK  different types of fruits and vegetables and different types of different types of twigs , and more than two different types of different species , and that &apos;s time that we actually usually drank .
now i was able to go outside of the safety of our hearts enough to know that , well , the world could collapse , but without fear .
in fact , the existence of these programs depend on the work .
UNK  is an  UNK  company that came from holland -- or at least they were also .
and over 10,000 years of the dutch are already found and sent back .
read it ?
so he made the job that the computer programmer would do is write an app .
and that theory seemed to be given at once until i met her  UNK  .
we have a search for tooling and the sponsors .
and the company that i was trying to go into the environment by my attention ...
a few years ago , i started a program searching for technology and creating them for a year and work in the environment , they seem to hate it ; they had to work for government .
they &apos;re arguing that it &apos;s been shown in the early way that before they don &apos;t want to be presented .
i &apos;m just talking about a human system to help each other .
and one of the things that we made me share with you a little movie .
27 years later when i returned , the size of these fish are only half .
but when this happens , everything changes .
and so what i &apos;m going to ask , what i &apos;m still asking , what is the state of the world ?
it &apos;s like the  UNK  column , which allows you to build larger pieces and more complicated , step-by-step brick .
when i was a kid , i had a whole raft of the  UNK  , rock and wolves .
now the question i want to make is , if you look at the edges of the equation , they don &apos;t get up forever .
at one time , your screen is .
set up a structure that &apos;s an interesting thing .
in 1972 , there were beaten people from prison .
and you &apos;re going to see that the problem when it comes down to the list of all the financial .
but a member called  UNK   UNK  , attention to another thing , which is that people still still walk in front of those things .
a rat , what &apos;s a  UNK  rat ? try and check it ? yes .
and that &apos;s closer to the broader level , is what we want to do now .
if it &apos;s true , it means that we are in the middle of the insurgency .
so if you do the system , as i was taught , and remove all the donor employees , it &apos;s not going to rest .
he &apos;s &quot;  UNK  &quot;  UNK  &quot; the &quot;  UNK  &quot; data . &quot;
this story wasn &apos;t .
so if you look at the level of the challenges plans to cultivate two of the financial assets in the 1970s .
if the government says the documents , but they don &apos;t have to be truthful , but they &apos;re going to
and this boat , it &apos;s pretty bad , called  UNK  .
it &apos;s trying to do something about death .
they &apos;ve been designed to become light ,  UNK  , sensors and sensors .
so a living organism , for example , we don &apos;t want to eat something like this , because it &apos;s not flashy , and they feel uncomfortable .
i &apos;m going to do this .
and i  UNK  everything .
&quot; she thinks it &apos;s a kid .
i think the philosophy of our real stuff , it doesn &apos;t help anybody .
and the other half of the client is , walking from the lower option , four engines , and then i added the healthier options .
how could attack attack attacked ?
it shows how the government can be more effective -- not like the private companies , like many people think .
let &apos;s tell them that we have to grow up with that .
this is a conference where there are people in the future , and people can recognize the future that &apos;s around the year 2000 .
and in one day , you have a pore between the cloud and the  UNK  , and i wondered , probably i can feel pretty much better again .
but this is like this : what happens in the street path .
the second story is still  UNK  for a different notion that &apos;s called the  UNK  movement .
this is the simulation of the gulf .
and here &apos;s what we did , we &apos;ve been using a crowd solution at the netherlands .
well , it &apos;s a saturday day , right .
this is an animation diagram .
and i went back to work .
somebody can think that this is just a picture of the landscape and the bottom is  UNK  .
jimmy  UNK  this is based on twitter to get this video game now .
it &apos;s just done .
at the time , when we ate out of us , we want to go into a  UNK  and room in the sky .
and i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re not going to drink a beer . &quot;
and so it gives us a big question .
this program is called the american program , and this program is rather like a  UNK  for the computer .
but there &apos;s a big difference : the transistor is only for professionals .
when i want to make the fear , one simple example i did .
it &apos;s not that .
but another thing .
three brothers were not visible .
and we think this is one of the main problems that &apos;s why not all -- but most of the medical projects have failed , since we don &apos;t even listen to anymore .
however , let &apos;s think about them in a way of sync with our lives .
this is an example of how our government is using technology to fight us , the citizens of the country .
three levels of a character that you will always want to be near .
there was a survey that was done with the ceos that we followed by the ceos .
and i sat in the train  UNK  , because after three  UNK  , she was put into the special care , and i hope was about three .
so we have an opportunity to change the situation .
UNK  ,  UNK  !
he said , &quot; you do , you have to be able to write this crazy crazy ? &quot;
well , it &apos;s actually  UNK  .
every single one in every generation is just a few seconds .
thank you .
and i think about this .
i began to find a little bit more .
the shore is somewhere else .
so why am i worry ?
so i want to make a difference , something that happens when you go .
scott  UNK  .
and that &apos;s an amazing experience .
oxfam ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
and the lunch is approaching me , and i think i &apos;m going to stop here , before i &apos;ve been given by the way .
and in fact , sometimes they do , but we didn &apos;t even know it .
the answer is , if i take it on a normal curve , you can say , is the year , and no matter what this is what technology is i &apos;m trying to understand , the graph is really crazy .
and similarly , like &quot;  UNK   UNK  , it seems to appear to nothing .
let me tell you about some pieces .
because after all , we all depend on individuals on this planet .
for example , you can see in the direction .
but the applications like to remind us that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just the government of government , contributing taxes and receive the services .
they listen to the line of your internet .
and the three men who were black men at the age of 18 , 30 , 30 , or  UNK  .
and that &apos;s what i saw .
UNK  .
he actually had a lot of video games .
because i &apos;m often trying to explain to people understand how new technologies are going to be great , and i think that , because i &apos;ve been here in some of you here , i &apos;m going to show you to think about your thinking and try to understand what &apos;s going on and to try and figure out what &apos;s going on .
but what &apos;s important is that creativity is creative in this culture culture .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t be .
and i think there are  UNK  that are going to explain how to start with it , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simple story about it , and at that time , there are tiny little spots floating around it .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
i &apos;m going to talk about a little idea .
and we have this idea that if we drop the characteristics of the  UNK  out of medicine , which is simply a safe system .
and when i walked into the room , we looked at me .
and this is  UNK  . &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
privacy is supposed to be sure .
and these people know that we didn &apos;t have to focus on it .
if people were coming back to the first two billion years , the earth was like this , with a huge amount of chemicals .
then 800,000 decided to use this software to get people to the  UNK  .
my dad felt her hands .
in fact , i didn &apos;t learn this when i was a lawyer or a lot of work .
but these kinds of them are not immunized , they &apos;re damaged , because they died .
i was in at an  UNK  hospital in this toronto when she was  UNK  into the emergency room of the hospital where i worked .
so by combining the color , that &apos;s the light and light in the interactions between these images , the  UNK  of the medina , the color and the dust , we make the difference between the different image and make it as a single piece of  UNK  that might be included in the middle class .
and i think that the chances are always around us .
we need to find ways to confront the challenges , but the problems and the status quo .
my second video games came out of  UNK  for a bicycle in the bike lane , but normally there are no options that you don &apos;t go to the bike lanes .
so in fact , i &apos;m going to go in and started  UNK  , an application of interactive equipment for the ipad .
because it doesn &apos;t look like it .
so to get a real outcome , i think it comes to work .
with  UNK  information , the same amount of choice .
and i went through the  UNK  time from my own self , and felt frustrated , and i was doing it again , again , again .
we &apos;re at the time of chaos .
this is my first sketch .
the pictures where you &apos;re going to spend a little bit of time to think about a secret .
it &apos;s because of the government as a fragile ocean and politics is just a thick layer of six feet on the surface .
and for that process , when i was a graduate student at the end of the last year , i was elected .
a young woman is said , &quot; today i am . &quot;
so how does this happen ?
i feel like anyone could do that .
any of you could become famous famous for seven weeks .
one thing called &quot; jazz &quot; what is called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
in a world where the video is more than two hours on saturday minutes , just really unique and surprise to be able to notice the way that these things .
and so they brought them back to the book of modern art .
a huge scale of this is going to take this fish for the 1980s .
and so when i saw the ipad , i saw it was a storytelling that storytelling was able to connect the world around the world .
now , i don &apos;t remember the sea , i got a lot of times , but to swim away from the  UNK  of the men on the boat , or when the ships were dying and not just released for six hours .
three months later i went to the site and move forward .
this is a  UNK  seal .
that means the lack of control , always and the new things .
they put it to adulthood at the size of the  UNK  .
and the scientists led to all these different tasks that those ceos that join them , and they spent a lot of time to do these decisions .
on my television shows , &quot; the  UNK   UNK  , &quot; i built the word poetry , &quot; which is my worst mistake , i said , &quot; oh my gosh , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah
and if you look at the picture , the results can be great , and it &apos;s quite real .
more than one decade in the past , we &apos;ve seen three negative consequences , until they give people a choice .
and if you think the on the left is to be , and on the right is to you .
well , there are always a lot of opportunities around us .
my mother was  UNK  .
it &apos;s a fight against drugs .
well , if you live in a remote remote region , and you have a family who has been  UNK  by the coronary arteries and the family fell into a cardiologist , which is the  UNK  coronary artery .
this is my computer . it &apos;s a very simple device .
they have over 700,000 different legends .
the purpose of this is to be able to know the origins of those documents .
&quot; no can &apos;t be written by false positives .
now i also want to have children , and i wonder about the boat .
so i wanted to make three basic principles of the week in order to achieve a result .
why do we have to apply the technology we want ?
my shoulders was born in the last five years .
he described one of them . &quot;
yes . we have , we have autonomy .
in fact , every living organism is shaped by its genome , and the code code .
for example , we have the designers that don &apos;t have to know anything about video games with a creative tool .
and in fact , they are pollen in their populations and the special structure that are responsible for reading , read , information .
not only , you have to register a piece of material that &apos;s extracted from the needle machine .
now you can do all of those random notes , run all the program , and they picked the most compelling programs that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
and in fact , most of these tiny little dots in the grains of  UNK  , or  UNK  .
and it seems like this new technology is supposed to create magic , not to kill it .
good , there are some people .
and she said , &quot; what &apos;s three things that i promise you could never have a snack . &quot;
why do i don &apos;t ask the boss ? why are the patient home ?
we can make them doing things that they don &apos;t think they do .
i couldn &apos;t fit .
&quot; that &apos;s going to hurt you , and tired . &quot;
at the time that happens when these communities collide together , in fact , they together form a form of serving them to the entire nucleus on a whole form of dna .
and she &apos;s this idea of winter , i know i had to spend a few months to prepare , to find different places for the parts of the photo .
but this is not registered by the paper .
and so in the perspective , it &apos;s approaching us .
do you want to hear ? &quot;
we are mutants , and we &apos;re almost like we can &apos;t understand where we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re going to go to the budget , we &apos;re going to go into the world .
the determination of  UNK  from one and a  UNK  said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go through the cycle . &quot;
we all want to be the infamous stars , singers , comedian , and secondly , that seems to be very hard to do .
from criminals .
it &apos;s spread .
and gary said that he was willing to help people in this morning a day , to take the free to the world &apos;s best way to the world .
there is a mismatch between technology and design that allow us how to be when we &apos;re actually paying attention to poverty , not for the status quo , and not to injustice .
oh my god !
we told me three and help with her , and we were always on her .
i decided to go to the united states .
and we are at the same time as well as possible as well as possible as living as well as living as possible .
the earliest memory i remember is from the boat -- the engine of the boat , the money that the boat went into the river , the  UNK  .
and she didn &apos;t have spoken word poetry and she  UNK  .
we &apos;re using these programs to create a faster faster so that we can do cheaper faster .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about what i don &apos;t know .
and that &apos;s basically what i want to talk about .
and that actually raises my life for a lot .
what is the secret to make it look like ?
so i was playing with me as well as being true , stand at the moment .
because , maybe , this is photography , you can &apos;t wear the camera .
it gets closer to this  UNK  , and now you &apos;ve created apple forms .
the main reason is because we can look at the big wall of the spectrum , the  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , unbearable , we can &apos;t make the problem of the books and the courage and gratitude .
the transformation process is , it &apos;s faster , it &apos;s faster .
and that shows that the more ill-defined , the more you become an effective tool to help people save more .
and some of the oil spill have a special combination of chemical chemicals in the components that makes them link along with chemical chemicals and make the big oil .
&quot; come on , &quot; i said , &quot; and you don &apos;t have to be another . &quot;
they &apos;re creative inspiration .
it &apos;s a system where there are two places -- principled and the people who are not born , but doctors are not injured , and the people who have tenure .
let me show you one simple example .
we want to integrate every interactions in the world into the bricks .
so what you need to do is to be the green place is blue , and then you &apos;re going to be able to start to make bigger changes .
the first of the first cloned  UNK  were made in  UNK  with a very simple idea : the equivalent of  UNK  with the  UNK
and i came here , i was encouraged , and then listen to this , gave me a lot .
these applications can help us society .
another thing is that we know where all the gas stations .
that  UNK  for me to make the second technology in solving the problem of the choices that are very specific .
i was actually  UNK  meters , just like everybody .
we have these words with  UNK  .
turns out , he &apos;s not  UNK  .
but there are two problems with that .
now , it &apos;s not a bug that &apos;s the choices that any of us who have to give people when you look for them to make sense of their knowledge .
if you think about it , you &apos;ll see it as a great invention .
the next piece of view is a boat sitting next to the sea .
and i thought you should read it .
it &apos;s an expression .
he put it in silence .
but it has an incessant  UNK  .
and it seemed like , &quot; no one &apos;s going to be warm up on this .
i believe that for the people on the planet .
but that doesn &apos;t make sense of what we have something and we pay for our fight against us , and then we do ourselves .
my mother asked me , &quot; why did my mother tongue ? &quot;
occasionally , when i lose balance , i &apos;m going to end with that story .
and i &apos;d like to tell you that my worst mistake was only in the first sabbatical years as many of my colleagues said , math .
and of course she thinks that we need to be commitment .
and it &apos;s true to me , and i &apos;m very nervous and you can see .
today , we also do the same with the airplane .
in other words , they form , under the form of evolution , not an idea that allowed them to reflect how they do , to be able to copy them .
transistors is an electronic electronics that &apos;s going to take us from the world of  UNK  bricks together in the world that everything is interactive .
and the momentum of the criminal criminal is very simple and understandable .
there they &apos;re going to write these great applications , working with their staff .
a few minutes later my mother called electricity .
we don &apos;t choose to even even when even go to even when the opposite of things that are good for us .
but , but , you know ?
you &apos;ve got a little bit , you know , you &apos;ve got a little bit .
one or two hours later , if i met her three , and she said , &quot;  UNK  , you still feel like me ? &quot;
so in those plans , we have a  UNK  plan to get from the volunteers from each other
is it a trick ?
al  UNK  is a firefighter in boston .
it &apos;s going to change it -- but it &apos;s changing the way that it affected or nature .
then this is combining separate pictures .
now this is now in the  UNK  of the  UNK  .
it knows how we feel it .
it &apos;s going to happen during the period of life can be living , during the time they form this special detailed information , which might be learned in evolution in a hundred years of individuals who die of food .
i went in the car and then went to court .
now , the median age of our teammates members , 28 , is that much more than any of them .
and that &apos;s when i was my first hypothesis , i gave three  UNK  .
and that &apos;s real .
and just a few years ago , the lego that were introduced at home .
all of us , or at least least we &apos;re using an app or another machine , and these services are especially in the countries like iran , where the companies are going to use the services that are more reliable than others , and they &apos;re also encoded by the fact that the government can &apos;t hear the information that they communicate .
we have to turn it into complexity .
but the main point is , we &apos;re still in the galapagos .
so what happens ?
and you don &apos;t make a social society by the people who they treated with the rich , the power , and the people are entitled by the way they treat the poor , who is to me .
but the numbers aren &apos;t .
they prefer the  UNK  choice when it comes to the best interests for themselves .
well , in fact , you &apos;ve got a lot of information on the first time , but second , but i &apos;m guessing that you feel that much harder in second .
where do you go ?
we &apos;re at the top of the world in the middle of the world that i existed in the world that exist .
as most people on the boat , my mother brought a small bottle .
and i said , &quot; well , computer , you can take 10 percent of the random number of random products .
but the cat are watching watching these videos .
right ?
in fact , he collected the fish .
you have to realize the challenges challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
it &apos;s important .
i don &apos;t know about the wine .
all right .
i &apos;m absolutely sorry about that , but i try to learn something that i could inspire others .
by any way that we don &apos;t understand , but they remembered learning how to go on .
and she said this lady : do you remember ?
if i go into a room -- like today , i didn &apos;t know what you would think about me .
thank you .
they had to be  UNK  in their last year , because their network system was destroyed .
and we found that the more pipelines was born , actually , less .
it could be working on fire hydrant ,  UNK  the freeway , to have a  UNK  rat .
i want to admit to you something .
now this is the first question of today , what are you ready to hear about the  UNK  problem ?
do you know that you have a nba player with the 300  UNK  in the big bang ?
we &apos;re taking .
let &apos;s start .
we &apos;re going to be -- we &apos;re going to get rid of that .
a couple of weeks ago , we gave them  UNK  to risd and gave them a designer that didn &apos;t have any experience with the beer , wood and paper -- and tell them , &quot; or something . &quot;
and my mission when the staff of the emergency room was to discover , was to be the next to the emergency room .
maybe i have the right answer .
but on  UNK   UNK  , everything was recorded , to be able to see .
there &apos;s a dark energy bonanza , an optimist , a drastic of  UNK  and  UNK  .
he &apos;s an illness that may be a dangerous risk of  UNK  .
ninety percent of the oil that we train  UNK  chocolates , and other creatures creatures in the sea .
and those are the neural structures .
and so here , each of the book and all the world becomes a little  UNK  that i put on inside this piece of the device .
just share their experience with others .
the question about death is something interesting .
finally , you want to maintain the other things .
every time , she was going to call her , and she said , &quot; hey ,  UNK  , to the town , and we &apos;re going to go to .
and they will shine off the rest of the book .
it &apos;s just like this .
because i believe that the key to choose the best choice from the choice is to make choices
and then the family family together .
if you know anything about the technology of the state , you know that this happens .
in a hospital system where the medical vaccine costs two or three years .
maybe it &apos;s an hour to run the video .
and if you think about &quot; the &quot;  UNK  , &quot; if you think about how people have -- -- don &apos;t think about the story of what &apos;s going on .
you have to vaccinate your antibiotics and recover a few days .
all the good that i showed you today is designed to enable you to control your choices , and you can apply your own friends .
these  UNK   UNK  were slaughtered in the  UNK  room for thousands of years .
politics is not changing ; the government is .
i wrote this crazy thing .
i also believe that in many countries in this country , and of course a lot of places around the world , the silence of poverty are not rich .
in fact , the core is the essence of my belief that the only community .
one of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re going to go through a journey and you &apos;ve got to go out of the camera and the photos of the different objects .
we &apos;re taking our children and we &apos;re closer to the natural world and the magic and joy and joy that we have through a simple vehicle is a story .
&quot; do you remember patients with  UNK  ? &quot;
unlike the kind of entertainment entertainment of the 20th century , the community is how we become part of the phenomenon or what &apos;s going to do something about it .
underwater is towed in one of them .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not a nurse for three  UNK  , but that &apos;s another nurse , i said , three or three staff , i know .
well , we think that &apos;s simple .
in other words , i figured out what i wanted .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened to the  UNK  .
the servant , according to the notion , is the people who are down to beef , from being a single person , and that &apos;s not what to be wrong , but try to learn something from something that &apos;s just going to teach somebody else .
you know , the average the grocery store stores to give you a product .
if there is a resource in our family , our children pass through women .
in the next report , she said , &quot; i was walking in the region , there was a  UNK  in .
they had a six hours of her home , after my grandmother home , three and brothers and she calls her back to the emergency room and their wheelbarrow was just 50 .
so it really is how to make an idea more than a moment .
i talk a lot about these problems .
my grandfather was in solitary confinement , and i sold alcohol .
so the system is going to create an analogue to try to make false mistakes , human beings , not only create , a way to support , a  UNK  , supportive , but where people are tracking in the health care system can only be wrong , and especially people like me , when we make it wrong .
groups like in the last 12 months and have become a  UNK  in the game .
instead of having to code , to teach a circuit , which allows you to program with simple mathematical patterns .
they put three  UNK  .
and so my suggestion is , this is the only thing that i want to give you to the director of the e to make the two &quot;  UNK  &quot; with the backdrop of water .
in south africa , they knew that they couldn &apos;t mix with the  UNK  if they don &apos;t commit to the truth and to do .
in fact , you need a  UNK  , if you have a website that uses the  UNK   UNK  service , the kind of services that we &apos;re using .
as you can see here , these pictures are not special .
my task is not to leave her life through my life , and my lesson is to realize that , well , historically , we have been  UNK  .
go ahead and start .
and find the most compelling program with the numbers .
thank you .
and i would have been so long enough to get a little bit that i wasn &apos;t going to be able to do that .
and there &apos;s a night , and i was a kid , and i began to think that , if the judge can do if they have power power .
you give a one-page summary in the middle , and now you could come to me .
on the left , and the on the right is the  UNK  , but you know what &apos;s not .
what does this mean ?
i learned what was very simple when i was doing .
so i took a false papers , and the ambulance came home , my father &apos;s home home .
in other words , &quot; computer , you can give hundreds of millions of random  UNK  .
gee , you actually have to stand on the side of the people here .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest you today is four technological advances , but technology that we &apos;ve tested in a lot of ways that you can be easily in your business .
and then i was assigned to my job at  UNK  heart .
in fact , i made false papers .
now , the patient was injured , he said , and he said , and he &apos;s got a little bit of her nose into his breath , and suddenly she &apos;s affected threatening .
but i still kept working .
but in the middle of the nearest  UNK  to be able to help the patient ?
we opened up a little piece of christmas day to the store .
&quot;  UNK  cut &quot; is an animation that &apos;s written with music .
and i remember , at the time i was about eight , nine years old , it was a morning , i was teaching , into my living room , and i saw all the  UNK  around the room .
and they connect us into a larger community and faster than we have before .
and here &apos;s the problem .
and he talked to the patient family , and i was pretty sure that he was fine , and he would not be sued .
good . you &apos;re willing to get courage .
they seem to make the worse options worse , health .
this video has been 50 million views in this year .
now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read it , and i want you to clap if you &apos;re willing to express the suggestion .
but with these mobile technology , we can bring them all the way out , into the natural world .
they learn how to manage information , which is the cells of cell cells into a chemical chemical dna synthesizer .
but one of them , if you &apos;re lucky , it &apos;s going to put two .
now , it &apos;s almost an amusement park .
i want to talk about the issues and how to solve .
when this guy sees me , he came forward to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i &apos;m sitting here today , but i &apos;m going to make up in your head in your head , and a very different thinking and a little bit like my thinking .
that &apos;s the question we &apos;re going to have to worry about 50 years .
what you &apos;re looking for is that people come from the choices that are more expensive , and they &apos;re going on , and then again .
in the ability to sustain , the earth and technology , there &apos;s a lot of possibilities .
i always tried to explore them and show you how it works .
if you &apos;re not , when you ask , and if you answer , you &apos;re happy .
this is the main state of the company .
i told my mother was impossible .
there are bad guys .
they even use tools like  UNK   UNK  to discourage your computer , and then they can be able to get informed information , you have a conversation through your network , and you can be your password .
so i think it &apos;s pretty simple .
she said , &quot; well , let &apos;s not make you . &quot;
and the more we can understand more choices in our choices , we can be better in the art of choice .
we have preconceived notions of information , for example , i could actually be a psychiatric patient who suffered perfect .
everybody got the room because they were frustrated .
we don &apos;t know more about this .
but everything else would be , if the government could be able to attack on the supply chain supply .
for example , the printing press is a little bit of that way .
in the &apos; 80s in the late 1980s , if you owned a machine , you have to register it to the government .
that &apos;s what  UNK  did .
so at some point , a little piece of paint , and my granddad , you know , and the big piece of you are in , remember the gps spoofer .
when the &amp; amp ; amp ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ;
and i made out of  UNK  .
and this made me sad .
well , our view of all of our technology and technology , entertainment and creativity has to be  UNK  in sync with the view of the public health , compassion and justice .
&quot; the second thing that you want to promise that promise is always going to do the right thing .
now , think about your choices .
the chicago &apos;s software to allow people to have access to the surface .
and i &apos;ll never forget it .
if you &apos;re a pediatrician , you can do something good , but if you &apos;re a  UNK  , you can do something much better .
because that &apos;s the consequences we &apos;re starting to have a deep insight into what we are .
and those choices make the amount of choice that they make decisions .
i &apos;m just showing it the puzzle of the reality that you can take all of the different parts of the reality and aluminum them to make an example .
and that &apos;s the coral reef that became the  UNK  of our forests .
but in fact , none of any of the business surgery or a good surgeon or a cat .
and i think what we see is that , if you &apos;re a teacher , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re a rich rich , you know , you tell you , your words special meaning .
a few years ago i started growing up .
and the next stage , like the optic nerve and brain , a few hundred million years .
and so the next project is about a billion years ago .
my mother had a computer store and then  UNK  a choreographer and courage and a different business .
we know exactly the machines in the  UNK  city .
the united states has now the highest highest in the world .
eating oliver in the u.s.
recently , i had a survey for over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the americans would have been about 70 times in a day .
i am a new concept .
so the colony began to evolve the interesting level that evolution occur is not on a cell , but in a single one that we call life .
i have a new generation of new programs that produced by the combination of programs that make a better job .
our system systems are not only shaped by these ways , not only  UNK  by the stigma , but also caused by the poor .
and the threat of terrorism is to make their lives .
i don &apos;t know how to use  UNK  .
it &apos;s a game playing game .
so every morning , i stood on the ground , and before i walked up to the car , people started to tell me me , &quot; i think you &apos;re lunch . &quot;
and if the  UNK  you can &apos;t tell you , then your consumer .
sometimes they form illusions .
this is a map from the chamber and out the light and it converts the direction to the rest of the book .
we also led to  UNK  design .
and we can &apos;t stabilize the government until we do a good job .
and that means 10 times the ball , the dalai lama .
so you &apos;ve heard and saw that the audience of the audience , the ted community to help him on their path and do something for this issue .
and there are only about 12 percent of their decisions that they &apos;re actually working on an hour or more than that .
skeletons is surrounded by plants , you can see , some of the trees .
1,000 , great .
about 10 minutes later when the judge was a makeover .
i think that our personalities is  UNK  .
when i was a kid , when i looked at her she would come to me and hug me .
this is a male car that you give you an opportunity to get your own .
but they do work .
UNK   UNK  :  UNK   UNK  to the number of fish , and they actually have a little bit more likely to get more than average income in ghana .
we want to make the world of our buildings , innovators and people , because this world , where we are living , our world .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i would say that later would be done in africa .
the other patients with diarrhea .
what can we help you ? &quot;
last year , we have a team of three people working in an 18-month project and boston .
and in fear , there &apos;s only a huge amount of  UNK  , get a lot of views , and become a cultural phenomenon .
now if i talk about cities , for example , technology , could be a technological technology , on a curve curve , it would be absurd , like a straight line .
and so , i could do the same evolution of a million years in a few minutes , or in the case , a few cases .
so the lesson i did with  UNK   UNK  and  UNK   UNK  , and we made a whole bunch of people that were working at  UNK  , and now that people were in a phase that they could  UNK  their 401 plan .
the little thing we add , we asked people to figure out what &apos;s going to know about what &apos;s going to happen in their future if they save .
and so all of these are different .
if we were arrested , first of them to me and me , and my mother would drink .
they &apos;re always anxious they &apos;ll be about their position .
and it &apos;s a long beach , because i had to wait for six years .
this is your  UNK  .
we took a few different candidate every year , they will work with the city government .
for example , the  UNK  story has been told about the captain , seeing a lot of fish in the region that weren &apos;t going to be treated or nay , because they &apos;re not scientifically validated by the  UNK  .
he &apos;s just hitting it .
and finally , i believe that the fact is that this is very , very exciting , and very frustrating , but we &apos;re not going to be driven by the technology that we created by our technology , by intellectual and the ideal .
in fact , a lot of people , and scientists would argue that it was very different .
it &apos;s going to happen when it &apos;s not normal , and instead of  UNK  here , a little piece of blood pressure , and then the  UNK   UNK  , and the
people should think that this problem is that when people in society , &quot; they killed animals , and they don &apos;t know what they did .
and so they &apos;re going to survive , as well , it also means that , if a team of good  UNK  , all the individuals within the community , and they form in positive ways .
and i met her  UNK  , she was born .
they come from the ideas that are enthralled by faith .
it &apos;s called bricks .
my mother , her first year , her 18 year-old mother -- her family , a  UNK  marriage , had two girls .
i don &apos;t know intimately .
in both cases , this is all these  UNK  that are consistent , because in fact , we don &apos;t even know this issue that we ought to be like that .
and for me , the combination of these things are essential .
because , for example , the drug resistance could be shaped .
if i just showed you how to cultivate the paper magazine , and i split it out how to do you about 400 jobs and split it down to 20 bucks you believe that i gave you more options and better options options , if i give you to 600 bucks .
a few days later , we went to an iraqi  UNK  in massachusetts and sat in her  UNK  .
it &apos;s not just the members of code for america , but hundreds of hundreds of people on the developing world today .
we all heard about the papers , we all heard about the paintings , but there &apos;s no exceptions in india india ?
i met people from each society , a lot of people working in love , living in the boundaries of the opportunity .
the idea behind the view is that it &apos;s like a kind of fez library .
but now , the videos on the web are doing that to allow any of us , or whatever we &apos;ve been able to become fully famous in a culture of our world .
we set up a website , and we asked the crowd , &quot; if you see a  UNK  device , please send us information that we know when it works , because sometimes it &apos;s not working .
we &apos;re seeing this process from pushing ourselves .
i was  UNK   UNK  for three  UNK  .
and there are many other projects in each other system .
it &apos;s a rich , not that i don &apos;t have any impact on the outcome .
in the next week , a device will be released .
people think politics is compelling .
the baseball is running the astonishing statistics .
and when i heard three poems , three months ago .
now we &apos;re going to accelerate the time frame again .
oh , i do all right ?
her mother was breastfeeding .
so please let us do this and not just to make health better and even control it .
this is a typical example of the government responding .
and the technology of this technology is 50 percent to me .
and that &apos;s the brain and the neurons system .
it &apos;s actually just looking at different realities .
so we all have the brain , because the brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the element of the reality .
we even have it in the cell phone .
so there &apos;s nothing changed , but everything changed .
and at that time , we have a colony colony cells , different populations of different cells , working together as a single single organ .
well , if you can catch this conference up .
so when i asked you a question of what i don &apos;t see , if you want to burn a loss of weight , just your hands .
the fear of terror is the , rebel , and death .
some of the typical examples of the coming from the world who make the money from their attacks .
the difference needs to say something that i choose , rather than a choice .
the first story of charles darwin , one of my heroes .
we have a generation that grew up with the development of the internet , and we know what &apos;s hard to be able to fit together , you just need to control the system .
two years later i was dr. president in the emergency room in a hospital in the northern community of toronto , and i was a 12-year-old boy who was  UNK  .
and i think that &apos;s starting from a doctor , that &apos;s me .
because , of course , a kind of animal with very large quantities , before it was extinct .
now , one thing at the same time at least six times what you want to buy a  UNK  bottle when they see six of them .
i fear the idea that i &apos;m going to get irritated and enjoy the lights without the camera , but i don &apos;t wear up on twitter .
there &apos;s a crazy line of how it doesn &apos;t have the right thing in the country all .
secondly , combination of the photos should have the same kind of light .
eight years ago when i was in the media lab , i discovered the idea that idea was to be able to engineer to come to come to come to the artists and artists .
but the chances are not going to be authorized .
and that &apos;s true . it &apos;s a weekday veg .
that &apos;s the system .
the second industrial industry we see today is not because of making money .
secondly , friday . sixth on friday , people are looking forward on weekends , saturday 6 , and six seconds , you &apos;re not going to talk about today , i hope .
and he was just plowing and watch a hundred people on the day , the camera came back into .
it &apos;s actually violence against violence .
thank you .
they haven &apos;t handed up .
and i mean , i &apos;m not the trick or i , i mean , you &apos;re kind of  UNK  , but we &apos;re all of them .
now what is today ?
why can a judge can put you into a person that you &apos;re not ?
he always looked at the window window , and he could listen to all losers .
you can do a huge amount of change .
we &apos;re hard to talk about this issue of ethnicity , which is that we don &apos;t we &apos;re not willing to admire the truth and reconciliation .
and what we see is is the number of valuable resources in our pension health care , which means that our chances are able to save more tomorrow .
i actually learned this .
the other thing we &apos;re hoping to hope is that the companies around the world can help us maintain this computerized device .
they want to tell their story . they want to share their story .
are we going to be able to do what we need to do without borders , for all of us ?
all right . thank you very much .
and while we still believe in the right now , right here at the summit of that 2011 , every single time we lose all of us were better .
we &apos;re very poor .
it &apos;s semantic imagery ,  UNK  , auditory , and the touch .
it &apos;s all important .
in egypt , when the  UNK   UNK  of the police department of egypt , in 1600 2011 , they discovered a lot of cards .
you &apos;re blue , green , you can make the circuits .
and put the  UNK  index .
and then the woman came to tell their stories about unarmed men who cannot tolerate their lives , anger and  UNK  , and the young  UNK  between the two worlds .
sometimes , i went and and on the side , but it &apos;s hard to get her attention to me .
for example example : how  UNK  works , or why the triggers of the  UNK  vending machine , the ipod picks the snipers .
i gave three  UNK  without the  UNK  .
in the last week , in a meeting with the dutch government , i had a question for the leadership of whether that if he had a certain sense if there was somebody who had to die of orgasm .
my name is brian .
now , i talked a lot about the magic .
another idea that  UNK  me when i was a tiny galaxy that could be put into a single  UNK  .
technology is ...
but it doesn &apos;t have to make a video .
over time , we are very few , and we think this is sugar .
we are  UNK  .
and the english language in the conversation , but they have one of them , they &apos;re starting to go back .
my  UNK  kept around everywhere .
and we built an app on the ipad .
and they are the most primitive patterns , but it &apos;s the little  UNK  .
why do people use the 15 to 30 percent when they use the machine or  UNK  ?
UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  . &quot;
seriously .
it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s what we think it &apos;s real .
i went to room .
even in the first seven days , in every day a day video was uploaded .
in another chapter , you have to take a picture of a tree , and that &apos;s called it .
and let them copy them through the same shell like the reproduction . &quot;
in fact , one of the things that i &apos;ve done to do is we can now make a lot of these things .
the third principle is to make it happen in real life where the different pictures began to end and end by making them .
and by the way to beat the power of power -- we remember , &quot; what are we humans ? &quot; -- what do we think about it .
this brew continues to be transparent and becoming , i guess ,  UNK  is  UNK  -- when an exponential cycle transformation .
we &apos;re never going to do that in our own country .
so an app was built in a few days , and it was very simplified , it &apos;s a shortcut to build the government system .
fear fear and the political pundit decreed us believe that this is not , and the problem we have .
we have all encoded in the car .
it &apos;s not like the suburbs of the middle east , but i don &apos;t know whether there is no one there .
it just taught me very simple things .
i know a lot of different times when they nurture the  UNK  of the kidney .
and you can talk about lots of things around the world .
she grew up in the age of  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  and  UNK   UNK  .
so what i want to talk to you about is that the body is the phase we &apos;re going through .
do you know how many choices you spend about five minutes ?
and so , there &apos;s a spike .
and i claim that today is the threat that we &apos;re becoming the victims of the larger than the risk in the real world .
when i was 17 years old , she became an opponent of his pants ,  UNK  him .
could i be able to give me a  UNK  in my life , the big  UNK  in the world ,  UNK   UNK  , no , no matter of violence ?
this is a shop with the  UNK  .
look at what &apos;s going on in the world , we can unlock the attacks attacks .
last year , the  UNK   UNK  showed this video tube to his house in the national park .
if you have an opportunity to work in the center of the city , like scott  UNK  , a member of us -- in fact , all of them -- you &apos;ll find that people called me to a lot of problems , there &apos;s a  UNK  rat in your house .
&quot; the first thing she wanted to be taught me was always loved to love . &quot;
the u.s. is the only country in the world who spends 13 years old .
and it &apos;s the only country in the world to do this .
my mother was now at the age of my mother when we went to the boat .
but it &apos;s an individual or an individual or a group of people who created an  UNK  , and they share with more of the audience , to make a  UNK  process .
i remember like that day , like that happens .
according to estimates , there are 400 400 billion bricks that are produced -- or 75 percent of people on earth .
they find them with government , but they don &apos;t complain , they find them .
you can see it in the snow .
it knows where we are .
no one must be your ideas .
and so , the great role of the reserve that can be improved .
stephen  UNK  .
because evolution evolution can happen inside .
in fact , our genes , there &apos;s the exact same principle , and there &apos;s a  UNK  .
so , imagine him , an emt came into the  UNK  , the fact that his life was  UNK  .
and of course , the  UNK   UNK  will not be able to get the numbers , so , no , no one that will be done .
by many ways , we &apos;re taught to believe that the real question is that people are dying unnecessarily ?
the west of the west also do that day .
for those things , the mistake is  UNK  .
this mountain mountain is actually collected by the fishermen in the times they go to uncharted disasters .
i said , &quot; what are you saying ? &quot;
what i want to show you is not the detailed details of the report that &apos;s what they are .
i &apos;ll never forget her .
UNK   UNK  in  UNK   UNK  , now ,  UNK  and  UNK  society , where they were in the places that have never heard of the houses that have never been imagined .
my mother never accepted is not going to be successful .
UNK  !
i said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer . he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot;
it became a barrier to see a gold world of  UNK  and  UNK  and the images in my imagination .
after all day , i did a giant patchwork , so we also eat .
this is just a random front page that i chose from my own .
so half a half of them comes from a lot of options , and then the red line , i &apos;ve four options , four engines .
it &apos;s imperative .
and i mentioned this is because i think it &apos;s really important .
just because they didn &apos;t know it .
if someone like to take hundreds of millions of millions of my business cards , i could introduce people in this room so many of you , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
the conclusion we &apos;re finding is that magic can be replaced by machines .
well , the fourth theory , e = complexity .
this is a small application .
and what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
what we can see , we didn &apos;t find out there .
i think the reasons of this is because we all feel that &apos;s happening at the time .
this story . we heard a lot of times about the galapagos and others . so there &apos;s nothing special about it .
in the united states , the institute of the warranty budget .
it says , &quot; this plane has the same exact same exact same activity at the same time , you &apos;ve got to be safe . &quot; it doesn &apos;t you feel confident ? &quot;
so , they tend to survive even more .
i &apos;m not talking about the definition of the system .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
and she was born in the &apos; 70s and had to left the irs  UNK  , which was shaped by her life .
it &apos;s got a  UNK  in the middle to initiate the sock .
and they came to the evolution in evolution .
you don &apos;t need to be an engineer to be able to build beautiful , beautiful movies or beautiful buildings .
for example , in germany , a couple of weeks ago ,  UNK   UNK   UNK  , which is a  UNK  , the  UNK  government used to support their people .
and when i heard the  UNK  of the  UNK  , i could hear the  UNK   UNK  in both of the two .
because i think the only way to understand this is actually actually put yourself into the past and take a long-term view of everything .
and do you know what people don &apos;t want to talk about their worst circumstances ?
now if i look at these programs , i couldn &apos;t tell people how they work .
nobody knows where the world &apos;s fastest  UNK  to save lives on right now .
we have here in three dimensions that we have a perfect image , but we can all partake in life in the three-dimensional world .
okay , she &apos;s got to go back .
i actually think that the ted community needs to be brave .
and for eight or nine days , they give their fates .
there are three  UNK  sources .
and i led to understand and believe that we have to be the worst thing that we &apos;ve ever done .
this is happening with us today .
now , it &apos;s now the technology that &apos;s going to improve a lot of the government of the government to do understand how much more productive .
this diagnosis is not difficult .
the center is setup .
come on me .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident that they do work because they come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs programs that work .
i love technology , love to creativity .
this is the  UNK  oil .
and i went back to work in the clinic .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m very proud of you . &quot;
the next process , like the language and the same thing that happens in less than a million years .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you a lesson that i had with  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , which is where we &apos;re going to look at the cost of saving money from a million years of a million americans in the u.s.
&quot; when we &apos;re in eastern europe , dealing with the exchange we want to get all of us to be in love with a spiritual mental illness and the willingness to grieve and sometimes to be a staff . &quot;
and i also feel good .
knowing that we can &apos;t make people how we care about human rights and dignity .
we &apos;re taking solar power .
what we do is they do , including me in the world with the serpent , to be perfect .
it turns out that the amazon  UNK   UNK  , and under the corridors of the new york city in new delhi , where all the different types of the different types of  UNK
maybe a couple of life .
because at the moment , an animal -- that information could happen in a period of living life , rather than in this evolution .
i looked through the  UNK  and the  UNK  on the other side .
here , these are  UNK  .
so , apply this story in my medical world to a much more difficult topic for me , but perhaps even more quickly , and what i &apos;m going to show you to you .
and finally , he said , &quot; look , don &apos;t you have to open all of your door to your house and playing music , and you can play the real ? &quot;
all right , much better .
but that &apos;s not all the  UNK  mouse .
i know she had come to me .
the engine ,  UNK  , there are four options .
this allows us to start as a living organism .
we predict that 10 years more than half the citizens , as before the election .
i said to the computer , &quot; let &apos;s move forward . &quot;
and only working in the culture of medicine that the system is controlled by people , and when people control the system , they will get the wrong effect .
he said , &quot; never been a choice .
i gave her three  UNK  . i told the drugs to get the activity of the heart .
and then there &apos;s this community was made out of the people who came to this story , and they began to talk and do something about it .
there are three reasons : the people who create the  UNK  , communities and participating .
so we have three groups of  UNK   UNK  : the gangsters with the money , the  UNK  working , and the ultimately to our government .
it shows that we can actually solve a lot more information , we can make them more easily .
i had a great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , i met a park .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s about two programs , and they &apos;re going to create products by giving their rules , and they &apos;re the  UNK  of the principles of the rules .
UNK  anderson ,  UNK   UNK  and so forth .
i didn &apos;t have anything  UNK  .
what about the people who can &apos;t do it ? because they don &apos;t have access to -- but in the  UNK  ?
but when you look at this problem , it &apos;s going to be like , &quot; ok , it &apos;s not going to be irritating , but it doesn &apos;t affect me because i am a citizen .
it &apos;s just a basic chemical form of life , but everything else happens when it &apos;s a little bit disappointed .
even though , we seem to feel comfortable about this .
and partly part of that story is sometimes due to the time .
but what makes this device is simply any when i stand up , and it sends my data through google .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually do , but i always want it to look like in  UNK  in a way like an image .
or it will turn into a texture like this , until something different happens , or maybe , it &apos;s going to switch into this .
i watched her him , it was a little bit  UNK  .
for the organizers of  UNK  ,  UNK  became a different material , a new material .
if you generalize this to something , something like this will happen .
our country , it &apos;s gone down to a lot of 40 years ago .
and then it &apos;s international .
and us , in the west can &apos;t understand why these things can be true , but that &apos;s the rules of the freedom of freedom .
fifty percent of the men &apos;s staff for nine minutes or less .
the other thing that &apos;s really important for me is to create the content of the
judge them again .
in fact , they &apos;re a much more effective program that i can train .
but it actually requires a lot of plans .
the next process is happening in these neighborhoods .
but when you combine the pictures , it &apos;s an important thing to think about , because if it &apos;s not going to be .
and the rest of that day , that contraption , i felt like  UNK  sensations .
what do i mean ?
but today , at this point at the moment in 2011 , if you have bought a piece of  UNK  from a vending machine , and if you try to print a blank page , which is going to be the yellow ones that you can see in a certain kind of manifest , to get the flow of the input and your printer .
when i was a graduate student from college , i &apos;ve been spent a lot of a lot of grocery stores , and then i was quite a big .
sometimes i have a good .
i used it to do survey for the south of the sea sea in the middle of the two years of china and special  UNK  .
for example , the most complex version we know is the language of humankind .
but in a certain way , they create something that in the same way , as if it exists .
and so i had perfect .
in 2010 , this has 23 million views .
and what &apos;s interesting is that when i teach my students in the american history of south africa .
for the poor , the people who are the to argue that their actions have to live with poo .
according to our time to focus on large animals in the sea , we focus on these big fish .
never , celine is not mistaken , but you &apos;re worried about small detail , about how they &apos;re wrong .
if we call the center of the animal , it will cost much more money .
the only thing that i &apos;ve done is that i &apos;ve changed the way that information is embedded in there .
and the more i said , i was a lot .
but i remember him from the oil from the coast of the coast , and a young man who had fled russia , and the end of the journey was to  UNK  with him , and through the first apple that i was thrown , through the  UNK  of  UNK  .
and i kept asking myself .
and at the same time , there are no maps , but these maps are .
what makes the illusions ?
it &apos;s a good news , because we &apos;re going to have more than the  UNK  actions of technology .
why do i learned ?
today there are nine cities working on this app .
on the day , i ran up to the hospital and walking around me to send the car , to get back to the house and i do something i don &apos;t usually do .
the united states senate , two months ago , the swiss  UNK  bank trader , who was in his  UNK  with a million dollars in the  UNK  .
so for example , there &apos;s a 300 football player .
it &apos;s not political , but the bureaucratic system .
our idea is crazy , but some great ideas are , and we created the breakthrough .
and in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we human beings , we started learning .
he was the poet , the playwright , who had a life of his life on the tip of the only that his country would be free .
i &apos;m human . i &apos;m wrong .
it also gave me a little bit about this incredible dedication that i connected with it , and i was very happy , and i was busy .
because it  UNK  for something that &apos;s gone .
and we all feel some of our own cultural vocabulary .
and they found out that the ceo had done about a mission in a week .
to make the glow faster or slower , you just take the  UNK  , and to change the pace of light .
because that &apos;s what you do when you &apos;re a  UNK  , the polar bear in the mountain .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here , in the end of the curve .
and i realized that i thought it would be easier to even make a concrete rather than just the context , because then you don &apos;t have to organize the ideas in your head .
and in fact , i turn into a character in the book .
we want to maintain the things that didn &apos;t have any of the same .
they are very ambiguous programs .
i also experienced a long time living in the community with low-income income projects and where the despair of despair .
and the number of people are  UNK  .
so i &apos;m talking about youth unemployment and education , and about people who are  UNK  ,  UNK  and  UNK  .
now , if you could achieve higher .
and he said , &quot; aah , what do you do ? &quot;
my grandmother is sitting next to me .
sometimes , even though , i hear the pages of  UNK  , &quot; and sometimes there are on the wall : &quot; you know , you &apos;re home . &quot;
but what they &apos;re actually doing crazy , everything that happens in the world today .
i grew up in southern southern nevada and there &apos;s a brother , much larger than i met a two-year-old and a girl , a little bit more than a teenager .
that allows you to understand the difference between the choices that they have to be able to understand the cause of the choices and the results that are very clear .
well , i love my mother , so i promised &quot; well , yeah , you &apos;re going to do . &quot;
well ,  UNK  .  UNK  , and a lot of online tests started writing about it .
but on the retail of the retail of the retail of the world today , and that &apos;s just  UNK  , and it &apos;s just a  UNK  .
but i fear the privilege of  UNK  , my life satisfaction , your life .
and that happens .
fifteen , 20 minutes of three days , and then you could go back and forth , and i said she said , &quot; well ,  UNK  . &quot;
and we know that it doesn &apos;t matter to think about 30 , 50 years later , all of the things that would become very different from the very simple , very simple way that we &apos;re going to have today .
thank you for ted . thank you .
and i have to tell you that that made me me .
oh my god . oh my god .
and in the worst moments : why bother the false mistake ?
and in fact , we &apos;re an embryonic stem cells .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
instead , what i do is what i &apos;ve been doing , and the things that we &apos;re doing at the level of the dna that we think about the level of the filter , and we put that filter into the machine athleticism and we use the filter filter that we can do , and further than we can .
on the other hand , it &apos;s also used to pull people out of the sitting in which houses together in their own life .
for almost 200 million views .
i think i &apos;ll hear a lot better .
but this brings me .
my third story story is that when i was a  UNK  collector , taking the boat from the boat of the boat .
do you think it &apos;s a  UNK  surgeon , a nurse or an orthopedic surgeon , an  UNK  .
we have a lot of cells that they can &apos;t survive .
and you know the patient , you can get more information about three .
because of course , i know how to arrange them .
and of course , terrorism has been  UNK  by ethnicity and thousands of civil wars .
how do i teach them what i did to do they do not ?
and he got closer and closer and hugged me .
words , through the next few years , you &apos;re with him , he plays him .
and it &apos;s always a lot of controversy in a family .
in the future , most of the guerrilla will happen in the world .
legendary  UNK  -- the lhc grew up at ted -- the first big  UNK  of the dow transplant on the top of an hour .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t give the patient &apos;s patients and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s anything .
there &apos;s a woman who &apos;s got a couple of years old . she &apos;s got a series of success .
and i said , &quot;
many of the community have been  UNK  .
this is an issue of freedom and control .
my father had never allowed me to forget his life .
it can happen in the process of information .
you know , if you &apos;re kind of healthy , when you see a secret that you express yourself , you &apos;ve never been able to get out of you and then you get knocked out of your ears and you &apos;ve got the most dramatic visuals , but at the end of the worst of the way you feel the path of your sugar and you say , i &apos;m never going to be wrong like that .
my mother , my sister and i slept with them on a bed .
you don &apos;t have a baseball  UNK  , right ?
two halves of shutting to go to school , every time to get away on the hill .
these colonies , once again , starting to get information .
there &apos;s no good .
the next step we find solutions for it .
i &apos;m going to start by giving a short term report about science .
so the first step of the story i told people in a billion years .
my brother said , &quot; well , well , we &apos;re doing today , and i always do what you do and my sister . &quot;
there was a documentary called  UNK  . &quot;
they were three  UNK  transplant .
she was  UNK  , powerful , powerful and powerful in our family .
and there are hundreds of these numbers .
have you ever seen these people ?
when he was born with an appointment , and told us that he had to fill that .
when i was a big kid , the future for me is the year 2000 , and people are what &apos;s going to happen in 2000 .
these pictures are completely created by images from different regions .
&quot; not only  UNK  . &quot;
so it &apos;s not as a huge loss .
we work in a system that &apos;s going to happen every single day , and there &apos;s a few or less likely to be , or in the patients who are from patients who are able to conquer and conquer .
so , if technology is advancing technology as technology as technology , then i can call a taxi and go to the next 30 seconds .
and i &apos;m from  UNK  to myself that if i tried to make a little bit easier and never going to be wrong , please let the trigger of the conscience .
for those who are choosing more options , more and more people to participate in  UNK  .
and i &apos;ve been waiting for children who are frustrated .
the book is &quot; the &quot; &quot; the verdict is going to be published , and it &apos;s basically talking about statistics statistics and use the data to build a baseball baseball .
the skin cell will not have any effect if the lack of the heart of the heart , the cells , the brain stem cells .
so they wanted to kill it for beef .
this is a generation of her voice to fight for the rights .
but for americans in africa , it &apos;s an awful lot .
pipa is  UNK  ; and nobody knows where he is .
my story started right here , in rajasthan to about two years ago .
i &apos;ve been talking about four technical problems to solve in the  UNK  options -- that &apos;s the ability to make it easier -- in fact -- to make it more practical .
we &apos;re seeing a lot of fun in our jobs .
we don &apos;t know from life anymore .
my mission was to work when her mother was a nightmare to beat her teaching .
some of the bacteria find out how to nurture the fuel , and it turns out around the exchange of their dna with other bacteria , and today we have a lot of bacteria that can afford to kill , because bacteria are dna .
a minority are infected .
and when you use your camera to take pictures , you move forward .
and of course , every task is made a lot of small options .
because the process is that it &apos;s so hard to know when we &apos;re in the middle of the process .
or these pictures like this -- both of the and dark , but with all of a common outcome of authenticity .
so this video is scrolling up in a month .
in fact , we all know that the design process was not designed when it was complicated .
they don &apos;t seem to make them less happy when they get better .
i mean , as you mentioned earlier , one of the largest stars in the world today , justin bieber , starting with youtube .
and why , today &apos;s children today .
i would like to be successful and from the responsibility to  UNK  , and i made the patient from the patient , but not to contact with him .
well , for example , if you live in california , you &apos;re going to have an instantaneous  UNK  here , we &apos;re going to work in a part of the use of
what about the arab spring and what has happened in egypt ?
the subject today is going to continue : to save statistics .
and these two pictures also have two knobs -- are born at the same time and at the same kind of light .
but every time , they all  UNK  me .
this is a very sophisticated question .
i fear that i went to  UNK  .
we were six six different types of different smells or different types of different types of different smells , and we realized that two things : the first thing , in the case of the people want to stop , throw out there ?
and not even a single company , it &apos;s like the internet .
that kind of says , not what you do is bad , but you &apos;re bad .
that &apos;s the red blood pressure to connect with the iphone or something else .
because we &apos;re also talking about necessity to hope more and more than to the basic challenges of life , in this complex world .
the kind of oil is that we &apos;re out there .
thank you very much .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
you &apos;re probably going to be able to see color and look like &quot; movies . &quot;
i don &apos;t know anything about anything .
and that &apos;s at the three  UNK   UNK  , i put my hand on my face , and he said , &quot; so he should be brave , courage and courage .
so , nine people were slaughtered from us to find an innocent innocent and drop out of prison .
now , i &apos;m optimistic , so i think it can go in this way .
this is a quick video shows what we &apos;re doing .
they use their hands .
where the world is moving ?
and i collected a little team with us , &quot; no , &quot; no , was a very clever challenge .
thank you .
and even when he was walking out of his life , he was kind of just waiting for her .
and since i was too late , i didn &apos;t think about a system that i started writing a proposal .
the people came up and said to me , &quot; mr.  UNK  , you have these conversations , but talk to the people who have to say that we don &apos;t confront the next time in the first time in haiti after 9 / 11 .
it looks like looking at a date , but actually it &apos;s waiting for somebody , because he knows that you &apos;re not at good at the  UNK   UNK  .
because now we &apos;re not just enjoying it , but we do .
how can it look for help you have an example of this ?
with her mother , life was on the only mission task to leave her mother and the new life in australia .
we still think it &apos;s  UNK  .
people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
i live in the second world .
UNK  is a company provider .
and one of the most important things that i realized was in the short time that came to me was this ted ted .
when we &apos;re not interested in difficult things , the good things are affected .
let me show you how they work .
i &apos;m going to give you an example of what i &apos;m talking about .
well , yeah , you &apos;re an old party , and you listen to a story of a doctor , but you wouldn &apos;t hear somebody else &apos;s wrong .
i pay attention from the community .
there was an impact on the planet .
once we got a baby .
