she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
what does it mean ?
i didn &apos;t know how to use the  UNK  .
and here &apos;s the thing .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
four years ago here at ted , ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
i &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
they will even use tools like state trojan to infect your computer with a trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
but combined , they can create something like this .
and when i listened to her chest with a stethoscope , i could hear  UNK  sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
my hunches again .
i represent children .
here &apos;s vladimir  UNK  form  UNK  in estonia .
is it something about the light ?
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
UNK   UNK  , the great czech leader , talked about this .
legendary -- as in ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to  UNK  .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a gotcha way , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody can benefit .
what does this mean ?
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
and they did .
it &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
they put her on a ventilator .
and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court .
it &apos;s a lobster made of  UNK  that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
my mother phoned minutes later .
we have online criminals .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
so what happened on this day ?
so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , i have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
now look at this curve .
hi . i &apos;m kevin  UNK  , i &apos;m the trends manager at youtube , and i professionally watch youtube videos .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
we have our cognitive biases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the  UNK  health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
i spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row .
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the  UNK  projects fail , since we stopped listening .
now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
so meet al .
these people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were  UNK  .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
i mean , that was epic .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
can i give them a bow in their lives , dipping bravely into each wave , the  UNK  and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarantees nothing ?
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
something really weird is going on here .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple  UNK  of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
1,000 , very good .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
and she &apos;d squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
and at the end of the day , i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citizen .
the redefined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
it would be  UNK  .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
and to my horror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
the unhealthy shame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an  UNK  suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtuous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
well  UNK  picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
but there &apos;s another thing .
these might be  UNK  services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the  UNK  that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call  UNK  in your city .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of  UNK  took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being  UNK  active .
tan le , anonymous  UNK  resident , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
nobody knew where the nearest life-saving  UNK  was to be obtained right now .
so every morning i hop on my wifi scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light lunch today ,  UNK  . &quot;
now why do we draw technology curves in  UNK  curves ?
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i hop on , it sends my data through google health as well .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that &apos;s when ms.  UNK  leaned forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave , brave , brave . &quot;
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14-year-old black male client like a privileged , white  UNK  corporate executive . &quot;
and also , even though it &apos;s plotted on a log curve on the left , it &apos;s  UNK  upwards .
and that was my first time to be  UNK  with that .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the  UNK  time scale .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
you should ask for some of that .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scott  UNK  did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
recession . default . doomsday . egypt . syria .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
he kept pointing here .
well it was a friday , this is true .
she shares her experience with others .
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
and there is this stunning silence .
they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pike in health .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
three things :  UNK  , communities of participation and  UNK  .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
it might take a moment to load .
and i put my challenge on 95  UNK  .
wooo !
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in  UNK  and sat around her  UNK  .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was executing people , especially if they were disproportionately jewish ?
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
and he whispered in my ear .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called state trojan was found , which was a trojan used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
we love innovation .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are  UNK  by crime , not do less .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
pretty simple .
but where would be the nearest  UNK  to help this patient ?
when i say realism , i mean  UNK  .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they &apos;re fixing it .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he  UNK  things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get sued .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr. stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
so  UNK  is open-source .
they had to worry about being bombed .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
and it was what i was feeling .
well i adored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
and to report back to my attending .
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
and i began giving her my rap .
thank you very much .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
how could we help you ? &quot;
we asked around and nobody knew .
and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains .
threats , in the wake of bin laden &apos;s death , have spiked .
now the amygdala is our early warning detector , our danger detector .
okay . thank you very much .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
underpinning much of this is technology , and of late , exponentially growing technologies .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
and i love this : &quot; watson  UNK  human opponents . &quot;
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
and the more  UNK  i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
in one , i was the classic asian student , relentless in the demands that i made on myself .
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
very quickly concrete blocks became the  UNK  construction unit in the world .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart .
tsunami warning .  UNK  .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of dna .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
grants and sponsors were sought .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
yes ,  UNK  percent is saltwater , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
my goodness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013 .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
better than that , the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- gps , hd video and still images , libraries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally  UNK  and  UNK  into your cellphone .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
and there &apos;s nothing  UNK  in the history of technology development of this kind of  UNK  growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
you know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us  UNK  these  UNK  .
i gave her my whole rap , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mmm mmm mmm . &quot;
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
something  UNK  inside me .
we worked well into each night .
because i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the trashcan behind the house .
the shores are from a different location .
he had a potentially life-threatening condition called  UNK  .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball  UNK  ?
in fact , so lacking in confidence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs.  UNK  , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
so to achieve a realistic result , i think it comes down to planning .
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
and i go to the jail and i see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
and i studied in my little  UNK  at the nurses &apos; residence at toronto general hospital , not far from here .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the  UNK  layer on top .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
and these women would get together and just talk .
i never knew him in real life .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all misconduct .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates .
she had irreversible brain damage .
and it &apos;s collected by my general practitioner as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need  UNK  support or something like it , but also looking backward .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &quot;
there &apos;s nanotechnology coming on ,  UNK  .
so let &apos;s project this analogy going forward .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and the nurse thought about it and said very  UNK  , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
and that &apos;s important .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started arguing .
i will never forget it .
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
it would be  UNK  for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about executing people . &quot;
we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race , they &apos;re also distorted by poverty .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
and these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infection , not of the throat , but of the upper  UNK  , and it can actually cause the  UNK  to close .
and this has spread just  UNK  , organically , naturally .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that  UNK  organisms have gone through --  UNK  out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
for a year we were penniless .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
solar technology is ...
even cats were watching this video .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
all right , let &apos;s go .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and platinum .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
i memorized in my anatomy class the origins and  UNK  of every muscle , every branch of every artery that came off the aorta , differential diagnoses obscure and common .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so i decided to change that .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an  UNK  institution , but as a problem of collective action .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
well  UNK  is a  UNK
and certainly , we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along , and many people do .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
defeat would have come too easily .
the other nurse asked  UNK  .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a  UNK  resident .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
the company headquarters are right here .
someone made an old  UNK  version .
it &apos;s spreading virally .
and here every piece is very well planned .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
they had sold this tool for  UNK  euros to the egyptian government .
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
this is happening to us today .
my mother ,  UNK  , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
and i have to tell you , it was  UNK  .
UNK  software usually takes a couple of years .
but when something like this happens , things are qualitatively changing .
have you seen these guys ?
he kept pacing back and forth .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
this is matthew anderson ,  UNK   UNK  and so on and so on .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
we actually have several cases of millionaires online ,  UNK  , who made money with their attacks .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot;
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as  UNK  , which is what the product is called , but also  UNK  .
so the white lines here are population .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
and as i was walking up the steps of this courthouse , there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
after only one trip .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a doll .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
and i felt really good .
telephony , computers ,  UNK  , cd-roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
but ultimately , those realities are  UNK  by suffering , abuse , degradation , marginalization .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
they &apos;re  UNK  to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immunize me against making mistakes .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &quot;
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
this is the kind of innovation , empowered by this technology , that exists today .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
mr. jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy .
i gave her medications that we call  UNK  , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .
well you need a certificate if you have a website that has  UNK  ,  UNK  encrypted services , services like gmail .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . &quot;
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
except they can if they hack into a foreign  UNK
for the first time , this year the cost of  UNK  electricity is 50 percent that of  UNK  electricity in india --  UNK  rupees versus 17 rupees .
and i put in my motion that there was  UNK  misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct .
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
it will get to you .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
drug war . mass destruction . tornado .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
they will tap your internet connection .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of  UNK  .
societal decay . 65 dead .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
they &apos;re using their hands .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re  UNK  ourselves .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
and whenever you are in a city like  UNK  and somebody collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cellphone , to find the nearest  UNK  which can save lives .
we settled in  UNK  , a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
and it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult , to see that patient in  UNK  .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .
no one has to  UNK  your idea .
and i think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
perhaps instead , it &apos;s the  UNK  brought to us of what &apos;s really going on .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the  UNK  and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .
an entire remix community  UNK  up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
and because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
score them again .
in fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
and i claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
her father died soon after she was born .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
rebecca black &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it sorts and  UNK  through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us .
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been  UNK  and released from death row .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
in both cases , these are gross  UNK  , because we really aren &apos;t  UNK  out the problem as we should .
UNK  .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on  UNK  .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it &apos;s not our problem .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
twice in one emergency shift , i missed  UNK  .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
it &apos;s not just code for america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers .
in sending her home , i  UNK  a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
this is not ...
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
i ordered some fluids to  UNK  him and asked my colleague to reassess him .
these guys make money .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish .
we have the passion of the diy innovator .
UNK  are electronic modules with each one specific function .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an  UNK  , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
say , &quot; please repeat that process . &quot;
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little  UNK  .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
centers were established .
UNK  is a certificate authority from the netherlands -- or actually , it was .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field ,  UNK  colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
now i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extinction , water and energy shortage -- we surely do .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things ,  UNK  . &quot;
and rather than having economic  UNK  , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic injection ever .
UNK  ,  UNK  !
i don &apos;t believe that .
slowly but surely , it lifted .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
because evolution could now happen within an individual .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
he is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a  UNK  community .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a supercomputer problem .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
so after a four-year saga that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done historically .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? &quot;
jimmy  UNK  actually .
why should i worry ?
what creates the illusion ?
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get selected out .
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
and she &apos;s hitting a  UNK  .
it &apos;s called batting average .
you can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
and i did well , i graduated with honors ,  UNK   UNK  .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie , geeky internet culture .
well she was back all right .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;all go ahead . y &apos;all go ahead . &quot;
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
so i signed the discharge papers , and an ambulance came ,  UNK  came to take her home .
but the king of  UNK  , he was fed with aluminum  UNK  .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a  UNK  brick .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
and one of the things we did at  UNK  university is we appointed a chief listening officer .
i was devastated .
that means that  UNK   UNK  safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
if you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
imagine him as the communists enter  UNK  , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times , but were  UNK  by the  UNK  of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
and i think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
and we built an ipad application .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
i represent people on death row .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
crisis . death . disaster .
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
so scott gets this call .
at 17 she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into  UNK  organisms .
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so what was the next step ?
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
16 terawatts of energy hits the earth &apos;s surface every 88 minutes .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
so go ahead and start inventing .
opossum ? check . living ? yep .
it came out of the university of washington in seattle .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
so what we did , we crowdsourced the netherlands .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
the idea behind  UNK  is that it &apos;s a growing library .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
for example , how a  UNK  works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
so &quot;  UNK  cat &quot; is a looped animation with looped music .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
and on this curve , riding on moore &apos;s law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
this is a modest little app .
they were there in february , and it snowed a lot in february last year .
and at that stage , we have  UNK  communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
and there were rare but searing  UNK  of &quot;  UNK  &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking  UNK  to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with  UNK  to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
there was an energy there , an  UNK  optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .
she was back and near death .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
and when i listened to her , she was making a  UNK  sound .
when i think about creating abundance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of  UNK  microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
it &apos;s the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made of aluminum .
and every morning i hop on it .
so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not settle into a career in law .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the  UNK  of city hall .
we would never do that in our own countries .
huh . hang on a moment .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
a few years ago i started developing  UNK  .
and so i did .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
lego made it accessible .
do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft back towards the earth , in 1990 after it just passed saturn ?
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they  UNK  .
so what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
i made the decision to move to the u.s.
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
i &apos;m going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
it &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
but they do the job .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have  UNK  making ...
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
in many communities , people had to worry about being  UNK  .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted . &quot;
i sometimes push too hard .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in this  UNK  ? &quot;
and i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
they sell certificates .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to ted .
we &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got a.i. , you can cough on it , you can do a finger blood  UNK  .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about slavery .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
because the transition seems very , very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
and i went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and i hoped against hope that she would recover .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his throat .
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
he retreated into silence .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , froze the swiss bank account of mr. sam jain right here , and that bank account had  UNK  million u.s. dollars on it when it was frozen .
he types &quot; opossum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot;  UNK  cat ? &quot;
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
and i thought about that .
well i went into the  UNK  .
vicious cartels .  UNK  five :  UNK  cruise lines .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
instead of having to program , to wire , to  UNK  ,  UNK  allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have  UNK  us .
so how does it happen ?
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
this is my wifi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very  UNK  to me .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
now we talk about water wars .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
i ordered a kidney x-ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a  UNK  of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
i would like to talk to you about why many  UNK  projects fail .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about  UNK  .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have  UNK  of breath .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones .
hey , why not ?
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
one i thought had a kidney stone .
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
so we &apos;re the amoebas and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
thank you .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were  UNK  .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with this .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a  UNK  and opened another business .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleague universities , to help us to find and work and act like a hub to  UNK  all these  UNK  all around the world .
think about it , that a masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of kenya has better mobile  UNK  than president reagan did 25 years ago .
thank you .
i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an irresistible challenge .
and then my brother started staring at me .
we have the capital of the  UNK  .
we were poor .
i don &apos;t know .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
and it &apos;s that  UNK  connection that i believe  UNK  us to not just be attentive to all the bright and  UNK  things , but also the dark and difficult things .
and similar to &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to have just  UNK  up out of nowhere .
that means hit the ball into the  UNK  , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the runner was safe .
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
one of two things is going to happen .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
she took me out back and she said , &quot;  UNK  , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;
he is my grandfather .
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
and i memorized everything .
and the family gathered .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
and he knew her , he would have been able to  UNK  additional information about her .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
by being totally surprising and humorous , casey  UNK  got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my  UNK  and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
this is moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on ,  UNK  . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
and let me show you a simple example .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
i felt like anyone could do that .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
UNK  , creative participating communities , complete  UNK  , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
like here , we have mr.  UNK   UNK  from the city of kiev in ukraine .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail , in prison , on probation or parole .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal  UNK   UNK  .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
let me show you how they work .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exclusion , to  UNK  , to injustice .
at midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the  UNK  .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
and i got in my car and i went to this courthouse .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over  UNK  connections , so the local government can &apos;t  UNK  on their discussions .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mrs.  UNK  , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
and there they make great apps , they work with city  UNK  .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical  UNK  like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or  UNK  is supposed to bat .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
he died broken by history .
unlike the settled middle-class suburbs , whose existence i was oblivious of , there was no sense of entitlement in  UNK  .
well there are opportunities all around us .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
and i saw mrs.  UNK  , and she was  UNK  .
a lot of my clients are very young .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
but there are two problems with that .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
and issue rogue certificates .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle  UNK  in new york city , i admit i wasn &apos;t very interested .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total  UNK
and before i knew it , the  UNK  was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were  UNK  encouraged .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
and these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
yeah ,  UNK  , the judge has some magic power .
and the snippets of  UNK  english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
today , there are 2.3 million .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
all the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in english and mathematics was  UNK  for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secondhand .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4,000 followers on twitter .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
so i followed my hunches .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs.  UNK  .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
that could be shoveling out a hydrant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it .
thank you .
three months later i had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
the point is that the news media  UNK  feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the comeback trail .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness .
and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egyptian government a set of tools for  UNK  -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
and those are the neural structures .
that &apos;s why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the &apos; 70s .
it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed  UNK  report that &apos;s a response to the sec &apos;s request for comment on the financial reform bill .
but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
my state of alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently  UNK  you if you have a criminal conviction .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
this is bjorn  UNK  .
my name is brian goldman .
and i went through the same period of shame and  UNK  and felt  UNK  and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
but that &apos;s the nicest thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients .
and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
the chairman of coca-cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world .
so i spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
we &apos;ve also been taking  UNK  to design schools .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
the wealthiest  UNK   UNK  of the last century , the  UNK  on this planet , could have never dreamed of such luxuries .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
it connected those two people .
so what happened here ?
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
if there is a  UNK  in our family , it runs through the women .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
so here &apos;s another example .
thank you .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
because it &apos;s in that  UNK  that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
it would be so  UNK  and so empowering .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the  UNK  &apos;s .
last month , mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sunny parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted .
oh , my god .
the three words are : do you remember ?
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
she was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
he invited over to dinner the king of  UNK  .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
and that means  UNK  , it means open , it means generative .
and imagine if you would a.i. &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
and they will get healthier by using the  UNK  , and they &apos;ll become better educated by using the khan academy , and by literally being able to use 3d printing and infinite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
well in egypt , the  UNK  looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
how do i get this removed ? &quot;
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
it &apos;s not our burden .
i do get tired , as we all do .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
you see , scarcity is contextual , and technology is a  UNK  force .
and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
some of my  UNK  have been in the last five years .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
and his answer was yes .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
so given a dozen news stories , we will  UNK  look at the negative news .
i was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto when mrs.  UNK  was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where i was working .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
i am a redefined physician .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
we &apos;re trying to end life without parole sentences for children .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we  UNK  did .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
this is not a finished story .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
in the other , i was  UNK  in lives that were precarious , tragically scarred by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile  UNK  of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
the bricks are color-coded .
i met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was chosen as the young australian of the year .
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a  UNK  curve .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on  UNK  curves .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
i had written these crazy things .
thank you .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
we love technology . we love creativity .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
and that &apos;s nothing .
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
we have three main groups .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
so the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also  UNK  in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean .
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after mrs.  UNK  before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians i know dread .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some beer . &quot;
he said , &quot; oh , mama tells all the grandkids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
is it something about the details or the colors ?
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
groups like anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
and ms. parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her dearest friends , these older women ,  UNK   UNK  who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott -- amazing african american woman -- and virginia  UNK  , a white woman , whose husband , clifford  UNK  , represented dr. king .
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
you can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little  UNK  .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
privacy is implied .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
and i think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
so now we &apos;ve  UNK  up the time scales once again .
my male uncles died of  UNK  diseases .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
do you know what they call a 300  UNK  in major league baseball ?
it &apos;s not moving like that .
and many people forget this .
and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of  UNK  analogous to sex . &quot;
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; opossum in my trashcan . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
so that &apos;s  UNK  movement has done .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death penalty in germany .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
okay .
but if i could give it and still see them safely through , i would .
i was taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in melbourne .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of  UNK  will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
three times out of 10 .
in high school , a  UNK  once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve , on moore &apos;s law , and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
my mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pegged it at 100,000 .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
this is alfred  UNK  .
take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their  UNK  , and the children inherit the traits of the  UNK  of the two programs .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess ,  UNK  is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot;  UNK  , do you still feel me hugging you ? &quot;
i call it the rising billion .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
and on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
why did i go into medicine ?
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace corps for geeks .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday .  UNK  &apos; down on friday . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a  UNK  curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with  UNK  as a material .
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
think of this , in america today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television , mobile phones , air conditioning and cars .
yet i am afraid of privilege , of ease , of entitlement .
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant .
that whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collapses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . &quot;
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
if i had really been a  UNK  , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
all the adults knew the risks .
unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
good , really good , maybe an  UNK  .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
we know perfectly where all the atms are about the city of  UNK  .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
and then it went international .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the  UNK  , be perfect .
what will these people want ?
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a thief .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
we made an application for  UNK  , augmented reality , to find these  UNK  .
what about giving the oppressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a  UNK   UNK  canon ball .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
but it has an unexpected twist .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am ,  UNK  , almost a generation older than most of them .
why didn &apos;t i ask my attending ? why did i send her home ?
we &apos;ll just -- we can just skip -- i &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ...
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
there are billions of them .
steve pinker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance , but ultimately we knock them down .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
let me give you an example .
a school uniform down to the ankles , because it had to last for six years .
and there &apos;s good news here .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
to these  UNK  ,  UNK  became another material , electronics became just another material .
and i was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
go home to where ?
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
by 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion internet users .
i tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hugs .
and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , justin bieber , got his start on youtube .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the  UNK  voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
it could happen in learning time scales .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
but it does require a lot of planning .
privacy is not up for discussion .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
it was called the automatic binding brick .
or is it photography ?
this is a chart of what it looked like .
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world , it wasn &apos;t an mit professor , it wasn &apos;t a caltech student , it was a person from england , from manchester , a woman who , during the day , was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein folder .
so those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
and every now and then ms.  UNK  would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot;  UNK  , ms. parks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
and the next morning , i woke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
it &apos;s about the nuance of human language .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for  UNK  it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it 10 to the 22 times .
save those . kill off the rest .
now i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
and the conversation i had with dean kamen this morning , one of the great diy innovators , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what about contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
others in medicine dread them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so  UNK  .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
oh , my god !
i mean , how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm &apos;s watson ?
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
and the  UNK  staff pulled out all the stops .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
UNK  , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
no .
what do you do with certificates ?
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
we love entertainment .
so this is a story of napoleon iii in the  UNK  .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started  UNK  out .
but , but , you know what ?
among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an  UNK  , a  UNK  is supposed to be ?
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
now take the same patient with chest pain , make them moist and  UNK  and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath , and suddenly my history is  UNK  with contempt .
i was an obsessive compulsive student .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
but today , it goes beyond that .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the  UNK  .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
her mother raised her alone .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
so those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money ,  UNK  like anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
we work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage , where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous , causing havoc and death .
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a  UNK  throat .
two pairs of  UNK  for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
so that worked . so  UNK  for scott .
and if they &apos;re on a smartphone on google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did 15 years ago .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this holler .
and then we look at cases like what happened in  UNK  .
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; i will bypass you . &quot;
they sort of go like this .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
in this country , as many as 24,000 canadians die of preventable medical errors .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
and i was shocked and shaken to the core .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
famine in somalia . police pepper spray .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
cloud computing , what my friends at autodesk call infinite computing ; sensors and networks ; robotics ; 3d printing , which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vaccines and foods ; digital medicine ;  UNK  ; and a.i.
so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are  UNK  that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
but each time , they were gnawing at me , eating at me .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
and that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o  UNK  , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
she grew up at a time when  UNK  was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
and you make  UNK  and you never make that mistake again .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours ms. parks turned to me and she said , &quot; now  UNK  , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
we &apos;ve been giving  UNK  to kids and seeing them play with them .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
we &apos;re taking off .
if we were captured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of  UNK  doctors .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source -- saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- at less than two cents a liter .
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
goodnight sweet opossum . &quot;
he was placed on  UNK  antibiotics and he recovered after a few days .
it &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100  UNK  of white powder , which i try not to let the security people see at airports .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
we have seven million people on probation and parole .
last year , bear  UNK  posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
it &apos;s not about being scarce , it &apos;s about accessibility .
in the 1980s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
there were remixes .
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
the one thing i &apos;ve learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past .
here i have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
it &apos;s true .
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
two years later i was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of toronto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat .
we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
this is stephen watt .
jeopardy &apos;s not an easy game .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
and their pupils would dilate , they would  UNK  , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d assault me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so confusing .
thank you .
and then it happened again .
the only country in the world .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
i began to feel a bit better .
and if that  UNK  out , which i have every confidence it will , coca-cola will deploy this globally to  UNK  countries around the planet .
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this  UNK  to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .
but i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to admit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
all of napoleon &apos;s troops were fed with silver  UNK  , napoleon himself with gold  UNK  .
it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
but i carried on with my work .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the  UNK  of your province .
he &apos;s the dude on the left .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
and we say that word with such contempt .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named erik  UNK  , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this  UNK  of beer -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qualifications .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her .
suppose you have  UNK  and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s batting 400 on  UNK  .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment .
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
it &apos;s all bound by oxygen and  UNK  .
in my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything i can , from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
&quot; moneyball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; if it  UNK  it leads , &quot; is very true .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
no had never been an option .
last month , i had the pleasure of announcing with  UNK  foundation something called the $ 10 million  UNK   UNK  x prize .
jimmy  UNK  posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
and now there are 10,000  UNK  of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
at the time i was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation .
wealth , not  UNK  , shapes outcomes .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 911 and the  UNK  brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
we think about energy scarcity .
because  UNK  like jimmy  UNK  introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
i don &apos;t take the same history .
in fact , i  UNK  the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could .
and if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .
there &apos;s a guy in the i.t. department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
and over 10,000  UNK  already in the netherlands already have been submitted .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
i was riding in a 747 with marvin minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
and i made myself a bargain that if only i  UNK  my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the  UNK  hack .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
and you saw  UNK  &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the  UNK  program right before your eyes .
i think it &apos;s very  UNK  of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
i looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
and charles kenny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
i &apos;m sitting here making grunting sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .
i never will forget it .
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in  UNK  with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
a few weeks ago we took  UNK  to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot;
but so many over the years were helped .
on my show , on &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; i made it a habit of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from  UNK  to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about yours ? &quot; and i would point the microphone towards them .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
i talk a lot about these issues .
because we live on a water planet .
so beyond simple play ,  UNK  are actually pretty powerful .
and i went back to work .
you see , even though aluminum is  UNK  percent of the earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the  UNK  coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
but then the technology of  UNK  came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with  UNK  mentality .
