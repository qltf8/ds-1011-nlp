how can i tell you 10 minutes of talking about the woman who three generations , how passionate about how powerful , is astonishing , her life is made of life with her baby &apos;s daughter , and her sister &apos;s daughter with her sister &apos;s lap with her sister &apos;s lap with her sister &apos;s lap and his father &apos;s daughter -- and in her lap and his father &apos;s daughter , and his life in her life , and his  UNK  , and his past 20 years -- and his life in the coffee -- and his
this story is unprecedented .
it &apos;s a game installation .
let me tell you a few samples .
imagine the first one : the man
he was the poet poet , he wrote a playwright , a  UNK  salesman in his life that the universe was independent .
imagine imagine , a communist member of the  UNK  , facing the fact that his life was  UNK  .
words , over the last few months , you &apos;re  UNK  with him .
he walked away .
he passed away , historically .
he was my grandfather .
i &apos;ve never met him .
but our lives are much more valuable than memories in memories .
my grandmother never allowed me to forget his life .
my task is not for my life in my life , and the lessons i realize is that , well , we have history , but we &apos;ve been dismantled .
the next sheet of the puzzle is an early stage in the roof of the sea .
my mother , , when she 18 18 years old -- lost his family , a marriage arranged , had two little girls .
with my mother , my father &apos;s focused on the mission : the family was able to lobby and reclaim life in australia .
she never meant to be successful .
so after the four years , a  UNK  more than in the , , boats ship boats ship boats .
all the adults knows the risk .
it was the biggest terror of israel , rape and death .
like many adults on the boat , i brought a tiny little bottles .
if we were left , we were first elated , and my mum , and i would marry her .
the earliest earliest moments i remember is from the boat -- an english engine , rode the sink of the boat .
i &apos;m not going to steal a rock to a lot of times , but it took away from the use of the  UNK  man , or when the train was going to die and died after the end of the day .
but i remember him went from to the abandoned yards away and a british russian falls , and the death of the journey was facing me , and he passed me through the first one , and i was able to create the  UNK  , the ,  UNK  , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  UNK  , , , , , , , , ,  UNK  , , , , , , , , , ,  UNK  , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
there is no such thing .
after three months in refugee camps , we went to bali .
and the next piece of cartoons is the four woman , three generations of life .
we settled in the suburbs of the suburbs , for the suburbs . dan protected those numbers .
it &apos;s not typical suburbia .
the smell comes from from the world around the world .
and the shepherd is  UNK  in conversation between the people who have one common ground , they &apos;re starting from the beginning .
my mother worked in the farm , and in the production line , a week , a week after week , the two days .
and my mother still had time and english information .
we are very poor .
it used to spend the amount of money , and in addition to the hours and total all of his own possessions , except if you had to pay them , it would be  UNK  clothing , clothes , we were all the time .
two thousand things go to school , learn to wait to life on the other side .
my father &apos;s long uniform , because it had to go to the year .
sometimes , thanks to the white house , &quot;  UNK  &quot; and sometimes notes on the wall : &quot; the  UNK  , &quot;
where ? housing ?
there &apos;s a little bit in me .
our support and a voice says , &quot; i &apos;m going to walk through . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i sleep on a bed .
my mother came out , but we told stories in listening to the day and she heard me around the house .
my mother had a nightmare .
my mission is to be a nightmare when my daughter is blamed .
my mother opened my computer and a philosophy of art and other business fan .
and the woman told women to tell their stories about men and women who couldn &apos;t fit into their lives , and  UNK  , and the babies between the two worlds of the world .
we &apos;ve funded the relief and the sponsors .
the centers are founded .
i live in two parallel world .
in a world , my world is a conservative view .
in the world , i have covered in pieces of starvation ,  UNK  injuries , and  UNK  .
but it was too many years years .
and since then , when i was a law student , i was recruited by the youth .
and i was shoved from this piece of pieces in this puzzle , and they didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous  UNK  in the united states , now , refugee camps , and social , every disadvantaged , never spoke to places anywhere i have never seen before .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know how to use .
i don &apos;t know about wine .
i &apos;m not talking about anything .
i want to get the daily guidance of the daily and the pleasant life in a suburban lifestyle -- and three people , and the mother end up their day like the day , for 20 years , listen to each other day .
i told my mother was impossible .
my mother is now my father at the age of time .
it &apos;s not like a choice .
&quot; go ahead , &quot; my mum said , &quot; and i became a different person . &quot;
so i &apos;m talking about youth unemployment and unemployment , and people are attracted to society .
and i said , honestly , i can get a lot .
i met people from society from society , a lot of people who live in love , they live in their survival .
and although i graduated from risd , i realized that i couldn &apos;t believe in the law .
this picture requires a piece of furniture .
and at the same time i realized that the  UNK  was told , everybody came to each other , and -- and not just one thing , but a thing that we need to be grateful for a gift .
because it &apos;s standing up in the easy body , easy to lose the visibility , you can easily get the benefits of stereotypes in your region .
now i &apos;ve come out of the safe &apos; apartment , to tell you , sure , the world can break the break .
but the potential possibilities is not going to allow to incentivize .
there &apos;s an energy source , it &apos;s a optimistic  UNK  , a combination of weird and humility .
so i went through my own notebook .
i collected a little team with us , &quot; no , &quot; is a very audacious challenge .
for a year we don &apos;t a penny .
all day , i &apos;m going to do a giant soup to eat .
we worked at night .
most of our ideas ideas were crazy , but some ideas were great ideas , and we created a breakthrough .
i decided to see the u.s. u.s. u.s.
then there &apos;s a trip .
have a hunch .
three months later , and i moved on to adventure .
before i finish , let me tell you about three .
she grew up in the middle age of the standard  UNK  , which is the  UNK  and the  UNK  .
life is in such a century .
she three days after days after three days .
my mother was raised alone .
in the age of 17 , she became became a benign , a boy bin laden .
and so oil has not been supported by the fighting of her husband , against the case of trial to sue court , and after 9 / 11 , and the concussion was caused by three months after ants .
&quot; not being done . &quot;
i &apos;m in a shower in the hotel room at three months of 600 miles of 600 yards , in melbourne .
and i looked through eight and  UNK  , right there .
i know she wanted to to me .
a few minutes after dinner .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist buddhist buddhist monastery and sat around the world .
we tell three and three dollars with three suggestions that we &apos;ve always been on .
at midnight , and he told us to be  UNK  .
she told us how she felt her hands .
my mother asked me , &quot; why am i with my mother ? &quot;
&quot; because the light from the  UNK  hand , &quot; he said .
&quot; not just  UNK  . &quot;
if there is a resource in our family , we passed through the women .
because we are and how we define our lives , and now we can see that the men that people could have walked into our lives .
failure will be easy to lose .
now i want to have kids , and i was wondering about the boat .
anyone who wants their kids ?
but i feared the fear , the fear of life ,  UNK  .
could i tell me a  UNK  in my life , a lot of birds in life ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  of  UNK  ,
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could show that and i still feel calm , i would pass my dog .
and she &apos;s mother &apos;s day today , here in the fourth room or fourth .
it was honored to be when i stand here and share with people .
i had to go through a long time from prison , and prisons in prison prisons were convicted of death .
i also had a long time to live a long time in the middle of eastern communities with low income and projects .
and i came here to me and encourage him to listen to me about this : the more i gave you to give me a lot more .
and one of the most striking things that i realized that i was in was short time here was a tedtalk .
and you can talk about a lot of things that have influenced all over the world .
and sometimes you get to ted power and get power to you if you &apos;re not going to get power .
and i mentioned this because i think the identity is really important .
we &apos;ve got some great speech talks .
and i think what we found was , if you were teachers , the words of the word you would have meaning in what if you were a rich teachers , your protagonist .
and if you &apos;re a doctor , you can do some good things , if you &apos;re a doctor , you can do another thing .
that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
in fact , i didn &apos;t learn this when i was lawyers or lawyers .
i actually learned this from her grandmother .
i grew up in a house , a nigerian family and traditional  UNK  and my grandmother .
she &apos;s very strong , powerful and powerful in the family .
she was always on a  UNK  .
and it &apos;s always a lot of  UNK  .
she mother actually was a slave .
my parents were born in  UNK  in  UNK  .
and she was born in 1991 , and she had to go back to the  UNK  of slaves , that &apos;s what she looked at her life .
she did , but also the  UNK  .
when i was in school , when i looked at her three and she &apos;s going to get sick into my lap .
she was clinging to me so that i couldn &apos;t breath afterwards .
one or two hours later , if i met her three , and she said , &quot; oh , you know , &quot; oh my gosh , you feel like i &apos;m sick . &quot;
and if i say , &quot; no , i &apos;m not going to attack my attack and i say say , &quot; i say , &quot; i have my skin , &quot; i have her skin . &quot;
three of a character that you will always want to be near .
the only challenge was three .
my mother is  UNK  .
sometimes , i went to and up to my grandmother &apos;s very hard to care .
my  UNK  around me around three places .
and i remember that , when i was about eight , nine , i had a morning , i woke up to the morning , i was zoomed in my living rooms , and i would see all the neighborhoods around the room , around the dining room , around the dining room , around the room around the dining room .
she was sitting behind me .
at the moment , i thought we were playing a game game .
so i looked at her smile and laughed at very severe .
fifteen , 20 20 minutes , don &apos;t have come up with three rooms , and i talk . &quot;
i remember prototyping that day , as it was too late .
and i &apos;ll never forget .
and she led me out of the room , and then she said , &quot; hey , you &apos;re going to talk to you about the one who told you . &quot;
i said , &quot; it &apos;s skin . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , surely surely i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
and she sat down , and i looked at her and she said , &quot; she wanted to know that she was still floating in my legs . &quot;
i thought she was special kids . &quot;
&quot; i think you can do everything you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget her .
and she said , &quot; i &apos;m just going to promise you with three things , three . &quot;
i said , &quot; skin is tone-deaf . &quot;
&quot; the first thing i &apos;d like to promise . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a baby girl &apos;s daughter , and i &apos;ll promise that that you will always raise your care . &quot;
well , i love my mum , so i promise , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
&quot; the third thing i want to promise . i &apos;m always going to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; oh yeah , i &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
and she said , &quot; three things that are three or three things that i promise . i &apos;m not going to take a baby . &quot;
well , at that time i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; well , i promise . &quot;
i grew up in my southern hemisphere and my big brother , and my older brother is a little girl , and i remember my little older sister .
when i was 14 , 15 years old , a day i was about home and i brought about a  UNK  bottle i didn &apos;t know he had his name from her head and she would pull me into the woods and she walked into the woods .
the great  UNK  we &apos;re out there .
he took a drink of beer , and gave my baby and gave me a notebook .
i said , &quot; no , no . it &apos;s not just going to take your hands . you &apos;re going to drink a beer . &quot;
he left , i said , &quot; well , we do this work today , and you &apos;re always doing everything and you &apos;ve done . &quot;
you &apos;ve got a little bit of little sister , i &apos;ve got a little girl , and i &apos;ve got a little girl .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel like i &apos;m standing . you don &apos;t have two old days , go ahead , go ahead . &quot;
and i &apos;m staring at me staring staring staring at me .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m
he &apos;s looking at me , &quot; oh , i &apos;m hoping you &apos;re not going to talk a lot about my talk . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you saying ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; tell me all of these girls that they &apos;re especially special . &quot;
now , i was disappointed disappointed disappointed .
i want to to confession you with confession .
i &apos;m worried that i should not say .
i know that this conversation will be broadcast .
but i &apos;m still going to say , i &apos;m a 52 and i admit that i &apos;ve never had a alcohol .
i &apos;m not telling me because i think the right thing is , is moral ; i want to talk to the human spirit .
when we create a real world where we can talk to things around the world around us , what they don &apos;t really believe .
we can make them make them doing things without thinking that they don &apos;t .
and when she thinks of of her grandmother , i know that she thinks that all of these children are especially .
my grandfather had been from the cooking  UNK  and sold alcohol .
i &apos;m dying by the virus .
and of course she thinks of what we need to do .
and i &apos;ve been talking to the justice of justice justice .
national countries , it has a lot of times 40 years ago .
in 1972 , there were from 300,000 prisoners .
today , that &apos;s coming up with 2.3 million .
the united states now has the highest concentration in the world .
and there &apos;s seven million people or  UNK   UNK  .
in this case , i was a  UNK  that was fundamentally changed the world .
for those poor people , the consequences of this meant that they had to disappoint them with strangers .
in three months old men from 18 to 30 , there is a prison in prison .
in medieval cities in this country like los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington , d.c. in washington trying to get 50 percent of the people in the state of the situation , in the same state , they get burned , or  UNK  or drop .
the system of our legal system is not just defined by the way , but it &apos;s not  UNK  by the gulf of iran .
we &apos;re having a lot of justice system that will be willing to treat you better than if you poor rich are poor parents .
it &apos;s rich , it &apos;s not what i have .
even though , we seem to feel uncomfortable about this .
we fear and anger and angst for us to believe that this is not what we have to worry .
so we isolate isolate isolate isolate isolate isolate isolate isolate isolate isolate isolate .
but this brings me to care .
we &apos;re seeing a development of interesting jobs in our jobs .
i live in the ice , like alabama , but it &apos;s actually going to be the right you of criminal justice if you
right now , in alabama , there is  UNK  percent .
we anticipated that we &apos;re 10 years 10 years later on the right of citizens to have access to the as soon as if elections passed through the act of legislation .
and there was silence .
i want to show up the voice for children .
a lot of different remains still remains .
america was the only country in the world of a child who was 13 years old .
do you do your life .
we &apos;re actually taking a bunch of babies .
and the only one in the world is doing this .
i &apos;d like to speak up for suicide suicide suicide suicide .
he was asked to death . this was very interesting .
in many ways , we are taught to believe that question is whether people are dying , because they have killed that causes ?
this is a very practical question .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about ourselves in our heads .
another way of thinking about this is not whether or i have a  UNK  or whether or not whether or not to kill us ?
i mean , it was incredible !
eat death in the united states defined defined .
and nine were killed from us to find a innocent guy and  UNK  suicide suicide .
this is a terrible amount of terrible errors in prison , who was convicted of innocent people convicted innocent .
it &apos;s incredible hard .
in the astronaut industry , we &apos;re never going to walk to the old nine if take off the planes that take off the planes .
but somehow , we throw ourselves away from this problem .
see , it &apos;s not our problems .
not the burden of our burden .
and that &apos;s not what we need to fight .
i talk a lot about these problems .
race and race about whether we deserve deserve .
and what &apos;s interesting is that when i teach my students about the history of americans to tell me about the slavery , they &apos;ve slavery .
terrorism is starting at the end of the end of  UNK  and reform to world war ii .
we actually don &apos;t know about this .
but for the united states in the country , it &apos;s a terrible .
a lot of people were afraid .
they were frightened of bombs bombs .
and that is the threat of terrorism .
those people came and said to me , &quot; mr.  UNK  , he talks to talk , but speech talk to each other &apos;s best talk to the history of the 9 / 11 .
let &apos;s say telling them that we have to grow with that .
and of course , of course , terrorism is a distinction between ethnic and ethnic racial  UNK  and apartheid .
we see see the exact fact that we don &apos;t want to about ourselves .
we don &apos;t want to talk about history history .
and therefore , we didn &apos;t understand what it means .
we &apos;re not conflict conflicting conflict .
not stopping .
we &apos;ve been doing hard to talk about race , i firmly believe that we are not willing to accept truth and reconciliation and reconciliation .
in south africa , they know that they can &apos;t resist the diet to commit suicide to the truth and the flower .
in rwanda , even after the bad genocide , there was a commitment to this country , but we haven &apos;t done it .
i had several lawyers in germany .
in fact , by the essay of my speech , i stand up and stand up and say , &quot; i &apos;m actually really happy when i hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
&quot; in germany , there is no death penalty .
and of course , we will never have a  UNK  sentence in germany . &quot;
we needed to become a woman . she said , &quot; in our history in history , we never get involved in a system .
it &apos;s impossible to do or inadvertently  UNK  , or whoever doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;
and i thought about this .
you &apos;ll feel like if you live in a world where the german cow eats , as it is due to the russians .
i cannot ignore it .
so through  UNK  through  UNK  .
in our country , in southern southern southern hemisphere , people sentenced to eat the death penalty , which is a high dose of death penalty due to the white family .
and therefore , there is a word
i think our personalities are dying .
when we don &apos;t really care about tough things , but it &apos;s good .
we like innovate .
love , love technology .
like entertainment .
but eventually , in fact , it &apos;s due to  UNK  ,  UNK  , ptsd and moral .
for me , the combination of two things actually is essential necessary .
since we &apos;re talking about the more hope to endeavor more and more and more and more challenges than to challenges the challenges in the world challenges , in this complex world complexity in complexity .
for me , it meant meant time to think , to talk about poor people , poor people , difficult difficulty .
however , let &apos;s think about their way with our lives .
you know , then eventually we have to believe what we &apos;ve never seen before .
yes .
innovation , innovation and development , there &apos;s not just the idea in our ideas .
it comes from the ideas of ideas .
and that &apos;s the connection of our minds and hearts , and what i believe is that it &apos;s not only exciting .
UNK   UNK  , a great leader , said about this .
&quot; when we were in eastern europe , with regard to the oppression that we wanted to have all the things that we need in a spiritual manner .
in fact , what is the essence of my beliefs , just like the ted community .
there &apos;s a disconnect between technology and design allows us to show when we really pay attention to the poverty , it &apos;s not paying attention to the rights and injustice .
now let me warn you to have that kind of thing that we have experienced so much when we don &apos;t pay attention to the challenge .
that &apos;s what happened .
i had a privileged privilege , when i was a lawyer , i met had  UNK  park .
she wanted to go to a lot of times and she walked with her two brothers and my friends in front of them ,  UNK   UNK  , who was run on the board campaign on the board of the united states of the united states of south america , and the united states of women , a jewish group of women , a jewish group of women , a jewish group of women , a jewish group of lawyers , a king , named women &apos;s representatives , the king of san francisco , the king of san francisco
these women are  UNK  .
so every time , she would call it  UNK  and say , &quot; hey , park in the park , she &apos;s going to town town and we &apos;re going to come together .
do you want to hear ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
she said , &quot; what are you going to make ?
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and then i went there , and i would listen to listen .
this actually has accelerated innovation .
there was a time i went to hear and listened to them in a park , and they spoke to the park , and i said , &quot; aww , let &apos;s say , let me tell you about javascript or a fair idea of justice .
and what he was doing .
so i started talking about  UNK  .
&quot; oh , we are changing injustice .
we &apos;re trying to help people convicted of convicted , convicted .
trying to with biased and biased to the distinction in justice in justice .
try to end up children with convicted of life without  UNK  ,  UNK  .
trying to do something about death penalty , death penalty .
a lot less than men , imprisoned , imprisoned .
and ending stop  UNK  . &quot;
when i talk to my  UNK  , she said , &quot; um , um , um , um , um . um .
&quot; that &apos;s going to get tired fatigue .
and that &apos;s the third force ,  UNK   UNK  , put my hands up , and i said , &quot; you should have to be courageous and brave brave brave brave brave brave brave brave brave brave brave brave brave brave .
i actually think that the ted community needs to be bold .
we need to find ways of dealing with challenges , and it &apos;s difficult to injustice inequality .
because in all , we all have to rely on this planet .
i had learned very simple things when i work on my job .
it &apos;s only taught me very simple .
and i do understand and believe that every day we have to do better than we do .
i believe that true for everyone on this planet .
i think if anyone lie , they &apos;re not lying .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t have their own property , not just a steal .
i suppose , when you only kill somebody , you &apos;re not a skeptic .
and therefore , humanity has a fundamental dignity that has to be french .
i also believe that in many places in this country , and of course , is also a lot of the world in the world , the poorest of poverty is not rich .
i don &apos;t believe .
i actually think that a lot of places with poor is poverty .
and finally , i believe that even the fact that this is really great , and it &apos;s exciting and exciting , but we &apos;re not going to be driven by our technology by design by our minds , because by definition and ideal , because and ideal , ideal and ideal .
and you don &apos;t make a society by society and they treat with people , rich and power and people who are represented by the way that they have to deal with them , poor people , poor people , poor people .
because it &apos;s the consequence of what we started looking at us .
sometimes , when i lose my balance , i would end up with this story .
sometimes sometimes i have too much .
i &apos;m actually pretty close , it &apos;s just like everyone .
it &apos;s kind of like the old ideas that appear to think about our thoughts .
and i &apos;ve been representing surveys for children who are very severely .
i came from myself to my father , that was only 14 years 13 years old , and he was allowed to stand up like a building .
i started thinking , how did this happen ?
how can judge you a turn into a friend ?
judge russell was an adult , but i saw him a kid .
and there &apos;s a night , i &apos;m very , and and and , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , if you you you you
well ,  UNK  , judge judge , as powerful .
so i should ask you a little bit .
and since midnight , i &apos;m not really thinking , so i started to write a petition for a petition .
that i had a new daughter , and she was black .
i started to work with this with a couple of medals called the  UNK  girl who tried to get a child in a black ugandan , like a white group , like secretary ,  UNK  , 75 years old .
i &apos;m presenting a petition that has mistaken mistaken for the wrong problem of police , and the police .
there is a crazy idea of how it is without the right side of this country .
the next morning , i woke up thinking , and i thought i was going to have a crazy idea or a crazy idea that i &apos;ve done it ?
in my panic , not only did i write it , but i had sent it to the court .
a few months later , i &apos;m familiar with this .
and finally i decided i decided to go to the court court and find this case .
i walked in the car , in the very , very felt
i was in the car and then went to court .
now i thought it was difficult .
and finally , i finally came out of the car , into the court .
and when i walked up the stairs in front of a black ugandan man , i was a german officer .
when this man , i saw him , and i said , &quot; who is him ? &quot;
i said , &quot; am i lawyers . &quot;
and he gets closer and closer .
and in my visit , i &apos;m in .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to tell you that that led to me .
it has a deeply profound implications in the human part of human personality , and my contribution to contribute to the human community , for community , hoping to hope .
i came in the room , rooms .
and when i walked into the judges , i saw the judge to see my judges .
he said , &quot;  UNK  , have you have to write a petition on this crazy flaw ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot; and we started to argue .
people turned into the room because they were very angry .
and i wrote these things crazy .
the director and the director .
and before i went to the room , the invasion of  UNK  and people were supposed to be talking about race , about poverty , poverty and poverty , and injustice .
and although i &apos;m not standing in front of me , but i can see the  UNK  steps .
he always looked through the window , and he heard screaming screaming screaming yelling screaming .
he walked away .
he walked into the room and he was behind me .
10 minutes later when you break a photo note .
gravity wins ,  UNK   UNK  , he was attacked by the guards .
he jumped his group to the guard guard guard .
and he says , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and the black guy came up to stand up and look at the street , and then he turned to the light and he said to me , he said , &quot; i &apos;m here in this young woman , and let &apos;s focus on this question of justice for justice . &quot;
i went to ted because because i believe that many people in the experience you understand is the moral code in life , it &apos;s about it , but for it , for justice .
knowing that we can &apos;t really do to people when we care about human rights and human rights .
that our survival is associated with attachment .
and our vision of our technology about technology and design , entertainment and has always been hiding with the vision of community .
above all , with this , i just simply talk to you that your goals is to pursue your goals or goals , or go .
thank you very much .
so he heard and saw the audience of the audience , because the ted community to help him his home on the road and you can do something to this .
instead of just money , what can we save ?
well , there is ample opportunities around us .
for example , if you live in california , in this spring , there will be a referendum that was going to be here , we &apos;re trying to navigate with a joint amount of money .
for instance , we &apos;re going to have a million dollars dollars a for five dollars of a year , and a million dollars .
and 46 percent of the population is not killed .
it &apos;s 56 / 11 .
so we have a chance to change the situation .
and so this process is going to a referendum to make a petition and reassure of justice .
and i think that opportunities is always around us .
united states has lost a lot of decades in the decades .
and part of that story is sometimes it takes time .
what would you do with those who believe ?
in fact , crime is violence .
the  UNK  rates in the united states grew up in the country is actually not violence .
this is a fight fight .
and the number of  UNK  people grew up significantly .
and we lost lost control , against the limits of the punishment .
and therefore , we have three sons against people because it &apos;s stealing a bicycle or three-quarters of stealing , rather than three-quarters of what they &apos;re paying for their assets .
i believe that we need to do more and more to help people to get aids into a prison that is not not a  UNK  .
i think the  UNK   UNK  of our present is inadequate help .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
UNK  , he actually hit the psychological .
you &apos;re actually a inspiration .
thank you very much to ted . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk a little idea .
on the rise of the road .
and that idea was able to explain to a minute in a minute . i &apos;m going to tell you three stories in front of the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
he came here in the  UNK  years as you know very well .
and you thought he was going to come to the mountain .
he actually collected the bees .
he was describing one of them . &quot;
this is the  UNK  butterfly .
a large chunk of this mining industry is being documented in the &apos; 80s .
now this whole mushroom is in the red line .
this story . we &apos;ve heard a lot of times in the galapagos and other places .
but the point is , we still go to the galapagos .
we still think it &apos;s  UNK  .
the  UNK  are still protecting them .
so what happens here ?
the second story , the valve is to give a notion of something called the flow of the curve .
at the end of that came in in the study of saint  UNK  .
i went there because i grew up europe in africa and i wanted to that later later in africa africa .
although i was able to fit in life .
i have a my sister who has attempted a girl who was really not really coming from it .
this is my first  UNK  .
UNK  was surrounded by the trees , you can see some trees .
there is estimation or 20 kilos of africa , with  UNK  with a  UNK  called  UNK  .
the  UNK  sector  UNK  ban this fee to be able to rebound , and they actually have a pretty profitable rate of income in europe .
and after years after i returned to the size , the size of this fish is only half .
they arrive at age 13 .
there was a genetic impact on this whole raft .
there is a lot of fish .
they &apos;re still very shy .
and these species are kind of uncomfortable in the same .
so there &apos;s nothing changed , but everything changed .
the third story of me is that when i &apos;m in the shipyard who deals with the trees in the himalayas .
in the &apos; 70s -- &apos; oh , it &apos;s not the &apos; 60s . &apos; europe &apos; europe -- a lot of work projects developed projects .
development industry meant meant that they could have contributed to countries countries that have been 100,000 to 100,000 tons of fishing agents on  UNK  fishing .
and this one , these bad guys are called  UNK  .
i use it to study surveys in the southern area of the southern province of china and china and especially  UNK  .
what we we , we don &apos;t seek out from it .
what we have now , i learned that this is sea .
the 90 percent of what we hit was  UNK  , and different creatures lived underwater underwater underwater .
and most of these species are very small ones that are  UNK  , but in the form of debris , or the  UNK  , the swarms of fish , coral reefs live in the reef .
the key thing is the ballast sea that keeps the boat and then turned back into the back .
but this picture is an incredible imagination , because this accelerated shift has accelerated quickly .
in a year , you do a survey , and then running national mall .
it turns out that this compound in this situation is from the beach sea , or the coral reef .
this is a dead sea dead .
these kinds of legs were not stopped , they were thrown away because they died died died .
one day we got to be alive .
it &apos;s still not  UNK  .
so they wanted to kill it .
the mountain ridge was actually collected by the fishermen , and they go away in the ocean that they had never been before .
but this is not recognized by the document .
we transform transforming the world we don &apos;t remember this .
we adjust our  UNK  lane on a new level that we &apos;ve never been dived before .
if you generalize this combination , something like this is going to happen .
we have some good data from the axis of biodiversity , of course , the origin of biodiversity , the size of the united states of the country .
over time , it &apos;s going to change it -- it changes what it is .
each generation &apos;s going to use those images that they have from original compassion as a standard , and that &apos;s going to
and then the difference is that they perceive that as a loss .
but they didn &apos;t realize anything happened before it was a loss .
you can do a lot of change after changes .
ultimately , you want to maintain the other poor .
and that , with this larger scale , is what we want to do .
we want to keep building things anymore . but not just like before .
people think that this poses the problem affects people to be so sure in society , and they kill animals and they don &apos;t know what they did before .
because , obviously , a creature with a number of abundance , before it became extinct .
so you don &apos;t take away with animals .
you &apos;re losing animals .
so they &apos;re not considered a loss .
over time we &apos;re focusing on animals , we focused on these big fish .
they became increasingly scarce , because we were prosecuted .
over time we &apos;re very small , and we think this is  UNK  road .
the question is , how do you accept accept this ?
just because they didn &apos;t know it was different .
in fact , many people , and scientists have said that it was very different .
they &apos;re going to argue this because they &apos;ve been shown before in the early case , they don &apos;t want to pick it up .
for example , the story was a couple of people told us about captain watching captain watching a lot of fish fish in the vicinity of fish that couldn &apos;t afford to eat or not as much as the  UNK  of scientists because the science of the animal kingdom has been hearing for any scientific industry .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know if even though they are alive in society .
and as a result , the big part of the marine protected is able to contribute .
because with the marine conservation protected , we &apos;re actually generating the past .
we replace the past that the past people cannot perceive it , and it &apos;s been constrained at the low level .
that &apos;s the people who can see see protected protected and protect from the insight from understanding that it comes to the things that can make them their way .
so what can &apos;t you do it ? because they don &apos;t have access to the intersection of people -- not in the hands of the hands ?
i think is the art art , and maybe art can be transformed , and visualization .
this is the gulf of the gulf .
it &apos;s very long ago in the bay of  UNK  , and 500 years ago .
you might notice the color and color sound like &quot; avatar . &quot;
and if you think about the film &quot; &apos; &quot; if you think about about how it has gotten blows how people can come together -- don &apos;t pay attention to the story of why -- so why people are so excited by why they are too scary to the  UNK  .
because it provoked something about it .
and so my suggestion was to me , this is the only thing that i wanted to show the director of the director for the second &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
do you know how many do you make choices in one day ?
do you know how many do you make choices in a week ?
recently , i &apos;ve been more closely than 2,000 people in the united states , and the average american choices that americans have been seen about 70 days per day .
there was done extensive conducted with the ceos that we were ceo with a week ceo .
and the scientists took all of different missions tasks that they serve , and they took a lot of time to spend a lot of tasks to make decisions passing into tasks tasks tasks .
and they found out that the average was ceo was a  UNK  ceo of a week task .
of course , mission is included a lot of small options .
50 percent of the &apos;s decisions about nine or less or less
and about 12 percent of the 12 decisions that they actually perform in one or more .
now , thinking about the choices of your own choices .
how many of you have lost the choice in between 10 minutes ?
do you think about how good management manager ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest problems of choices that we are much more choices with choices .
i want to talk about the issues and issues that are addressing the way .
and when i talk about this , i &apos;m going to ask for a couple of puzzles and i hope you know the answer .
so when i asked you ask a question of what i &apos;d like to see , if you want to burn a weight , you need to raise your hands .
if not , when i ask , ask , and if you ask the answer , you &apos;re happy , yeah .
now the first question of today &apos;s day , you &apos;re willing to hear about choice ?
thank you .
when i graduated graduate student from stanford university , i used to have a lot of grocery stores , that time , i was pretty rich .
this is a  UNK  called  UNK  .
now it &apos;s almost like a park park .
they &apos;ve got trillions of different types of different types of different sauces and they &apos;re more different from each other , and they &apos;re more different than two dozen different countries .
i &apos;d like to look at this store , but naturally , i &apos;ve asked myself how to come and you can &apos;t buy something ?
this is the  UNK  of oil .
they have more than 75 different varieties of different varieties , including including the locked in prison to the  UNK   UNK  .
so , one day , i decided to ask for the manager , and asked me , &quot; how do i invite people to make these effective choices ? &quot;
and he showed the crowd of travel travel on every day , the camera went back regularly .
we decided to do a small experiment , and we pulled ourselves .
this is your  UNK  jars .
they have more  UNK  than others .
we opened up a little letter back to the store of the store .
we have six to five different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different smells , and we identified two things : one thing : what &apos;s in the test , everyone wants to  UNK  , whatever it takes ?
a lot of people stopped , between 60 percent when we came out of 24 species , and then only six years , there &apos;s only 40 percent .
the next thing we found was in the case of everybody bought a bottle .
now we see the opposite effect .
and amongst other people stopped taking us 24 hours , only three percent of them bought them .
and amongst other people stopped using  UNK  , and we were suddenly afraid to see that when we saw 30 percent of the  UNK  buy .
now , try to do math at least 10 times as many people want to buy a bottle of them when they see six of them .
now you can &apos;t choose choose to buy a better bottle for the last few years better than we will be better for our  UNK  than we may have pointed out in the problem .
we chose not choose even when it comes to the other side of the good things that we just do .
the theme today will continue to show you financial financial crisis .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you a lesson with a  UNK  lesson with with  UNK   UNK  , with  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , , licklider , of , , , , , , , , , , , to a quarter million u.s. dollars
and what we see is whether the number of resources available resources to save our planning plans to influence .
and what we discovered is that there &apos;s an association correlation .
so in those plans , we had a  UNK  plans to volunteer people from people to go from different sources .
and we found that the more we actually get it , actually less , less less .
so if you look closer to the plan that you &apos;ve funded for the two decades of finance in the middle of the 1970s , but we don &apos;t want to .
in the lower funding financial donors .
now , it shows that even when you choose to have more access to the existing choices , even the negative impacts negative consequences .
for those who chooses to choose more choice , the more people get involved .
more and more choices than all of their money into financial markets .
now it &apos;s not the weak choice but who chooses to any of us who chooses to tell us when people consider to consider this financial citizen for their financial services .
over the past decade in our past , we witnessed the three negative consequences for every human choice .
they prefer to delay choice .
they seem to be more bad choices than worse in financial health .
they seem to choose not to be less happy about them when they &apos;re better to perform better .
the main reason why this is because we could look look at the big picture of the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the  UNK  , the , of , , of , , , , and surprising and surprising and surprising
so what i &apos;d like to ask you to do today is with simple technologies that we &apos;ve tested several years in many ways that you can apply to you in your business .
first : cuts cutting .
you &apos;ve heard that before that &apos;s right now compared more than less .
people are always confused when i say , &quot; cut cuts . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried about their position .
but in fact , what we &apos;ve seen is that if you reduce the cost to reduce the cost of growth increases in terms of waterways , down the cost , and that &apos;s in the experience of the experience .
the r &amp; amp ; gamble &amp; amp ; d.
when dean ornish dropped 10 percent of the products on the average cat , they see that the increase in the  UNK  increases of rates of growth increases in a radical increases of growth and reduced the declining cost of cut emissions .
you know , average average in the store store shelves today .
walmart on today , i sold 100,000 products .
but the big brands is the  UNK  and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the and a it it a product it &apos;s . a
now in the world finance , i think think one of the best examples of the best way to make the best choice .
people are  UNK  in the united states .
for those people who want to choose them 20 to the financial markets , or not .
people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut it cuts . &quot;
all is the important choice .
and the first thing i do is to ask people to say , &quot; i know how different choices .
and if the person do you can &apos;t tell you .
and when we started taking part of the day we had this conversation with speech .
and gary says that he &apos;s ready to help people in this country , think of a non-profit the world &apos;s best way .
this is the description of human human description .
and i thought you should read it .
now i &apos;m going to give you a couple seconds to read it , if you want to ask you if you &apos;re willing to check your  UNK  .
good .
reading it ?
now i &apos;m going to show you more more .
you know , this is  UNK  , not .
now , who are ready for this ?
i thought i would hear a lot more loud .
okay .
in fact , you have a lot of objective information that you gain next time , and second item that i &apos;m going to assume that you feel it feel more in real time .
because the picture is made more practical with you .
it &apos;s  UNK  for the second technology that i in dealing with addressing pressing problems .
that &apos;s people to understand each difference between the choices that they have the ability to identify the outcomes and the choices consequences and choices , which is clear , it feels really profound .
why do people spend their average 15 to 30 percent when they take their money or cash ?
because it &apos;s not like that money .
and that &apos;s shown that it can make it more concrete , more becomes more effective as a tool to help people save more savings .
so the lessons i did with  UNK   UNK  and  UNK   UNK  and we  UNK   UNK  we did with each one with people in the  UNK   UNK  that people who worked at work , and now the people in this phase of them could have a plan for a plan .
and during this period , we &apos;ve been phase early stages one thing .
what we we added is that if we ask people to consider people to think about what happens in their future , if they save detroit to save them .
by doing it , by extension of the cost of 20 to 20 percent and increased people to raise money or ready to raise money to 40 percent increases .
the third technology : classification classification classification .
we can solve many more than we solve the resolve conflict .
for example , this is a ceremony we &apos;ve done in the newspaper in the magazine .
it turns out that the grocery stores  UNK  in the corridor and the located in the  UNK  where located from magazines in different kinds of different magazine .
what do you know ?
if i showed you that 600 and i have divided it up to 10 years ago when i showed you , and it divided into 20 pages , and i believe that you &apos;ve given me a lot of choice , and give you a choice of choice and choices , and if you choose to have a choice for choice , and if you choose to have a choice of choice , and if you &apos;ve given more than 90 percent of your choices , and if you &apos;ve given more than 90 percent of me if you
because the reason let me know how to break them dividing .
now this is two different different types of jewelry .
one thing was called &quot; jazz . &quot;
if you think on the left side of the left , and the right is supposed to be a jazz .
good , some people .
if you think on the left side , and it &apos;s the right side of you .
okay , much better .
now , it shows you &apos;re right .
on the left side and the right side is right , you know what doesn &apos;t .
this is a  UNK  .
what &apos;s needed to say to what i chose .
and you often see that that problem when it falls down to the list of your list of finance .
who is a lot of information ?
the fourth of my technologies : the conditions for complexity .
it shows us that we can actually handle a lot more information we can can do it more easily .
we have to halve the complexity .
i &apos;m preparing for you an example of what i &apos;m talking about .
let &apos;s think of a tough choice : buy a car .
this is a german bunker car that gives you an opportunity to follow your car you want to italy .
you have more than making a different decision making the decision .
and those choices make changes a choice of choice that they make decisions .
the car , i was outside my  UNK  , i chose  UNK  options .
engine ,  UNK  .
so what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to change the change that make decisions that make decisions .
so half of customers from a choice , the car , i , four drivers , four drivers .
there &apos;s another customers , and from the less choice , the four drivers , four feet away , and then i left a better option ,  UNK  ,  UNK  .
what i want to say is what ?
you &apos;re really busy .
if you &apos;ve got nodes and i &apos;m going to make that decision means that you have too many choices , too , that means that i mean , you &apos;ve got me .
what you &apos;re looking for is that people go from a lot less choices , and you feel more and more and more .
we &apos;re losing them .
they go from a low choice .
with  UNK  information , the number of choices .
the only thing i was done was to change the information in that information that was delivered in that expression .
if i start with you , i learned how to make choice .
even in the light , i &apos;m not afraid of anything that i &apos;m concerned about is concerned about the interior , about it , but it also leads to me .
it also gave me a huge amount of products that i &apos;m involved with it , so i &apos;m happy to motivate me and petition .
let me generalize .
i talked about engineering techniques to solve the choice of reducing energy crisis .
all of our speakers today to introduce you to design a control of control of control of control of your choice , and you can apply to yourself for your best and better service provider .
because i believe that the key to choose the best choice is the choice choice choice within choice choice .
and we more closely related to our better choice we can do better than choosing the arts .
thank you very much .
i think we have to do something about a traditional medicine in medicine .
and i thought this started from a doctor , that was me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been enough for a long enough effort to get a lot i &apos;m not going to work .
before i actually begin to think about the important part of the presentation , let &apos;s start with the ink .
why ? why ?
we &apos;re going to get the target , we &apos;re going to get the world cup .
who loves them , baseball ?
it &apos;s streams with statistically numbers .
and there are hundreds of numbers .
the book book was going to release the release of the released , and it basically said the data and statistical data visualization to build a  UNK  .
i &apos;m going to focus on a lot of hope i &apos;ve heard you &apos;ve heard .
it &apos;s the hockey index .
for example , there &apos;s a  UNK  .
so the old 10 times the size of the forearm was safe .
that means that it &apos;s in the football field , it falls down , it &apos;s not going down , and he wants to rip the levers for the first time , and i don &apos;t run .
for 10 times .
do you know a  UNK  player in the baseball game ?
well , good , is superstar .
so , you know what a football player index is something ?
by the way , it &apos;s a  UNK  player for 10 times .
myth -- big as big as a ted fellow williams named winner at the end of the 20th century .
so let &apos;s apply this story in the world of medicine to a lot more relevant to me , which is slightly more fun less than what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
suppose you get stuck and you &apos;ve got a given surgeon with surgery , which is  UNK  .
well , this is okay , right ?
now , suppose you live in a remote remote rural , and you have a  UNK  with your parkinson &apos;s disease and your family with a family .
but , , you know ?
she &apos;s going to find this way .
and the index index .
well , it &apos;s not fine .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
you think the  UNK  index , a surgeon , a surgeon nurse , a surgeon , a surgeon , a doctor , how many physicians ?
UNK  , great .
but in fact , nobody knows in the middle of a surgeon , a doctor or a surgeon needed to be the director . &quot;
what we &apos;re doing here is , even in the world with the perfect pitch .
never , absolute , being wrong , but you &apos;re worried about how to forget about how we &apos;re wrong .
and that &apos;s my message to my school .
i &apos;m a  UNK  obsessed with perfection .
in school , high school , you &apos;re going to go to school class , and i study it .
and so i have perfect .
i studied in my little little little  UNK  in my lab at the university of toronto , not reacting to this .
and i  UNK  everything .
i studied in the class of the class and started to  UNK  activity , which has changed the aortic valve from the aortic aortic dilation , the aortic valve .
i know intimately a different plan when it inhibited increases due to the kidney .
and during the process , i collected more and more knowledge .
i &apos;m so fortunate , i &apos;m graduating , brilliant ,  UNK  .
and i graduated from high school , i mean , if i remember , and you know , the better , the better the better , the better , the better , &apos; i know the better , &apos; better , &apos; i &apos;m going to make the wrong problem with the wrong problem .
and so it seems counterintuitive to me when i met her .
i &apos;m in a  UNK  at dartmouth day in toronto today at three emergency room visits to the emergency room in my hospital emergency room .
and i was offered the task in the bookstore involved .
and my task missions when emergency room asked emergency patient , i found the emergency room emergency room .
and with the report with my doctors .
and i met three  UNK  , three , barely breathing .
and when i heard her voice , she breathed out .
and when i hear some of you by three pictures , i hear hear the  UNK  in the  UNK  for two  UNK  failure due to the  UNK  .
this is happening when it doesn &apos;t work , and instead of releasing pink , and put some samples into the lung , and the blood , the patients , and lung patients .
this diagnosis is not hard .
i &apos;m diagnosed with therapy .
i &apos;m three to three .
i &apos;m  UNK  with three to  UNK  .
and within them and a half hours , and after two hours , then she started to feel more .
and i feel good .
and that &apos;s the wrong mistake i &apos;m wrong ; i &apos;m
in fact , i made a mistake .
i told three  UNK  without a  UNK  .
i &apos;m not taking the phone and i &apos;m supposed to do a doctor , and i &apos;m calling him to go on and tell each other for him to give him a chance to get the patient .
and you know the patient , you can add information about three .
maybe i have the right reason .
maybe i don &apos;t want to do a custom  UNK  .
maybe i want to succeed reasonably successful and from the responsible responsible for my  UNK  and doctors and doctors and patients who are not interested in doctors .
the second mistake i was worse .
when i  UNK  my  UNK  , i voice a little voice on my lap in the newspaper , i told me , &quot; you have to say , &quot; don &apos;t worry . &quot;
in fact , i was confident confidence , so i just asked the nurse , and she said , &quot; just think she was fine ? &quot;
and the nurse thought , and just say , &quot; oh , i &apos;m thinking she &apos;s going to be fine . &quot;
i remember every day yesterday .
so i  UNK  paper  UNK  , and ambulance ambulance , and my father gave him home .
and i went back to the clinic .
the rest day that day , red , i had a sense of  UNK  .
but i kept working .
by the day , i cleaned up a hospital and walked to the parking car , so i took the car to take my home and then i did a job . i don &apos;t normally do it .
i crossed the emergency room .
and there &apos;s one other day , the nurse , not nurse to nurse , and the nurse is a nurse , with me , with three three or four puppy , which is the number of three doctors that i know .
it was awesome , and it was three awesome , and emergency medical treatment , particularly because we had a short amount of time .
and she is , remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient ? &quot;
there &apos;s a simple question .
&quot; oh , she went back to her . &quot;
okay , three .
she came back to death .
they were three hours after three , , when i gave her home , and my grandmother &apos;s family and you call back to the emergency three and three emergency rooms and three and three emergency rooms , and she &apos;s just 50 percent of the monster in the high line , the rates of  UNK  .
and she almost didn &apos;t breathe and she  UNK  .
and the emergency room uses a new way .
they give her blood pressure .
they put her in the  UNK  .
and i was shocked .
and as i sat on a train mountain , because when he stood in the third part , she was able to grab in intensive care , and i hope he was hoping .
and in two or three days later , there was no doubt that never wake up .
her was devastated changes .
and the whole family together .
and in eight or eight years later , they fate .
and after about nine days later , they leave her parents --  UNK  , wives , mothers , mothers , mothers .
they would never forget him named him .
and that &apos;s what i know about that .
in my next few weeks , i was caring for myself and my first day where i had not a healthy culture in our culture -- and in my culture -- i felt lonely culture , i felt  UNK  , but i felt powerless to feel like myself , because i don &apos;t know where i can &apos;t speak .
you know a great depression , when you &apos;re authentic , the one that you &apos;ve got yourself best , and they &apos;ve never been shot in the most powerful and you  UNK  yourself and the  UNK  and and and the and the and the and the and the and the and the , you and and you and and you the wrong , , , and and and and you wrong , and and , and , , and and and and you wrong , , and and , and and , and you wrong .
and you damage and you have never committed to you .
this is a  UNK  .
the thylacine is not a bad thing about me .
that &apos;s not saying , you don &apos;t have bad guys , but that &apos;s bad news .
and that &apos;s what i feel .
and not because the doctor &apos;s guidance instruction ; it &apos;s easy .
he spoke to his family , and i was pretty disappointed him in ensuring that every day and i &apos;m not sure .
and i wonder myself .
why did i not ask the question why ? why bother ?
and in the earliest moments : why is it wrong ?
why ? i mean ?
it &apos;s sure , sure .
i began to see a bit more .
and in a lot of days , a lot of black holes in the cloud between the sun and the dark holes , and i &apos;m wondering , i &apos;m sure i can feel slightly more .
and i &apos;m from  UNK  myself , if i like to try to make twice as good as usual , and never make any mistakes , let &apos;s stop the conscience of conscience .
and that &apos;s good .
and i went back to work .
and that happens .
two years later i was officially officially at the emergency room in a hospital , community , and i was a 25 year-old boy .
when he was busy busy , i was asking .
he just kept on it .
i watched my throat , it was  UNK  .
and i  UNK   UNK  .
and even when he &apos;s walking away from his father , he &apos;s kind of irrelevant .
and after two days coming to the middle of the emergency room , and that &apos;s the time my team &apos;s asking me to ask in my office .
and she said , &quot; hey , remember ?
&quot; remember the patient ?
turns turns out , he &apos;s often  UNK  .
he was sick , he could be dangerous .
you can pay this on the google , but it &apos;s a  UNK  infection , it &apos;s  UNK  , it &apos;s  UNK  .
and luckily he was not dead .
he must antibiotics and rehabilitation after a few days .
and i went through a vacuum time , and i felt powerless to go back , and when i was again again , again , again .
secondly , a  UNK  axis , i &apos;m not  UNK  .
now , wrong wrong , i &apos;m not particularly easy for the first time in a hospital where only 14 years .
in both cases , i &apos;m not acting for my patients and i don &apos;t think of care .
there is a patient who thought i was a kidney .
i &apos;m asking for x-ray crystallography .
so patients are infected .
i then asked the country to get to the patients , and his colleagues to come to him .
and colleagues i was looking at the discovery and when he noticed under the lower left , he was also called surgery .
in both cases , patients are regarded and fine .
but every time , they all went to my cave , and i looked at me .
and i want to tell you that the worst parts of the worst mistake i just did when i was in the first year of my work .
some of my mistakes on the five years ago .
UNK  ,  UNK  , not .
the problem is this : if i can &apos;t talk about the mistake mistake , i if i lost my voice to the voice of my voice voice a little voice for me to know what to happen , how can i come up with my colleagues ?
how do i teach them to what i &apos;ve done to them ?
if i walked into a room -- like me , i don &apos;t know if you think about what i thought .
at the end of the time when you smile hear about the wrong mistake , then mistake ? wrong mistake ?
well , you have a dinner party and you probably hear about a guy talking about a rat , but you will not listen to the mistake of them .
if i had to go into a room full of my colleagues and help them help and start talking to tell me what you &apos;ve told me , you can &apos;t tell me two weeks before they puke before .
and in fact , if i know that my coworkers and my colleagues know that my father &apos;s chief to my left leg to the heart of my patients , my hospitals in my hospital , i believe , i would go to the side of my face , i would have seen the difficulty in the face of the face that i was looking at .
it &apos;s a system .
complete fallacy completely wrong .
it was a system that had a system of two positions -- and the mistakes wrong , the doctors don &apos;t burn and fails , and the person who ended up and fails and end of the success .
and it &apos;s almost like a reaction reaction , such as a  UNK  attack .
and we have this idea that if we get rid of those errors , we got rid of the wrong way out of the problem , simply the safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
and in the 20 years , i write and writing about the medicine of medicine , i &apos;ve been talking about a mistake and in the wrong medical literature to learn about the new body , but one of my favorite poems in toronto , i published the founder of my tv show , &quot; &quot;  UNK  television . &quot;
and what i learned is that all the time
we work in a system system that happened during the day , in the 10 days of print drugs or a drug or a dose of the dose , or in some cases from hospitals to the hospital .
in this country , i  UNK   UNK  , because of canada .
in the united states , medicine in the medical institute .
in both cases , these are the low cost , compared to reality , because we have never seen this as we should have .
and this is the problem .
in a hospital system where the medical industry says double two or three years , you can &apos;t keep up with you .
the lack of sleep is overwhelming .
we can &apos;t get rid of this .
we have stereotypes on our experience , for example , i can accept depression as a psychiatric experience .
now that patients are clinically depressed , let &apos;s smile , and he says , &quot; and and you know , and you can add a smell of your breath , and suddenly he suddenly got a bad stroke of my illness .
i &apos;m not using a  UNK  anymore .
i &apos;m not clear .
and my patient is not in the middle of the ; ; it &apos;s not the case anymore .
that &apos;s wrong , it &apos;s wrong .
so , if you deal with the system , like i &apos;ve been taught , and to get rid of the wrong
and you know what people want to talk about the worst case ?
on the show of my television , &quot;  UNK  white , &quot; i &quot; art , &quot; i made a mistake , &quot; which is the worst mistake , i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you from each parent , every member of the office , &quot; at the heart of the office , i thought , &quot; oh my god , what &apos;s the wrong problem , &quot; blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
and they disappeared away , and they will break away , and then they mate and they mate and they mate with my story .
they want to tell their stories . they want their name .
they wanted to say , &quot; hey , look at that day . &quot;
what they need is an environment for them to say that .
what they need is a culture .
and this started from an  UNK  once .
the physicians , according to the concept of concept , is a bone of bone in meat , which is just one person , just to accept that , that &apos;s not a mistake , when it &apos;s wrong .
she shared experiences with others .
it was very supportive of other people talking about their mistake .
and just turned out the other side of the road , not kind of  UNK  , &quot; a way , to make people better .
and just in the culture of culture that institutional control are controlled by control systems , and when people control systems , they will make mistakes .
so this system hasn &apos;t evolved to create a plan plan to create politically mistakes , and not too much , and create a reconciliation , for supporting the political , but who doesn &apos;t know where the health impacts can be used to be wrong .
my name is brian .
i &apos;m a physician in a new concept .
i am .
i &apos;m very sorry about that , but i tried to learn something that i can give someone else .
i still don &apos;t know what you think about , but i can do it .
and let me close with my own voice : i remember .
hi : hi . i &apos;m a  UNK  . i mean a lot of corporate sponsors , and i watched the videos on youtube videos .
seriously .
today we &apos;re going to spend a little bit of time talking about how videos videos will be in a short time , and why is why this is .
we all want to be the celebrities star , famous , and as i &apos;m young , that seems very difficult to do .
but now , videos on the web are done to do any any of us or any creative product that we can become completely different in the world &apos;s cultures .
anyone in your body can become famous on the internet with the seventh week .
but there is more than 48 hours on youtube .
and in some sense , there &apos;s a very small scale of  UNK  , which is considered , and it became a cultural phenomenon .
so what happens ?
there &apos;s three reasons : the  UNK  , the community involved .
let &apos;s start .
oh god . oh my god .
oh god .
UNK  !
UNK  ,  UNK  !
last year , grizzly bears had posted this video photo posted outside of the national park in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , there was 23 million views .
this is a chart graph that when this video first became popular .
but bear is not doing this .
he just wanted to see the  UNK  .
because this is what you do when you &apos;re a large bear bear bear in the mountain .
he was actually a lot of nature videos .
while this video was posted on a month .
so what happens here here ?
actually , the reason is jimmy  UNK  .
jimmy  UNK  that i posted on twitter at the end of the video , which became so popular .
because people make expressions of intimacy like  UNK  , give us some interesting and interesting things that come to a greater amount of audience .
number 6 , six of them down on friday street , people are looking forward to the weekend on the weekend , six of the weekend , six of the weekend on the street .
&quot; the  UNK  of &quot; rebecca rebecca saxe is one of the most popular videos .
with 200 million views .
this is the chart .
and like &quot;  UNK  . it seems like it speaks for itself .
so what &apos;s happening today ?
well , it &apos;s a fifth day , right .
and if you &apos;re wondering from the other side points , they &apos;re at friday .
so what is today ?
ah ,  UNK  . i went to see a diary page .
michael bloomberg from michael  UNK  from a mystery is one of the first people to bring this together on this social network .
but it &apos;s important to be an individual or a group of people who create a  UNK  and and share with them a wider crowd , a lot more viewers , to help it .
and so this community was then subsequently from the end of this story , and they started talking about it .
now the result is more than 10,000 version of  UNK  &quot; on youtube .
even in the first seven days , in every day , there was a video that was posted on a video .
it &apos;s kind of like the entertainment of 20th century , participating in this community is how we become part of the phenomenon of  UNK  or something like that .
&quot;  UNK  &quot; is an image of an animation with cartoons .
it &apos;s just like this .
this video has close 50 million views across the slide .
and if you think this is kind of weird , you know , there &apos;s a three version of it now four million views .
even the cat sees watching this video .
but cats &apos;s watching the cats cats watching this video .
but what &apos;s important is that creativity is inspired by the culture of islamic culture .
there are also  UNK  .
somebody donated a new version .
and then it  UNK  international disclosure .
a biohacker community says it is a  UNK  thing -- something that we can do is part of that .
because now we just don &apos;t enjoy it .
and who can predict anything about this ?
people might say , &quot;  UNK   UNK  or
can you write a  UNK  scenario ?
in a world of digital video games than two hours a day at each day , which is unique and surprising that can cause this one .
when a friend of mine told me told me that i need to watch this amazing insight to a bunch of people to the city bike in new york city , i don &apos;t have to admit .
so my travels of video games don &apos;t run in the bike lane , but often don &apos;t make things you don &apos;t need to go to the bike lane for bike lanes .
it was astonishing and funny , casey martin , and his idea was able to take five million views .
and so this approach is still working with new things that we do .
and so it brings us a big question .
the grizzly bear  UNK  : what does that mean ?
UNK  .
what does that mean ?
but the creator of the people , the community involved , the things that are now completely different from , now , is a traditional subject of traditional backgrounds , and a culture of any media culture and anyone who speaks to the audience and accessible to the audience .
i mean , i &apos;ve been mentioning earlier in one of the biggest stars in the world , a couple of justin , beginning to youtube .
nobody has allowed your idea .
and we all feel feel some of our cultures in our own pop culture .
and these things aren &apos;t the essential qualities of the media before , as well as opposed to the media medium , but now they &apos;re going to be shaping the future of entertainment .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about today .
now i &apos;m working in the industry industry .
and i remember each of my new company was trying to get in the environment by looking at me .
and it took me contribution from communities .
this is a short video showing what we &apos;re doing .
they are .
maybe for a second to run a video .
we &apos;ll only -- we can skip -- i &apos;m going to go through a video .
not .
this is not ...
okay .
the sun is ...
oh , i &apos;m going now ?
okay . thank you very much .
my story began to start in here , in the last two years ago .
and at the time i was in in the desert , in the sky ceiling of  UNK  ,  UNK  .
we spoke to  UNK  . we have from india poised to india .
it &apos;s like , when we want we want to go back and ride into a bay .
today we do the same thing with airplanes .
that time , when  UNK  ,  UNK  , from  UNK   UNK  , when  UNK   UNK  , when  UNK   UNK  , when no  UNK  , they won &apos;t fall off the ground , and you get into the water .
today , we do it with machines and machines .
the conclusion that we &apos;re allowed to replace .
and it makes me sad .
and i feel i &apos;m afraid of becoming a fear of technology .
i feared the idea that i &apos;m going to lose hope and enjoy the  UNK  camera , without checking me on twitter .
and it seems to be new new technologies that create magic , not to kill it .
when i was a little girl , i was raised with the gears in my pocket .
and this piece of technology is 50 years of the magic object for me .
it became the right side of the gold , and the big part of the world and the and and imagery the imaginations of my imagination .
so i felt like the phone gears of our mobile phones , and the camera takes us to our eyes .
they are inspiration .
and so i jumped into the dance , jumped into this technology in the world , let me see how to allow it to be fooled .
i &apos;ve been spoken since i was 16 years old .
and so when i saw the ipad , i saw it was a  UNK  storytelling storytelling across the world .
it knows what we feel .
it knows where we are .
it &apos;s an image , the illustration , the tone , tone and touch .
the storytelling is becoming increasingly .
what are we doing with it ?
so actually i &apos;m going to dive up and start panel , an interactive software interactive application .
here , say , &quot; you put your hands up . &quot;
and so -- it says , &quot; this book is my name ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
and in fact , i turn into a character in the book .
at some point , a nice little piece of bone , and i &apos;m going to -- and you know the little nervous system , the gps system -- a letter -- that &apos;s sent to the door to the ipad .
it &apos;s incredibly exciting to me .
now , i have a lot of magic .
and i mean , i &apos;m not  UNK  or  UNK  , i mean , i mean , i mean , this is the kind of  UNK  , ideas that we &apos;ve been  UNK  .
the idea idea in  UNK   UNK  , why don &apos;t know why .
and so here you are , you need to pick up , fireflies .
and they &apos;re going to shine light through the rest of the book .
another naive idea was when i was a teenager , is a large one that could be a single one
and so here , this new new book and new world became a tiny little piece of plastic that i put in this device in this device .
and a map open .
at the same time , the book book is mapping , maps map maps .
this is a map from  UNK  and and shine light to shine the formula for the rest of the book .
at certain certain moment in the book , it would show you in it .
so i &apos;m going to go now .
one more important thing for me personally is actually creating real content .
here , here are  UNK  .
we &apos;ve all heard about , you know , we &apos;ve heard about the voices of music , but there &apos;s one thing , but there &apos;s not one of the indian guys in india , how much  UNK  ?
but this  UNK   UNK  has been lifted up in the  UNK  of the millions of years old in a  UNK  book .
and so they bring back to their children &apos;s book .
and a story also reflects a new issues like the environmental problem .
by the way the environment , i think a big problem in the last 10 years is covered with these little bags rooms in the air , made into the computer screen , not computers .
but with mobile technology , we can bring out to the outside world , naturally in the world .
one of the activities interactions in the book is that you &apos;re walking on a journey journey in that finding out the camera out of the camera takes out of the camera , and the pictures of the nature of different objects .
when i remember , i have a collection of thousands of collections , , collections and countless .
and that &apos;s why today we don &apos;t .
so , in the back of the ritual , you &apos;ve got to go out , and , in a bell , take a picture , and a flower picks it .
in one other chapter , you have to take a piece of  UNK  and his name .
and what happens is that you will create a collection of collection that you can actually put in the net .
a baby in london is a high degree , and he says , &quot; oh , you see him . &quot;
one babies say , &quot; today i see today . &quot;
and that creates a kind of social fabric that you &apos;ve collected .
in the capacity , the magic , the earth and technology , many other possibilities .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to have an interaction which you interact with video and video recording and technology through this technology , augmented reality , you can see this  UNK  increase in the outside of an outdoor house .
at a moment , your screen is .
and so you have to create hours and hour and read the rest of your book .
we &apos;re moving towards all , we &apos;re moving towards a world where the world &apos;s closer and closer to technology and technology , and allows us to get closer together .
we &apos;re mining energy .
we &apos;re taking our children and ourselves and closer to our world and our magic and love and joy and cherish the joy of our kids who simply makes a simple .
thank you .
because i &apos;m often trying to explain to explain people to understand all the technologies that are going to come together , and i think , because i &apos;ve been in some of you here today , i &apos;m sure you i &apos;m going to you thinking , and you know , , , , science and , , science and , science and , science and , science and , science and , , science is incredible things
i &apos;m going to start with a quick demonstration of paper .
next , if you can slide on this page .
this is just a report report that i picked randomly out in my document .
what i want to show you is that people are not the detailed journals that they are .
this is a report report that we analyzed analysis that we &apos;re comparing the power between the power of  UNK  power .
and what &apos;s interesting is the report report , like a lot of other press reports that we &apos;re familiar with us , is a line of a straight line on a curve curve .
in other words , the silver represents here represents a level of a month .
and this is a new thing that reminds us about the bell curve .
there &apos;s something weird .
and that &apos;s basically what i want to say .
now , if you can get bigger .
if you can go to a higher pitches , because i use a piece of paper .
why do we have to curve the curve technology along your streets ?
and the answer is , if i talk about it on a normal curve , where it is , this is a time , and this is what this technology is , is what i &apos;m trying to do .
they seem to be moving like this .
and they don &apos;t tell us .
now if i talk about the graph , for example , technologies , technology can be shipping , on a bell curve , it &apos;s very , very , very similar .
but this happens , everything changes .
so , if the shipping container evolves like this , because it &apos;s a procedure , i can call a taxi and a museum in in 30 seconds .
it &apos;s not .
and without precedent , historically in the development of growth , by changing the way over the past several years .
now the question i want to ask is , if you look at the exponential curve , they don &apos;t even notice .
things can &apos;t change quickly , as they &apos;re going on .
one of two things will happen .
or it might turn into a form of curves like this , until something completely different happens , or it might turn it into something like this .
that &apos;s all what can happen .
now , i &apos;m now optimistic , so i think that it can be in this way .
if that &apos;s true , it means we are in the middle of the phase .
we are in the line in the process between the world during the state of every moment where i am in the world that exists exist .
and so , what i &apos;d like to ask , what i &apos;m asking , i &apos;m asking myself , what is the state of the world that exist ?
what &apos;s new state world is i &apos;m going ?
because this process seems very difficult to predict when we &apos;re in the middle of the process .
when i was a kid who grew up in the future , for me to the year 2000 , and i would often expect people going to 2000 .
this is a conference that sits around the future , and you can see that future can spin the future around the year 2000 .
it &apos;s from distant when we go .
so in the other words , the future future seems to be a year for life .
i think the reason why is because all of us feel that something is happening at that moment .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on . we can feel it .
and we know that it doesn &apos;t mean when we think about 30 , 50 years later , all of this is going to be very different to make a difference that we &apos;re not going to do today .
so what i want to talk about is , is possible , is that we may be a phase transition .
to order to do something i &apos;m going to talk about something really not related to technology and technology .
because i think that the only way to understand understand this is actually put in the past and in a long-term view of the object .
work-life balance : i wanted to look at the balance of life on earth earth .
and so , i thought this picture meant that if it looked at people in this angle with a couple of years .
if everyone wants to go back to two billion years ago , every single earth , like that , with the pieces of chemicals .
and if people look at the chemical form of chemistry , they begin to understand how they form .
and i think there are  UNK  that explains how to begin with it , and i &apos;m going to tell you about a simple story , it tells the story , which at the time , it &apos;s kind of  UNK  around us , oily  UNK  around the sky , where it &apos;s exploding around the sky .
and some of the oil droplet is a combination of chemical soup in the components that made it into the chemical soup with the chemistry and the crunchy  UNK  .
and these oil are starting to drop them .
and these are the primitive stem cells .
but today that oil hasn &apos;t actually exist , as we go right now , because all of them are accidental by random chemical .
and every time it &apos;s split up , they &apos;re not chemical .
and therefore , all of us are slightly different .
in fact , they have different ways to make better connections with chemical inks around them .
so the tends tends to indicate more .
and this is just a chemistry form of life , but it &apos;s more interesting than when they got to  UNK  .
by some way we don &apos;t understand , but we learn to learn how to get information .
they learn a information that information information from information that is the  UNK  of stem cells .
in other words , they formed under the evolution of consciousness , imitating a form of authorship that allow them to control them .
the surprising thing is that the information is that information is so evolutionarily because it has evolved since a million years ago .
in fact , our genes , there &apos;s an exact norm and the same way .
in fact , every living organism has been genetically engineered by its genome and the complete banking system .
in fact , one of the things that i &apos;ve done is that we now can unlock a lot of record .
i have here to  UNK  100 panels , which i have to try to hide the employees .
but in it -- what i do is formed this code -- where there &apos;s a standard code that we used to refer to the  UNK  -- and i wrote down the business of my dna in a sample of dna and  UNK  dna .
if there &apos;s a million like hundreds of copies copies copies of business , i can invite you in this room , and , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in all of the world , in all of the world , and in the world , and it &apos;s in the world , and it &apos;s in the world .
if i &apos;m a marketer , i could turn it into a virus and put it into this room .
so what &apos;s next ?
a set of dna is an interesting step .
and it generates these cells -- these cells survive more than one billion years .
but then after that , there &apos;s another phase of the very interesting period when things become completely different , and this is where the cells begin with cells and exchange information .
i don &apos;t know if you know what it is , but you can actually poison the dna .
because that &apos;s , for example , antibiotics .
some of these bacteria have been able to figure out how drug penicillin , and it extracts around the dna of information with other bacteria , and then we have a lot of other bacteria that are able to communicate because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information , because of information
the communication allows us to organize bacteria that bacteria can form in these types of bacteria ; they &apos;re compatible with each other .
and therefore , they survive or death , and that means that , if a consensus , the good community , within the community , in the middle of the san francisco , and they evolved to
the time that happens when those communities come together , in fact , they formed together to form a recipe for the entire human dna .
and so , in the process , it &apos;s very exciting to look at about a billion years .
and at that time , we have the population stem cells , there are different kinds of different cells , working together .
and in fact , we are a single cell .
we have lots of cells that they can &apos;t exist .
your skin is not going to work without your heart cells , heart cells , and there &apos;s a lot of other cells cells .
so these communities began to evolve interesting interesting evolution that evolution doesn &apos;t exist on a cell , but on a colony that we call alive .
the next process is happening in these populations .
these populations cells , once again , starting to extract information .
and they begin to form special  UNK  , which didn &apos;t work out there .
and that &apos;s the synapse .
stem cells is sensory information that that connects the cell populations cells .
and in fact , they pollen are in the colony and and populations that are unique in terms of responsibility .
and that &apos;s the brain system and the neural system .
and they bring back in the evolution of evolution .
because at the time , one day -- information that can happen in the presence of a survival , rather than one of the time .
so the one can live , for example , not to eat it with a taste of food , and it doesn &apos;t feel like when it gets too late .
this could happen in during the time of living systems , while they formed the structure of this structure , and this particular process of information , namely that had been learning to evolve in evolution by hundreds of thousands of years of thousands of years of thousands of years .
the neural system , that actually holds the structure of particular information , and that strengthening quickly accelerated evolution .
because evolution evolves today can happen within one individual .
it could happen in time .
but then what happens is that the whole thing of of course is , of course , of course , in exchange information .
for example , the complex version is that we know the language of our languages .
if you think about it , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a great invention .
i have a complex thought , complexity , ambiguous and ambiguity .
i &apos;m sitting here saying , &quot; oh , i hope to create a new kind of a mess and scary and a bit like a thinking of my mind .
but we are taking a very complicated circuit , transforming it into a thick , and teach language and shaped in a new form of new complexity .
this one allows us to start as a living body .
and in fact , what we &apos;ve done is human beings , we know .
we are experiencing the same process as the living organisms that we &apos;ve grown up with cells , and through selective breeding ,  UNK  , processes , sensory information .
for example , translating the voice is a little bit .
the telephone , computers ,  UNK  , cd , and many other things that are tools that we &apos;ve created in social media to work with information .
and they &apos;re all connected into a larger community , and we evolved to have evolved to us .
so now , evolution can evolve in a couple of times .
people have been watching a few examples of evolution that when we evolved to  UNK  the evolution in front of them .
now we have accelerated accelerate .
so the first step of my story telling me of a billion people in the year .
and the next stages , the nervous system and the brain , several hundred million years ago .
the next process , as languages and things like that , in less than a million years .
and the follow-up process , like like , it seems to be a few decades .
and this process goes on and become a sense , i guess it &apos;s from the right side of the -- -- that a slow pace pace .
the more change the longer change , it changes the change .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in the curves of this curve .
we &apos;re seeing this process from itself .
now i designed computer to make money , and i know that i devices i designed my computer to use computer graphics could not have access to technology .
so now , what i do is design as an object , if it is impossible to follow them .
i don &apos;t know all of the vending machine .
because there &apos;s billions of transistors .
instead , , what i wanted to do in design and doing open-heart surgery at the operating system that we thought we were able to think about how the filter was able to filter the filter and filter into mechanical machines , and we could use them much more efficient and more efficient .
and in fact , sometimes they do it properly , we don &apos;t even know what we do .
a particularly interesting way , i &apos;m still a lot of science is evolution .
what we did was we put in a machine protocols developed this period of time .
for example , in particular cases , we can actually develop a program with stand-up  UNK  .
in other words , &quot; computers , can you make hundreds of millions of  UNK  .
now if you can do all of these random instructions , all of these programs , and they pick up the best signal that i want to do . &quot;
in other words , i wanted to try to .
when i want to organize them , some of them are examples of simplicity .
and find the most  UNK  activities .
and of course ,  UNK  randomly will not tend to organize numbers , so that no one is going to do the task .
but one of them , if you get lucky .
and i said , &quot; computers , are you going to pick up 10 percent of the best one that do best .
keep them .
and let &apos;s let the copy of the  UNK  teach the best numbers .
and let &apos;s copy them at the same time .
take the two and they show them the product of the product the same sets of them , and their product .
i have now a new generation program , which is made by all of these programs that make a better job .
i said to the computer , &quot; let &apos;s repeat the process . &quot;
evaluate them again .
maybe a couple of life . wait .
and then again , it &apos;s a different generation .
every single individual within each generation is just a few milliseconds seconds .
and so , i can do a evolution of evolution several million years ago in a few minutes , or if in a few cases .
the end of the process , i &apos;m going to have perfect program with perfect numbers .
in fact , they &apos;re more productive programs that i can  UNK  .
now if i look at these programs , i don &apos;t show people how they work .
i &apos;m always trying to show them and show you how it works .
they are very delicate programs .
but they do it .
and in fact , i know , confidence was very confident to do because they come from hundreds of thousands of programs .
in fact , it &apos;s essential programs that depend on her work .
i &apos;ve listened to a quarter of a coffee in my pocket with , and he taking out and say , &quot; oh , look .
it says , &quot; this airplane plane has a detail detailed detail to make a safety flight . &quot;
in fact , we all know that design process is not very complicated .
so we &apos;re beginning to rely on computers to make a different design process .
and it allows us to produce more complex products than to build furniture .
and yet we don &apos;t really understand the sense of choice .
and so in a corner , it &apos;s pushing us forward .
we &apos;re using these programs to create faster than we can do faster .
and so it &apos;s driving itself .
this is happening faster and it &apos;s why i see it quite ambiguous .
because all this technology has accelerated from itself .
we &apos;re taking off .
and we &apos;re at the moment in the same process as when we can live in cellular organism .
we are noble  UNK  and we &apos;re near as we understand where we are creating .
we &apos;re at the moment .
but i think there &apos;s something that animates us .
i think we &apos;re going to be too sure if we are the final product of evolution .
and i think that all of us here is a part of the next generation -- no matter what it is .
the lunch i &apos;m approaching me , and i think i &apos;m going to pause in front of me , when i was born with nature .
a couple of years ago i started a a programming program of hardware and technologies that they created for a year and they work in the exact same environment that they would like to hate ; they had to do the government for governments .
this program is called the code for code , and this program is kind of like a  UNK  program .
we have a few different candidates every year , they &apos;re going to work with the city .
instead of giving them the third world , we give them a  UNK  .
at that point , they would write a great app .
but what they actually do is proving things that can happen in the world today .
let &apos;s talk about al .
the faucet is an  UNK  in boston .
it looks like looking for a dating date , but it &apos;s actually waiting for someone who &apos;s waiting for him , because he knows that he doesn &apos;t know how to beat the flame in the sky .
how can we search for help in a situation like this ?
last year , we had a team in boston to program for the program .
they &apos;re in february here .
they noticed that the city has never been  UNK  .
but a member of this is a guy named erik  UNK  , and i noticed something else , is that people who are still walking around 180 degrees before .
so he was doing open-heart surgery , who was going to do with an app .
it &apos;s a small application that you can do with you .
you can lock it down there .
every time you do it , you have to name it , and his name is the first name .
if you don &apos;t do it , you can get it .
so this is motivation .
this is a small application .
maybe it &apos;s the tiniest number of r &amp; amp ; and in the past year .
but it did work without a government .
it spread .
a guy in the medina of the city &apos;s app that knows that this app has led to this , and he realized that he can use it , not to be cool , to empower people to the tsunami .
it works very important , but people are collecting from energy .
so he helped dan  UNK  .
and so we decided to use this software software to help people to get out of the water .
chicago app has allowed anybody to ban the sidewalk on the sidewalk .
now there is nine cities on the app plan .
it &apos;s grown exponentially , and there &apos;s natural .
if you know anything about the state of technology , you &apos;ll learn that this is not normal .
the introduction of software started a couple of years ago .
last year , we had a team of people who worked in a project for a two-and-a-half months of july .
the parenting project helps seeking our school with our kids .
there &apos;s people telling us that as usual , in order to build a software that will take at least two years and spend two million dollars .
but the numbers is not .
now there &apos;s a  UNK  project in utah , but 60,000 dollars costs 60,000 dollars , which is still , it doesn &apos;t work .
and the other project in the project
so an app has been developed in a few milliseconds , which is a  UNK  of the
it shows how the government worked more effectively -- unlike companies like private companies , as many people think .
and even the same technology doesn &apos;t work , the internet is more true .
that means not control , and that &apos;s always fine .
it &apos;s important .
but what &apos;s more important is that it &apos;s just the new way to cope with the government &apos;s problem -- not a rigid problem , but that &apos;s the actions of our actions .
it &apos;s a great news , because we &apos;re going to have more of these technologies with digital computing technology .
today there &apos;s a lot of these supportive communities who helped build tools to work together .
it &apos;s not just a member of the code for america , for hundreds of millions of people around the country that are blogging daily basis for the daily communities that we are in our communities .
they didn &apos;t abandon up .
they &apos;re bored with the government , but they didn &apos;t cry , they managed to figure out how to fix them .
and these people that know that we &apos;re focused on it .
that &apos;s when you throw emotions from the politics of politics and  UNK  at the end of  UNK  and all of us , getting rid of the state , and the essence of the speech itself , in the heart of the  UNK  , in action , &quot; action , &quot; don &apos;t act of actions . &quot;
now there &apos;s a lot of belief in the trust .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you to consider , because everything is changing .
politics has changed ; governments are changing .
and by the state of israel , sacked us from us to power -- remember , &quot; what ? &quot;
when i started this program , i didn &apos;t know the government .
like many people , i think the fundamental government is just going to vote .
after two years , i was accepted to the local authorities , and  UNK  rats .
this is central information and communication .
this is where you might say if you call your  UNK  from the city .
if you have an opportunity to work in the center of the street , like a  UNK  , a member of our fellow -- in fact , in fact , they do all of you -- you can see what they call me a lot of people in the audience , a lot of  UNK  , a problem with a rat , a friend of  UNK  , you got a  UNK  .
scott was aware of this .
he  UNK  &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
he didn &apos;t think of anything else .
at the end , he said , &quot; look , you can &apos;t have to open your door to your door and i play a lot of music and look at what &apos;s going on ?
and that &apos;s right .
but that &apos;s not all about rats .
pilot is not just a  UNK  .
it has an app , a website and a smartphone app on the phone , called  UNK  .
we didn &apos;t writing this app .
this is the work of human capital at the  UNK  offices in the city .
and one day -- this is actually a -- report -- one thing : &quot; a mouse &apos;s shirt in the  UNK  .
how do it handle ? &quot;
but it occurred to  UNK   UNK  .
scott &apos;s directly .
but on top of all ,  UNK  , everything was available , to see all .
and in this case , one of the neighbors .
in the next report report , &quot; i was walking in the zone , a garbage bin .
okay ?
UNK  trash , go home .
UNK  , good  UNK  . &quot;
quite simple .
it &apos;s interesting . this is how technology is technology .
this is also a great example of how the u.s. government
but that &apos;s also an example of the government as a system .
i &apos;m not talking about definition of the system in the technology .
i &apos;m just talking about a network of support .
people are helping each other , the governments that are the key role here .
it connects those two together .
if necessary , our service can help us , connect , one of neighbors is a better solution and save the government of customers .
when these people help us , the bigger community is larger .
if we call the base of animals , that &apos;s going to spend more money .
one of the important things that we need to think about is politics .
most people understand that , but they think that this is what comes in .
that shows the state system and the elections .
let &apos;s see , how many of us have a political party -- and we often spend a lot of energy to spend a political solution -- politics and then we &apos;re going to take our hands and hope and reflect the standards of our government and our values , and then we need to change our mindsets , and then we need to change the machines ?
that &apos;s because the state of like a ocean , and it &apos;s just one fifth of the layers of six inches on the surface .
and what we are under the policy-making is called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
we cherish those words .
but this is what we helped us , and it takes us to fight for ourselves , and then we eliminate ourselves .
some people are very attractive .
if we want to do the government for ourselves , we have to make that exciting system .
because that &apos;s the real job .
we have to invest in government .
that &apos;s what  UNK  did .
have you ever seen these people ?
it &apos;s a citizen group of career who wrote a  UNK  report to pay for the op-ed of the test offered a promise of financial reforms .
that &apos;s not political , but the bureaucratic system .
for those of us who are governments in the governments , this is what we ask ourselves for ourselves to the rest of our offspring .
you have to recognize those challenges that they &apos;re facing .
we &apos;re going to achieve what we need to do , but how do we represent us all ?
we can &apos;t do it unless we do it , we need it to work .
the great news is now helping technologies to improve the function of the best government in the real world .
we have a generation that grew up with the development of the internet , and we don &apos;t know what difficult to grasp together , you can control the system .
now the average age of member of us is a  UNK  , is envy , i envy almost older .
this is the voices of our voices for the rights .
the war for them is not what we &apos;re not going to speak ; they &apos;re supposed to do .
they can take credit on any media , and they &apos;re doing it .
when they deal with their issues , they could not care about their voice .
they use their hands .
they use their hands on the app to help improve the government .
these applications helps us to use us .
so that &apos;s the faucet faucet , finger on fire , with a trash bin in the garbage .
sure , we can switch gears with fire , and many people have done .
but applications like the service that remind us that we don &apos;t just customers , and we don &apos;t just customers .
moreover , we are .
and we can &apos;t stable government to our government when we perform good citizens .
i have a question for all of you here : when the important need to teach them to our hands , all of us , we &apos;re going to be a a crowd , or are we going to become a member of our team together ?
thank you .
i want to talk to you why a lot of reasons why a lot of health projects have failed conversations .
and i actually think that the most important thing is that we don &apos;t listen hearing anymore .
one of the things that we did at the university of michigan was a  UNK  .
it &apos;s not a way of science -- he put a cup or a little coffee , and ask the family , and the family , and what
what can we help you ? &quot;
and we thought that this is one of the main reasons why all of -- perhaps not -- but most of the medical professionals projects , when we fail when we don &apos;t listen anymore .
this is a electronic camera .
it has a button in the middle .
on sunday morning .
and i &apos;m very nervous and nervous nervous , as you can see .
i feared myself to  UNK  .
but what this means is that the device is whenever i &apos;m gaining weight , gaining weight , send it to the google &apos;s data .
and my doctor &apos;s going to get these data , so he can see what the problem is involved with my weight .
but another thing .
as some of you know that i have more than 1,500 people on the page .
so every morning i don &apos;t need to get wifi and before i go to the cars , i started talking to that i thought , &quot; i thought i want to eat this girl . &quot;
but it &apos;s the best thing that happens , because what is called the pressure , peer peer-to-peer patient -- patient tells when it comes to being obese , it can be used for patients to use the patient .
on the other hand , it &apos;s used to pull people out of the seat in the game that are engaged in a better game to control their health control .
in a week , i &apos;m going soon .
that &apos;s your blood pressure with your iphone or something else .
and each of you may be at home in your home , send the data in the doctor , even though i can share it with other people to consider that $ 100 dollars .
and this is the point where the patient from control and control of health data , not only to control their own control for their own sake , but also for us to take care of our health care challenges that we face for the health care challenges that we face for the health care , we need to deliver health and well-being at the level of health .
it &apos;s easy to start using technology and start with them to ease comfortably control of the patients in patients .
and you &apos;re not just going to do with these kinds of technologies like this , but it &apos;s not going to look at the solutions . &quot;
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done to do with a tiny little demo .
we all have gps in the car .
we even have it in the phone .
we know exactly the actual code in the  UNK  city .
another other thing we know about all the gas stations .
and sure that we can find the bananas bananas store .
but in the most remote cochlear implant to allow this patient to help patients ?
we asked them around and nobody knows .
nobody knows where the most  UNK  device is saving lives .
and this is what we did , we used to use the crowd in the dutch .
we set up a video chat and ask , &quot; if you see a  UNK  device , sends emails , sends it to information that we know where it works when we treat it , because sometimes it doesn &apos;t work .
and 10,000 than the  UNK  device famously found found and discovered .
the next step we found the app for it .
and we built an app on the ipad app ipad .
we do a  UNK  augmented application augmented reality to discover this device .
and anytime anytime you &apos;re in a city like a city where you &apos;ve met someone with your iphone -- your iphone , and for a few weeks , i can run on your smartphone app on the internet today to be able to find the latest best possible life that can save lives .
and today we &apos;re going to introduce this device is not just a product .
and we wanted to start this detector around the world .
we &apos;ve all looked at all colleagues everywhere in the world , in universities , to allow us to work , and work acting as a center of information to information about information around the world .
whenever you go on vacation , there &apos;s a member of your friends , or someone in front of them , don &apos;t you find a  UNK  device .
another other thing we &apos;re really hoping for help is all over the world can help us manage this device .
these companies can be  UNK  services service provider , for example , just for sure that these devices are equipped to send information about it .
so let &apos;s help us do this and not only do better health .
thank you .
i &apos;m here to share with my photography .
is it a photography photography ?
since , this is photography photography that you can &apos;t have cameras .
my interest of my photography started when i started a video camera at the age of 15 .
it became obsessed with my art , but a little bit different , because a camera , the project was planning .
and when you use the camera , take the process off the table .
so photography with my photography as humorous as being true , right .
i felt like anybody could do that .
so i want to make a difference , something that starts in the process .
but eight images like this : happening to occur across the road .
but it &apos;s a no-brainer .
and it &apos;s fair , it &apos;s authentic .
take these pictures like this -- i both color and color , but with all of them : the sheer appreciation of awareness .
when i talk authentic authentic authentic , i mean authentic .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually have , but i always wanted it to be in a way a way .
the pictures that you &apos;re going to need some time to figure out a figure out .
so it &apos;s actually a novel idea of idea .
what is the secret to make it look like ?
is it a little bit of detail about the color or color ?
is it a little bit ?
what caused the hallucinations ?
sometimes make a hallucinations .
but at the end of it , how do we take the world and how we see it on a surface .
it &apos;s not real real , it &apos;s what we think it &apos;s real .
so i think the fundamental things are quite simple .
i just show it is the reality of the fact that you can actually take different parts of reality , and they actually create a reality of reality .
let me show you a simple example .
we have three objects in trying to get the perfect architecture , but we can all relate to the physical world in the space .
but in some ways , they make something like that , it &apos;s like that .
but for a while , we know is impossible .
so we invite the brain to the brain , because the simplest brain is that we don &apos;t accept the factors that actually claim to be realistic .
and i found that the combination of them together as a process .
that &apos;s actually just a different combination of reality .
so what makes you picture in real life , i think , is the things that we never have to think about , the day in the day in our everyday life around the day .
but when combining these pictures , here &apos;s something really important , because if you don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be fine .
so i want to give three basic principles principles in order to get the results .
as you can see here , these pictures are in a particular place .
but again , they can create something like this .
so the first principle is that the combination of pictures should have a bronze .
secondly , and you can create a kind of light .
and these two pictures are both satisfy the conditions -- and the same is at the same , same same same .
the third principle is that it really was in a place where there were weird different sets of trips and begin to finish them into the circuits .
it &apos;s hard to say how to create create images .
so in contrast by color , contrast contrast and light the boundaries between different images , in the sphere , as you can see the conditions as the field of the field , and the field is exploding , and we see that there are  UNK  in the middle of each other .
so here &apos;s an example .
someone could think that this is just a landscape and the landscape in the main milk .
these pictures have been totally different by images from each other .
and i think that &apos;s more easy to create more than to create the context context , rather than because context , but because you don &apos;t need to organize the idea anymore .
but it really requires a lot of planning .
and there was this idea in the winter , because i knew i had to lose some months to prepare , for different locations .
for example , fish are caught in the sphere .
the shoreline is somewhere else .
underneath the water is made of them .
and again , i even put my home on the island of  UNK  than in sweden .
so let &apos;s get a real value , i think it comes to planning .
there is always a conversation with an idea , a idea .
and that &apos;s another combination of different images .
and here , the parts are fine .
and if you &apos;re good at photographs , photography can be great , and it &apos;s quite well .
all the tools are right here , and the only thing is that our limitations is the wall .
thank you .
this seems counterintuitive , but i &apos;m a concrete fan of lumpy tiles .
but from the very first brick into the concrete jungle with a very simple idea : simple air from the  UNK  with  UNK  structures .
but the quickly had found a new material that was built in the most affluent parts of the world .
they allow us to build bigger than ourselves , ourselves , buildings , bridge .
maybe we have a  UNK  concrete .
after a hundred years , in 1947 , . introduced this thing .
it &apos;s called  UNK  .
and just in short , short , the lego institute has been at the same time .
in a nutshell , there &apos;s 400 more 400 million dollars , which is made out of 75 or 5,000 dollars per people on the earth .
you don &apos;t need to engineer an engineer to build the beautiful building block , beautiful beauty , or beautiful buildings .
lego has done it .
the lego was taken away from the concrete , and the building block out of the world , and it made it into bricks &apos;s imaginations .
in the main year , at the bell labs , the next revolution was going to be published in the next generation of stars .
transistors is a plastic combination of plastic that are going to take us from the  UNK  bricks from the world up to the world that &apos;s interact with each other .
it &apos;s like the bricks hadron collider allows you to build a large sample and complicated circuit , which is a  UNK  bricks .
but there is a big difference : just a professional
personally , i don &apos;t accept this , that the machines have happened in the modern republic of professionals , so i decided to change it .
eight years ago when i was in the study of a media lab , i discovered that there was an idea to figure out how to engineer and engineering designers .
a few years ago i started developed  UNK  .
let me show you how this works .
UNK  is the electronics with other components functions .
they were designed to turn off the light , the sound , and the motor .
and the most exciting thing about them is that they &apos;re tiny .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
the &quot; brick &quot; brick &quot; tape recorders .
the green is , green , electricity , is the input and  UNK  .
so the things you need to do is green to green and blue is very quickly , and you can quickly know where you can do bigger and bigger .
you &apos;re blue dark blue , you can actually make a circuit .
you give a spin spin between the wind and now you can shine light up to the light .
see spinning ice sheets , like this , and now you &apos;ve got a  UNK  demo .
more recently , this electrical layer and you &apos;ve created video games .
i &apos;m going to go .
as you can see , it &apos;s not just easy to play a piece of music .
instead of going to program , , let &apos;s talk about circuit , he demos the circuit boards , allows you to translate the visual function .
to make the  UNK  hopping or faster or slower , you can just calculate the levers and change the pace .
the idea behind this is what it looks like .
we want to integrate all sorts of interaction in the world . &quot;
light , light , the solar cells , the engine -- everything can get access .
we &apos;ve funded  UNK  kids and watch them to play with .
and that &apos;s an amazing experience .
the best thing about is that kids who started to understand understand their electronics every day around the electronics that they &apos;re not learning in school .
so , for example , how work works , why is an automatic automatic license ,  UNK   UNK  , reactive firing commands .
we also  UNK  our desks to teach design courses .
so , for example , we have these designers that are completely unaware of  UNK  , with elevators .
and here you &apos;re going to see , with some paper , and the bottle ,  UNK  rocks ...
a couple of weeks ago we introduced to risd and peer them , not just a design experience with technology , with wood , and paper -- and told them how to do that . &quot;
this is an example of project that they &apos;ve made , making  UNK   UNK  .
wait , wait , this is my favorite project .
it &apos;s a rice of land , and it &apos;s scared of dark .
for those of engineers ,  UNK  became a new type of material , which became a new material .
and we wanted to make this approach .
so the  UNK  is a project .
you can go to the website , download designers and design from them .
we want to world our world , innovators , inventors and others , because this world , world , world , where we live in this world , in this world , is this .
let &apos;s go ahead and start .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s at the german end of spain , if you had a typewriter that would you have to stick with the government .
not only that , you have to register a document that &apos;s extracted from the typewriter .
the goal of this goal is to be able to get the source of source material .
if the officer came out with these ideas , they don &apos;t actually choose to go to the  UNK  of these ideas . &quot;
and we , in west , we can &apos;t understand understand why that can be the fact that when the enemy is the freedom of speech .
we &apos;re never going to do that in our countries .
but today , at the moment of this in 2011 , if you have a rain from any type of production , and you &apos;ve got a copy of print , and if you &apos;ve got a press to print a page , which is a piece of paper that &apos;s labeled in the sample of the original paper that &apos;s printed on top of the print and you printed them on this page , you can actually pick up with a copy of print .
this is happening with them today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be loud . &quot;
this is an example of how the government of us are using against technology , against our nation .
and this is also true one of three main sets of problems .
look at what &apos;s actually happening in the world , world , we can classify attacks based on the attacks .
there are three sources .
from criminals online criminals .
like here , we have  UNK   UNK  from downtown from kiev , from kiev .
and the motivation of this network is very simple and understandable .
earn !
they use engaging online activities to earn a lot of money , lots of money .
a few of examples of  UNK  comes from the world people who can get their money from attacks .
this is the  UNK   UNK  coming from estonia .
alfred  UNK  .
stephen watts .
bjorn  UNK  .
he &apos;s  UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  and so on , etc .
they &apos;re finding the wealth of activities , through ways to use  UNK  attacks for the banking system to steal our goods from our online banking tables , or even to send them to the software that allow them to deliver the computer security services that allow us to receive the information from the  UNK  .
the united states , two months ago , two months before the swiss bank accounts of jain , mr. jain , with 84 million dollars in his account at the same time .
he was hiding ; and he doesn &apos;t know where he was .
and i &apos;m saying that today we risk to become the victims of our ordinary lives in this real world .
and the obvious truth is that these risks are getting worse .
in the future , the vast majority of illegal  UNK  will occur in the world .
the second one that we &apos;re facing today is not saving for money .
they &apos;re funded because other purposes -- the opposition government , disagreement , sometimes and sometimes it &apos;s fun .
groups like anonymous failed , and they became a very important force in this game .
so we have three groups of  UNK  : to justify the criminal justice , and as they like to resist the government , and our government is the government , our governments .
there &apos;s a lot of cases like what happened in  UNK  .
this is a great example of what happens when the government attacks against their own .
teeb is a company that allowed to come from the dutch -- or at least they &apos;ve ever been .
they had to last fall in 1990 last year because of their own signature .
anyone had broken into the system and it completely completely .
at the last week , in a meeting with the dutch government , i had a question to ask for a question that they had to do whether or not whether or not if someone had to attack a death attack because of attack attacks .
and she said , &quot; you reply .
how do this attack attack ?
UNK  is a service provider service provider .
they sold just security .
what do you do with those ?
in fact , you need a platform to if you have a website or a website with  UNK  service , services , services that service services .
all of our , or least most of us are using a or app or another app , and this particular kind of service in particular countries like iran , where pundits says , the political coalitions that are going to employ , or whether they &apos;re going to use a separate fee , because they &apos;re going to use wikipedia from the service of politics , because they know from the politics of politics , and they &apos;re more hiring legal services , and they &apos;re more interested in the service of politics and services , and they
but everything else , if the government could get to the databases .
and i coined the forgery .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens to happen .
so the arab spring and arab spring occurred in ireland ?
in egypt , when the riot of the federal reserve police dropped egypt in 2011 .
in that , there &apos;s documents called &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
in this document that file from a company headquarters in the u.k. government who has a lot of engineering government high-tech tools to get a large scale on a large scale of all the size of the scale and its scope .
they &apos;ve been selling these tools for egyptians to  UNK  .
this is my main headquarters company .
so the western governments are providing governments to the government tools to bring their tools .
but the western governments do that day in our country .
for example , germany in several weeks ago , people had discovered  UNK   UNK  , which was a  UNK  type of workers who were using german schooling to express their people .
if you &apos;re trying to get involved in a crime , which is the thing that your phone is . &quot;
but it doesn &apos;t just stop there .
they hear their stories on the internet .
they &apos;re even going to use tools like  UNK   UNK  to get computers into your computer , and that they can have access to information , and you have conversations conversations with your password , and you &apos;ve got your password .
but it &apos;s going to take a look at this problem , okay , &quot; oh , it sounds nice , but it doesn &apos;t matter what i mean because i &apos;m a citizen citizen .
so why am i worried ?
i &apos;m not completely  UNK  .
these arguments is straightforward .
privacy is  UNK  .
the  UNK  need to have dissent .
this is not the middle of privacy and security security .
this is a problem between freedom and control .
and while we still believe in the day government , right now , in this year , that this year is that every single one of us that every aspect of our rights is lost better .
and if we have trust , one way in the future , any government that we can have 50 years ?
that &apos;s the question that we &apos;re going to ask for the next 50 years .
