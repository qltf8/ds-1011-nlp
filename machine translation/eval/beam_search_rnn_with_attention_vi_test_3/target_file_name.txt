we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
so now what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
we recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
in fact , so lacking in confidence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs.  UNK  , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
then finally she said , &quot; the third thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
that our input to the system of government is voting .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
it says , &apos; this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
so to achieve a realistic result , i think it comes down to planning .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the  UNK  .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
so in these plans , we had about  UNK  plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings .
now in the financial savings world , i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david  UNK  was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at harvard .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow scott  UNK  did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an  UNK  stuck in your house .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , &quot; i came into this  UNK  to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of  UNK  .
suppose you have  UNK  and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s batting 400 on  UNK  .
but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
we still think it is pristine .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
and every now and then ms.  UNK  would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot;  UNK  , ms. parks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
all right .
and they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
solar technology is ...
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot;  UNK  , do you still feel me  UNK  you ? &quot;
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
groups like anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
how well do you think you &apos;re doing at managing those choices ?
they &apos;re  UNK  to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
there were remixes .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
and i went back to work .
i was an  UNK   UNK  student .
over here , these are the  UNK  .
we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the  UNK  of your province .
because it &apos;s in that  UNK  that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
if i were to walk into a room filled with my  UNK  and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i &apos;ve just told you right now , i probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
legendary -- as in ted williams legendary -- the last major league baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
we there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam , and we looked at two things : first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some jam ?
we &apos;re taking off .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
and they found that the average ceo engaged in about  UNK  tasks in a week .
the unhealthy shame i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
so what happens here ?
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
so the question i have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an  UNK  , a  UNK  is supposed to be ?
i spend most of my time in very low-income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness .
they were maturing at five centimeters .
now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category ?
they had  UNK  different kinds of jam .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
and then it happened again .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . &quot;
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
car colors , exterior car colors -- i &apos;ve got 56 choices .
so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
no .
because i have nothing to hide . &quot;
but , but , you know what ?
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
and he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
and i claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
one of two things is going to happen .
and there they make great apps , they work with city  UNK  .
and as i was walking up the steps of this  UNK  , there was an older black man who was the janitor in this  UNK  .
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
that means hit the ball into the  UNK  , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the runner was safe .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
and i felt really good .
and i &apos;d like you to read it .
i was terrified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me , without tweeting it to my friends .
thank you .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
but there &apos;s another thing .
and i memorized everything .
and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the baseline .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
i was in the desert , under the starry skies with the sufi singer  UNK  ali .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they  UNK  .
but combined , they can create something like this .
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
and i did well , i graduated with honors ,  UNK   UNK  .
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about 70 in a typical day .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
and the nurse thought about it and said very  UNK  , &quot; yeah , i think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
so every morning i hop on my wifi scale and before i &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; i think you need a light lunch today ,  UNK  . &quot;
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
so it says , &quot; place your fingers upon each light . &quot;
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
and that &apos;s nothing .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
my  UNK  again .
in one , i was the classic asian student , relentless in the demands that i made on myself .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so now for the topic of today : financial savings .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different .
the u.s. secret service , two months ago , froze the swiss bank account of mr. sam jain right here , and that bank account had  UNK  million u.s. dollars on it when it was frozen .
that means that  UNK   UNK  safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
it might take a moment to load .
and the snippets of  UNK  english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .
my mother ,  UNK  , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24 .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch .
score them again .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the  UNK  tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
and i was  UNK  from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
this may sound strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and  UNK  her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
so now we &apos;ve  UNK  up the time scales once again .
and i studied in my little  UNK  at the nurses &apos; residence at toronto general hospital , not far from here .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
i have talked about four techniques for  UNK  the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives ;  UNK  -- make it real ; categorize -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
in both cases , these are gross  UNK  , because we really aren &apos;t  UNK  out the problem as we should .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
but today , it goes beyond that .
i couldn &apos;t bear it .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
that could be shoveling out a hydrant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an  UNK  in it .
it would be so  UNK  and so empowering .
they had to worry about being bombed .
and so -- it says , &quot; this box belongs to ... &quot; and so i type in my name .
all of these techniques that i &apos;m describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving .
UNK  are electronic modules with each one specific function .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
we actually have several cases of millionaires online ,  UNK  , who made money with their attacks .
you know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , i &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
and during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
and i &apos;d say , &quot; yes , ma &apos;am , i do . &quot;
i don &apos;t take the same history .
each task was made up of many , many , many  UNK  of course .
now we see the opposite effect .
i do get tired , as we all do .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
well i was nine years old , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
so beyond simple play ,  UNK  are actually pretty powerful .
lego made it accessible .
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
we settled in  UNK  , a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immunize me against making mistakes .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .
she grew up at a time when  UNK  was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
i represent people on death row .
so for my first question for you today : are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem ?
and i was shocked and  UNK  to the core .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not settle into a career in law .
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary .
i &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
he died broken by history .
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
the main reason for this is because , we might enjoy  UNK  at those giant walls of  UNK  ,  UNK  ,  UNK  , jams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of comparing and  UNK  and actually picking from that stunning display .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
well there are opportunities all around us .
and it &apos;s that  UNK  connection that i believe  UNK  us to not just be  UNK  to all the bright and  UNK  things , but also the dark and difficult things .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , i guess ,  UNK  is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
we work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage , where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous , causing havoc and death .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
i said , &quot; well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
the second mistake that i made was worse .
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on  UNK  curves .
at midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the  UNK  .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been  UNK  and released from death row .
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
now as i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to have some questions for you and i &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
and let me close with three words of my own : i do remember .
thank you .
and whenever you are in a city like  UNK  and somebody collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks also run your microsoft cellphone , to find the nearest  UNK  which can save lives .
because i was there in &apos; 71 , studying a  UNK  in west africa .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
and what i &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
my male uncles died of  UNK  diseases .
every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a  UNK  fund .
and that &apos;s important .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
but i carried on with my work .
and every morning i hop on it .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
the shores are from a different location .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd-sourcing .
my fourth technique : condition for complexity .
so you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in literate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
we have seven million people on  UNK  and  UNK  .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file .
and then seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify  UNK   UNK   UNK  .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
and there is this stunning silence .
and what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan , the 401 plan , does that affect people &apos;s likelihood to save more for tomorrow .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
something  UNK  inside me .
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
what does this mean ?
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
and over 10,000  UNK  already in the netherlands already have been submitted .
but that &apos;s the nicest thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the world series .
and yeah , i even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more swedish .
she said , &quot; the first thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
imagine him as the communists enter  UNK  , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
huh . hang on a moment .
what am i going to look at ?
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of  UNK  will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act .
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
we &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
when i say  UNK  , i mean  UNK  .
this is stephen watt .
fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000  UNK  to impose on them industrial fishing .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
on my show , on &quot; white coat , black art , &quot; i made it a habit of saying , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from  UNK  to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about yours ? &quot; and i would point the microphone towards them .
jimmy  UNK  actually .
and then we look at cases like what happened in  UNK  .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; oh , i hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . &quot;
they stopped us from being inspired .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
we have our cognitive biases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
if you generalize this , something like this happens .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .
i tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii .
and i think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
and so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of dna .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
in the &apos; 70s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 60s -- europe did lots of development projects .
slowly but surely , it lifted .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are  UNK  by crime , not do less .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have  UNK  us .
i am a redefined physician .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
and i went through the same period of shame and  UNK  and felt  UNK  and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; if you see an  UNK  , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
it could happen in learning time scales .
they &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied , even when they do objectively better .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
and it had  UNK  about 20 centimeters , a species of  UNK  called  UNK   UNK  .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
and these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
jimmy  UNK  posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
i was devastated .
and over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
you can have a succession of changes .
UNK  software usually takes a couple of years .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
mr. jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
because evolution could now happen within an individual .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an  UNK  free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world .
so a study that i did with  UNK   UNK  and alessandro  UNK  , we did a study with people at  UNK  -- employees that are all working at  UNK  -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing  UNK  for their 401 plan .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
three things :  UNK  , communities of participation and  UNK  .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
you can google it , but it &apos;s an infection , not of the throat , but of the upper  UNK  , and it can actually cause the  UNK  to close .
UNK  ,  UNK  !
he retreated into silence .
well you need a certificate if you have a website that has  UNK  ,  UNK  encrypted services , services like gmail .
they tell me to say , &quot; no , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
and you will have noticed that the  UNK  and tones are like &quot; avatar . &quot;
have you seen these guys ?
and i had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
and i think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
i &apos;m sorry about that , but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
in fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; i will bypass you . &quot;
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
but it &apos;s not documented .
UNK  , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
and because i was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
it can know where we are .
and so over here you need to tilt your ipad , take the fireflies out .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
one i thought had a kidney stone .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
and then at my worst moments : why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes , sir . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their  UNK  , and the children inherit the traits of the  UNK  of the two programs .
more people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
and his answer was yes .
the more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
this is a chart of what it looked like .
so lunch is coming along , and i think i will stop at that point , before i get selected out .
it was called the automatic binding brick .
and similar to &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to have just  UNK  up out of nowhere .
and it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult , to see that patient in  UNK  .
this is not a finished story .
we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
now in fact , you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in  UNK  and sat around her  UNK  .
how engaged you are .
and that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to be talking about .
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; there &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
wealth , not  UNK  , shapes outcomes .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
but in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extraneous redundant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lowering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience .
and you saw  UNK  &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the  UNK  program right before your eyes .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; come on ,  UNK  . you and i are going to have a talk . &quot;
i gave her my whole rap , and when i finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; mmm mmm mmm . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , i have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
and she &apos;d squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
it &apos;s true .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of  UNK  feeling inside my stomach .
there are billions of them .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a  UNK  resident .
last year , bear  UNK  posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park .
we &apos;re losing them .
well she was back all right .
so &quot;  UNK  cat &quot; is a  UNK  animation with  UNK  music .
thank you .
now i &apos;m an optimist , so i sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
if i show you 600 magazines and i divide them up into 10 categories , versus i show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the 400 than if i gave you the 600 .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
so i &apos;m just going to enter in .
and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court .
and it &apos;s interesting , when i teach my students about african-american history , i tell them about slavery .
now in order to do that i &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
we &apos;re going through the same levels that  UNK  organisms have gone through --  UNK  out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
i said , &quot; no , i don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;all go ahead . y &apos;all go ahead . &quot;
what does it mean ?
and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by  UNK  and decades of racial  UNK  and apartheid .
in this country , as many as 24,000 canadians die of preventable medical errors .
my mother phoned minutes later .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; well you know it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
turned  UNK  on its side . walked home .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
this is the work of the very smart people at the office of new urban mechanics in boston .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
it connected those two people .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and i went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and i hoped against hope that she would recover .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
save those . kill off the rest .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
here &apos;s vladimir  UNK  form  UNK  in estonia .
if we were captured , first my sister and i , then she and my grandmother would drink .
that whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collapses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
today , there are 2.3 million .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
and i thought about that .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called state  UNK  was found , which was a  UNK  used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
say , &quot; computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
we have life imprisonment without  UNK  for kids in this country .
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
this is a simulation of  UNK  bay .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
it can know how we &apos;re holding it .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
there were still  UNK  .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
i said , &quot; okay , mama . &quot;
the typical walmart today offers you 100,000 products .
so for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine aisle .
but for african-americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
they had sold this tool for  UNK  euros to the egyptian government .
why didn &apos;t i ask my attending ? why did i send her home ?
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
and then my brother started staring at me .
but i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to admit to you that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or  UNK  is supposed to bat .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
thank you .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
when i was a child , i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and  UNK  and shells .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
so i signed the discharge papers , and an ambulance came ,  UNK  came to take her home .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
rebecca black &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
so what happened here ?
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m quite sure that he  UNK  things over and made sure that i didn &apos;t get sued .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
we have three main groups .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you &apos;re considering their future financial well-being .
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
we would never do that in our own countries .
i talk a lot about these issues .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best  UNK  .
and to report back to my attending .
they &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space .
now we do the same with airplanes .
say , &quot; please repeat that process . &quot;
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have  UNK  making ...
they &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
and i go to the jail and i see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
and at that stage , we have  UNK  communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were  UNK  encouraged .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
this is a dead turtle .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
i think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
goodnight sweet  UNK  . &quot;
they &apos;re using their hands .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
so the system is evolving to create  UNK  that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also  UNK  in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean .
it would be  UNK  for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about  UNK  people . &quot;
so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the  UNK  health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times , but were  UNK  by the  UNK  of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
and i think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
so when i ask you a question , since i &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories .
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &quot;
and he whispered in my ear .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
a few weeks ago we took  UNK  to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; make something . &quot;
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
UNK  .
here &apos;s their jam aisle .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be  UNK  about choosing .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qualifications .
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are  UNK  that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to clap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take gary up on his offer .
okay , a bit more .
and somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
okay .
over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
for a year we were penniless .
we were poor .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
but this has in it -- what i did is i took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for  UNK  it -- and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it 10 to the 22 times .
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
is it something about the light ?
and ms. parks used to come back to  UNK  every now and then , and she would get together with two of her  UNK  friends , these older women ,  UNK   UNK  who was the organizer of the  UNK  bus  UNK  -- amazing african-american woman -- and virginia  UNK  , a white woman , whose husband ,  UNK   UNK  , represented dr. king .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
if i were to walk into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
it &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
and so i did .
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot;  UNK  cat ? &quot;
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz , clap your hands .
and chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows .
except they can if they hack into a foreign  UNK
then she said , &quot; the second thing i want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
and she &apos;s hitting a  UNK  .
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed  UNK  report that &apos;s a response to the sec &apos;s request for comment on the financial reform bill .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline .
well it was a friday , this is true .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call  UNK  in your city .
they sell certificates .
i looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
you know , often , people say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor  UNK  back and forth .
he was actually collecting fish .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device .
michael j. nelson from mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter .
she said , &quot; now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the  UNK  , be perfect .
i sometimes push too hard .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
and i started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14-year-old black male client like a privileged , white  UNK  corporate executive . &quot;
pretty simple .
and i got a big  UNK  , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
otherwise , when i ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , i &apos;d like you to clap your hands .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the  UNK  &apos;s .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with  UNK  as a material .
good , really good , maybe an  UNK  .
a child in london puts up a picture of a fox and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox today . &quot;
back then , when  UNK  , the great indian warrior prince , when he was thirsty , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
there was also recently a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole week .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution .
but you know what ?
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire  UNK  .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so confusing .
the idea behind  UNK  is that it &apos;s a growing library .
why did i go into medicine ?
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to ted .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
her mother raised her alone .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
and there were rare but searing  UNK  of &quot;  UNK  &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
the three words are : do you remember ?
but the ninth largest  UNK  , the ninth biggest  UNK  in the world today is  UNK  , and it offers you only 1,400 products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce .
and so my recommendation , it &apos;s the only one i will provide , is for cameron to do &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
and the more  UNK  i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
i still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
i &apos;m human . i make mistakes .
it &apos;s called batting average .
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic  UNK  like depth of field ,  UNK  colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
and so i jumped in , i jumped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
you have on the y axis some good thing : biodiversity , numbers of  UNK  , the  UNK  of your country , the water supply .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
and that means  UNK  , it means open , it means generative .
and when i listened to her chest with a stethoscope , i could hear  UNK  sounds on both sides that told me that she was in  UNK  heart failure .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
storytelling is becoming more and more  UNK  .
my name is brian goldman .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
it &apos;s not just code for america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have  UNK  of breath .
i met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
there was an energy there , an  UNK  optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started  UNK  out .
and for that work , when i was a final year law student , i was chosen as the young australian of the year .
and i made myself a bargain that if only i  UNK  my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
this mountain of debris is actually collected by  UNK  every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fished .
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little  UNK  .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
i personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so i decided to change that .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of  UNK  microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
and i think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
i &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
now we do the same with drills and machines .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
they were still kind of happy .
they sort of go like this .
i ordered some fluids to  UNK  him and asked my colleague to  UNK  him .
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the  UNK  layer on top .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
but so many over the years were helped .
i spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row .
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
all the adults knew the risks .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the  UNK  voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and when i listened to her , she was making a  UNK  sound .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this  UNK  of beer -- i don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i &apos;m talking about .
lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
and i put my challenge on 95  UNK  .
it &apos;s a  UNK  made of  UNK  that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
the bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy mess .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a gotcha way , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody can benefit .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
UNK  is a certificate authority from the netherlands -- or actually , it was .
but what are we doing with it ?
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
here i have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
now the fish is on the iucn red list .
and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into  UNK  organisms .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
so we &apos;re the  UNK  and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
for example , here in california we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . i &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
and i put in my motion that there was  UNK   UNK  and police  UNK  and judicial  UNK  .
yeah ,  UNK  , the judge has some magic power .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , glued to their  UNK  , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
defeat would have come too easily .
so that worked . so  UNK  for scott .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
well i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; mr.  UNK  , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
but where would be the nearest  UNK  to help this patient ?
a school uniform down to the ankles , because it had to last for six years .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a  UNK  brick .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very  UNK  to me .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
it &apos;s not our problem .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
and i &apos;m going to admit something to you .
and then it went international .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours ms. parks turned to me and she said , &quot; now  UNK  , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
i don &apos;t say that because i think that &apos;s virtuous ; i say that because there is power in identity .
and it &apos;s collected by my general practitioner as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that i need  UNK  support or something like it , but also looking backward .
others in medicine dread them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so  UNK  .
now i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
so what we did , we  UNK  the netherlands .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where i &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i &apos;m going to talk to you about .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
in sending her home , i  UNK  a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the  UNK  behind the house .
all right , let &apos;s go .
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the  UNK  projects fail , since we stopped listening .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a  UNK  curve .
i lived in parallel worlds .
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was an irresistible challenge .
at various points , a little letter drops down to me -- and the ipad knows where you live because of gps -- which is actually addressed to me .
i found myself becoming a little bit of a  UNK  .
and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
we love entertainment .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
and the fisheries for this  UNK  sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in ghana .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
i have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
thank you very much .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
they &apos;re more likely to delay choosing --  UNK  even when it goes against their best self-interest .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the  UNK  .
because the transition seems very , very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
and those are the neural structures .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
and this boat , quite ugly , is called the  UNK  4 .
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
i memorized in my anatomy class the origins and  UNK  of every muscle , every branch of every artery that came off the aorta , differential diagnoses obscure and common .
they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
thank you .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
it was a store called  UNK  &apos;s .
they become rarer because we fish them .
we worked well into each night .
and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
so back in the day , when us indians wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a chariot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
and that was my first time to be  UNK  with that .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and so what i &apos;m trying to ask , what i &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
so go ahead and start inventing .
now i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
some of my  UNK  have been in the last five years .
so let me recap .
my brother said , &quot; come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
because it  UNK  something that in a sense has been lost .
vaclav  UNK  , the great  UNK  leader , talked about this .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
my grandfather was in prison during  UNK  .
i don &apos;t believe that .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
something really weird is going on here .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
and to my horror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple  UNK  of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of  UNK  took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
thank you very much .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
we love technology . we love creativity .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
and you make  UNK  and you never make that mistake again .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
instead , what i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
one of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the ipad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , justin bieber , got his start on youtube .
how could we help you ? &quot;
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after mrs.  UNK  before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians i know dread .
i &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
a big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
i gave her medications that we call  UNK  , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
this is alfred  UNK  .
the  UNK  still say it is untouched .
they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
at the time i was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation .
i &apos;m going to focus on one  UNK  that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
but the point is , we still come to galapagos .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
as some of you might know , i &apos;ve got more than 4,000 followers on twitter .
and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks .
i didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a  UNK  and opened another business .
it &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
in the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your ipad out with the video on and through augmented reality , you see this layer of animated  UNK  appear on a  UNK  that &apos;s outside your house .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
i &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment .
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
wooo !
this is a modest little app .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
so those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money ,  UNK  like anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
he was placed on  UNK  antibiotics and he recovered after a few days .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
and the more we &apos;re able to be  UNK  about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . friday , friday .  UNK  &apos; down on friday . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
and i think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward .
and so when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world .
and i thought about it and i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
my third little story is that i was an  UNK  in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia .
can i give them a bow in their lives ,  UNK  bravely into each wave , the  UNK  and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarantees nothing ?
so i &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch  UNK  , an interactive app for the ipad .
they &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
he kept  UNK  back and forth .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
well in egypt , the  UNK   UNK  the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
thank you .
he types &quot;  UNK  &quot; into this official knowledge base .
i never knew him in real life .
and that &apos;s when ms.  UNK  leaned forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave , brave , brave . &quot;
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleague universities , to help us to find and work and act like a hub to  UNK  all these  UNK  all around the world .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it &apos;s because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot;  UNK  . &quot;
we made an application for  UNK  , augmented reality , to find these  UNK  .
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a  UNK   UNK   UNK  ball .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- mrs.  UNK  , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
well i went into the  UNK  .
this is bjorn  UNK  .
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a  UNK  throat .
to these  UNK  ,  UNK  became another material , electronics became just another material .
how do i get this removed ? &quot;
and this is about shifting baseline .
and i don &apos;t mean wizards and dragons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all  UNK  as children .
now i &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
so how does it happen ?
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
how about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the midwest for example ?
i said , &quot; well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
i mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
now in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and i don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
and despite that , it  UNK  a level of  UNK  .
and it was what i was feeling .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &quot;
tan le , anonymous  UNK  resident , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
it was  UNK  to her that she would not succeed .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of choices .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game .
if there is a  UNK  in our family , it runs through the women .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
in many communities , people had to worry about being  UNK  .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down .
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
so  UNK  is open-source .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
and i began giving her my rap .
and if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the  UNK  story -- why so touched by the imagery ?
so for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and let me show you a simple example .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
well  UNK  picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
she took me out back and she said , &quot;  UNK  , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what i tell you . &quot;
i told my mother i couldn &apos;t do it .
this is happening to us today .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
he kept pointing here .
at the end you want to sustain miserable  UNK  .
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
and i was up too late one night and i starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an atm card or a credit card as opposed to cash ?
we love innovation .
now i work in the solar technology industry .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
she shares her experience with others .
and what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .
so here &apos;s another example .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
and he knew her , he would have been able to  UNK  additional information about her .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a  UNK  .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in  UNK  by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
and it opens up a map .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
a few years ago i started developing  UNK  .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
and he pointed to the  UNK  of tourists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
this is my wifi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over  UNK  connections , so the local government can &apos;t  UNK  on their discussions .
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in  UNK  with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
if i had really been a  UNK  , i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the  UNK  .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs.  UNK  .
and one of the things we did at  UNK  university is we appointed a chief listening officer .
in the 1980s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
and i &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total  UNK
you &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
when i would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hugs .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow  UNK  into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
and we say that word with such contempt .
and also , tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
they go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re hanging in there .
twice in one emergency shift , i missed  UNK  .
so those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egyptian government a set of tools for  UNK  -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
and i thought i could blend in .
nobody knew where the nearest life-saving  UNK  was to be obtained right now .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were  UNK  .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
people seem to think politics is sexy .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
now this store , it was almost like going to an amusement park .
these might be  UNK  services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the  UNK  that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
and she &apos;d say , &quot; well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african-american home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
and these women would get together and just talk .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
three months later i had  UNK  , and the adventure has continued .
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being  UNK  active .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this  UNK  , geeky internet culture .
in the other , i was  UNK  in lives that were  UNK  , tragically  UNK  by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
we &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
1,000 , very good .
&quot; moneyball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
and the  UNK  was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few mangrove .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like a peace corps for geeks .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just skip -- i &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ...
all the dollars were allocated and extra  UNK  in english and mathematics was  UNK  for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always  UNK  .
i sometimes get out of balance . i &apos;ll end with this story .
we &apos;re trying to end life without  UNK  sentences for children .
well  UNK  is a  UNK
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and i asked the manager , &quot; is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
so meet al .
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the  UNK  throat ? &quot;
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
came into the  UNK  and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .
but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an  UNK  institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
he had a potentially life-threatening condition called  UNK  .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking  UNK  to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with  UNK  to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
so when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i used to go to this very , very  UNK  grocery store ; at least at that time it was truly  UNK  .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
at 17 she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
the second story , also to illustrate another concept , is called shifting  UNK  .
i &apos;m going to tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t .
and actually i become a character in the book .
well after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about  UNK  .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that i &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after i &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 911 and the  UNK  brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
and you &apos;d think he was chasing  UNK  , but he wasn &apos;t .
she had irreversible brain damage .
he is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
and here &apos;s the thing .
there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exclusion , to  UNK  , to injustice .
now if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
telephony , computers ,  UNK  ,  UNK  and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
and they did .
and i didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
it became a  UNK  gateway into a world full of pirates and  UNK  and images in my imagination .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
all right , let me show you some more about this .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
alone , ashamed and  UNK  .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our  UNK  -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions .
writing down the dna was an interesting step .
they will tap your internet connection .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
the first : cut .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
and before i knew it , the  UNK  was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot;  UNK  in my  UNK  . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the earth was this big , sterile  UNK  of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
so i &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
now why do we draw technology curves in  UNK  curves ?
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
when the golden cat corporation got rid of their 10  UNK  cat litter products , they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs .
we transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; swing . &quot;
and the  UNK  staff pulled out all the stops .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
so if you look at the extremes , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the  UNK  -- still not as high as we want it to be .
thank you very much .
in another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
so we &apos;ve all heard about fairies and we &apos;ve all heard about  UNK  , but how many people outside of india know about their indian counterparts , the  UNK  ?
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
privacy is not up for discussion .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
my state of alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently  UNK  you if you have a criminal conviction .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? have some beer . &quot;
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epic &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
someone made an old  UNK  version .
now take the same patient with chest pain , make them moist and  UNK  and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath , and suddenly my history is  UNK  with contempt .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and the family gathered .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
now if i graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a  UNK  curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison .
the third technique :  UNK  .
instead of having to program , to wire , to  UNK  ,  UNK  allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the  UNK  time scale .
i used to love going to this store , but on one occasion i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were in a locked case that came from  UNK  olive trees .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four  UNK  , to 56 car colors , high choice .
and therefore they &apos;re not perceived as a big loss .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
we have online criminals .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
and there &apos;s nothing  UNK  in the history of technology development of this kind of  UNK  growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
he said , &quot; oh , mama tells all the grandkids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
do you know what they call a 300  UNK  in major league baseball ?
we &apos;ve also been taking  UNK  to design schools .
i began to feel a bit better .
it &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
i never will forget it .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
in the united states , the institute of medicine  UNK  it at 100,000 .
and i got in my car and i went to this  UNK  .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
but i do remember the lights on the oil rig off the  UNK  coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple i tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
for example , the anecdote that some present , as captain  UNK  observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever i hop on , it sends my data through google health as well .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
this is matthew anderson ,  UNK   UNK  and so on and so on .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
and the next morning , i woke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m a legal citizen .
but it does require a lot of planning .
you always lose rare animals .
and i went sailing on it , and we did surveys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the java sea .
right now in alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
yet i am afraid of privilege , of ease , of  UNK  .
we &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
but they don &apos;t perceive what happened before as a loss .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
in the possibilities of linking together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
so you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re  UNK  ourselves .
the categories need to say something to the  UNK  , not the  UNK  .
she was back and near death .
the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
i was riding in a 747 with marvin minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets  UNK  in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
here are two different jewelry displays .
her father died soon after she was born .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
but they do the job .
in my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , i &apos;ve made a personal study of medical  UNK  and medical errors to learn everything i can , from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to my show &quot; white coat , black art . &quot;
they were there in february , and it  UNK  a lot in february last year .
i felt like anyone could do that .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices .
he is my grandfather .
the other nurse asked  UNK  .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
in high school , a  UNK  once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test .
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the comeback trail .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
in those plans that offered nearly 60 funds , participation rates have now dropped to about the  UNK  percentile .
when i went there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half of their size .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
but each time , they were  UNK  at me , eating at me .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart .
instead of sending them off into the third world , we send them into the  UNK  of city hall .
they had been pushed genetically .
like here , we have mr.  UNK   UNK  from the city of kiev in ukraine .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
they will even use tools like state  UNK  to infect your computer with a  UNK  , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
let &apos;s say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i &apos;ve done it with .
all along , all fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps have been static .
the bricks are color-coded .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a  UNK  community .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
and i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
it will get to you .
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
here &apos;s their olive oil aisle .
and then she said , &quot; i just need you to promise me three things ,  UNK  . &quot;
i &apos;ve been illustrating books since i was 16 .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
now the question that i &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
hey , why not ?
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented .
even cats were watching this video .
okay . anybody who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
by being totally surprising and humorous , casey  UNK  got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
and i asked last week in a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the  UNK  hack .
we know perfectly where all the atms are about the city of  UNK  .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
and i went back to my work on the  UNK  .
i ordered a kidney x-ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a  UNK  of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
is it something about the details or the colors ?
UNK  , creative participating communities , complete  UNK  , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .
go home to where ?
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
i believe that for every person on the planet .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
centers were established .
UNK  ? check . living ? yep .
of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
an entire remix community  UNK  up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
i said , &quot; yes , sir . i did . &quot; and we started arguing .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done historically .
you can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little  UNK  .
for example , how a  UNK  works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
and i saw mrs.  UNK  , and she was  UNK  .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , lego came up with this .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
this was the  UNK  grouper .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot;
and here every piece is very well planned .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
or is it photography ?
i represent children .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam .
you know , the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
i will never forget it .
three times out of 10 .
thank you .
and i &apos;ve got here a little 100  UNK  of white powder , which i try not to let the security people see at airports .
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she &apos;d assault me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named erik  UNK  , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was  UNK  people , especially if they were disproportionately jewish ?
okay . thank you very much .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
it &apos;s not our burden .
for those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 funds , not 300 or more funds .
and this made me really sad .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
there &apos;s a guy in the i.t. department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , &quot; tell me how these choices are different from one another .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
you should ask for some of that .
no one has to  UNK  your idea .
these guys make money .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the debris , the piles of debris , were coral reef fish .
but ultimately , those realities are  UNK  by suffering , abuse , degradation ,  UNK  .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
i had written these crazy things .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
i don &apos;t know .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical  UNK  like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
in fact , one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
so in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all  UNK  .
if you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed , that means i &apos;m losing you .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
it turns out that in  UNK  grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor , the magazine aisles range anywhere from  UNK  different kinds of magazines all the way up to  UNK  .
and their pupils would dilate , they would  UNK  , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
people are always upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
but there are two problems with that .
and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of  UNK  analogous to sex . &quot;
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this  UNK  .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
and because government ultimately  UNK  its power from us -- remember &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a thief .
i was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto when mrs.  UNK  was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where i was working .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his throat .
which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem , which is  UNK  .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
my mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
this was my first  UNK  .
and i say , &quot; computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball  UNK  ?
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
and we built an ipad application .
but when something like this happens , things are  UNK  changing .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us  UNK  these  UNK  .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
they put her on a  UNK  .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we  UNK  did .
let me show you how they work .
and that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
this is a highly useless  UNK  scheme .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
but if i could give it and still see them safely through , i would .
so that &apos;s  UNK  movement has done .
we asked around and nobody knew .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
the only country in the world .
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
i would like to talk to you about why many  UNK  projects fail .
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
and i &apos;d go over there and i would , i would just listen .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged .
i was taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in melbourne .
so i followed my  UNK  .
and certainly , we could have been shoveling out those fire  UNK  all along , and many people do .
it would be  UNK  .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
how can i speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
the company headquarters are right here .
hi . i &apos;m kevin  UNK  , i &apos;m the trends manager at youtube , and i professionally watch youtube videos .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
and what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
no had never been an option .
now it turns out you &apos;re right .
so scott was speaking person-to-person .
we adjust our baseline to the new level , and we don &apos;t recall what was there .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
because  UNK  like jimmy  UNK  introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
we &apos;ve been giving  UNK  to kids and seeing them play with them .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
two pairs of  UNK  for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
here &apos;s a german car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car .
i &apos;m sitting here making  UNK  sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
i wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an  UNK  suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
privacy is  UNK  .
and i would look at her and i &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
so what was the next step ?
two years later i was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of toronto , and i saw a 25 year-old man with a  UNK  throat .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
so what happened on this day ?
it &apos;s not moving like that .
and this piece of 50-year-old technology became the most magical thing to me .
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
and this has spread just  UNK  , organically , naturally .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; what &apos;s up ?
and i have to tell you , it was  UNK  .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted . &quot;
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis .
and that &apos;s when i made my first mistake ; i sent her home .
they had 250 different kinds of  UNK  and  UNK  and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
and 90 percent of our catch were sponges , other animals that are fixed on the bottom .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
if you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
and in fact , i know , i &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am ,  UNK  , almost a generation older than most of them .
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
oh , my god . oh , my god .
she was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
and issue rogue certificates .
what do you do with certificates ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have , which is the choice overload problem .
oh , my god !
so half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 56 car colors , to low choice , four  UNK  .
you can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
a lot of my clients are very young .
i made the decision to move to the u.s.
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
so scott gets this call .
grants and sponsors were sought .
and now there are 10,000  UNK  of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
well i adored my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , mama . i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
these poor  UNK  have been trapped inside  UNK  &apos;s chambers for thousands of years in an old and  UNK  book .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
it &apos;s spreading virally .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .
and he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
and at the end of the day , i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don &apos;t usually do .
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have the death penalty in germany .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
he said , &quot; mr.  UNK  , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
what creates the illusion ?
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle  UNK  in new york city , i admit i wasn &apos;t very interested .
now i &apos;m going to describe to you a study i did with  UNK   UNK  ,  UNK   UNK  , wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about 650 plans all in the u.s.
is that all ?
so after a four-year  UNK  that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel .
after only one trip .
if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , clap your hands .
even though choosing  UNK  doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor , it still  UNK  me for how to choose .
there were gray whales in  UNK  bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
when proctor &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; shoulders to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent .
the redefined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but  UNK  to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
think about your own choices .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail , in prison , on  UNK  or  UNK  .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what are you doing in this  UNK  ? &quot;
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
and that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of tim o  UNK  , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
and on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
we set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
engines ,  UNK  -- four choices .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where i felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
this is not ...
and one time we caught a live one .
and in fact , if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , i &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
unlike the settled middle-class suburbs , whose existence i was oblivious of , there was no sense of  UNK  in  UNK  .
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they &apos;re fixing it .
why should i worry ?
okay , there &apos;s some .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as  UNK  , which is what the product is called , but also  UNK  .
it was not drowned yet .
very quickly concrete blocks became the  UNK  construction unit in the world .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be  UNK  around race , they &apos;re also distorted by poverty .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on  UNK  .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
i think it &apos;s very  UNK  of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were  UNK  .
and maybe i &apos;ve been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of  UNK  .
so i spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the  UNK  .
in urban communities across this country -- los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on  UNK  or  UNK  .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
